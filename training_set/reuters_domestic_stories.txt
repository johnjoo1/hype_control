President Barack Obama has failed so far to convince most Americans that the United States should launch a limited military strike against Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Tuesday.

Some 56 percent of those surveyed said the United States should not intervene in Syria, while only 19 percent supported action, the online poll found. Some 25 percent said they did not know what course of action the United States should take.

The findings are essentially unchanged from last week and indicated that Obama changed few minds on Saturday when he argued that Washington has the obligation to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for what the United States says was a sarin gas attack that killed more than 1,400 people, including hundreds of children, near Damascus on August 21.

The poll showed that respondents were more likely to support a strike if they were specifically asked about the chemical-weapons attack. Even then, only 29 percent said the United States should intervene, while 48 percent opposed action. Another 24 percent said they did not know.

Obama said on Saturday he had decided the United States should take military action against Syrian government targets but has asked Congress to approve the action in an acknowledgement that many Americans have little appetite for new military engagements after more than a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The U.S. public's reluctance to get involved in Syria closely mirrors public sentiment in the United Kingdom, where Parliament last week voted down a motion to support military action by the United States' closest ally.

In the United States, 65 percent of those surveyed in a separate tracking poll agreed with a statement that said "the problems of Syria are none of our business." In the United Kingdom, a parallel poll by Ipsos found that 58 percent agreed with that statement.

Similarly, only 29 percent support the Obama administration's decision to arm anti-government rebels in Syria, while 49 percent oppose that move. Another 21 percent said they didn't know whether they agreed or disagreed with that strategy.

The online poll of 1,195 adult Americans was conducted between August 30 and September 3. It has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.

frisk policy.

The council passed the measure 10 days ago, along with another bill creating an independent watchdog to monitor the New York Police Department, overriding the mayor's veto despite his warnings that the legislation would threaten public safety.

The council's votes came less than two weeks after a federal judge ruled that the department's stop-and-frisk policy, under which officers stop people in high-crime areas they suspect of engaging in criminal activity, is unconstitutional because it targets minorities disproportionately.

The bill that prompted Bloomberg's lawsuit expanded the definition of racial profiling and gives New Yorkers who believe they were targeted the right to sue police in state court.

The lawsuit, filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, asserted that the bill was invalid because it is superseded by the state's criminal procedure law, or CPL, which governs the standards and procedures that police officers must follow.

"The CPL preempts the field of criminal procedure legislation and prevents local legislatures, including the council, from passing local laws in this area," the lawsuit said.

The two bills passed by the City Council and the federal court ruling amounted to a sharp defeat for Bloomberg, who has defended stop-and-frisk as vital to the city's dramatic reduction in crime during the past two decades. He is set to leave office at the end of the year at the close of his third term as mayor.

City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, one of the leading Democratic mayoral candidates, voted against the racial profiling bill, though she voted for the bill that created an outside inspector general for the NYPD with subpoena power.

On Tuesday, however, she defended the City Council's right to legislate changes to the stop-and-frisk policy.

"Mayor Bloomberg can sue all he wants, but at the end of the day, we will successfully beat back this ill-advised litigation and ensure the prerogative of the city council to reform stop &amp; frisk," she said in an emailed statement.

Michael Cardozo, the city's top lawyer, said in a statement that the lawsuit was necessary to ensure the council did not overstep its authority.

"Local legislative bodies should not be passing laws affecting the regulation of law enforcement activity in this way," he said. "This is a matter governed by the state legislature."

The council originally passed the laws in June with a barely veto-proof majority, and Bloomberg vetoed them in July, challenging the council to override him.

The city has also appealed the federal ruling on stop-and-frisk from U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin, who called the strategy "indirect racial profiling" and appointed a monitor to oversee reforms to the street stops. The monitor, former chief city attorney Peter Zimroth, will work separately from the NYPD inspector general.



headline: Lawyers for Colorado theater gunman renew efforts to toss death penalty
byline: By Keith Coffman
8:31am EDT

Lawyers for accused theater gunman James Holmes, who could face execution if convicted of killing 12 Colorado moviegoers last year, have renewed their push to have the state's death penalty law ruled unconstitutional, court documents showed on Tuesday.

In a series of motions, public defenders for the former University of Colorado graduate student challenged the statute on several fronts, saying state lawmakers have passed "a dizzying assortment of overlapping laws" regarding capital punishment.

Holmes, 25, is charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder for opening fire in a suburban Denver movie theater during a screening of the Batman film "The Dark Knight Rises" last July.

The shooting rampage left 70 others wounded or injured, some of whom are now permanently paralyzed.

Defense lawyers noted in one motion that Colorado has executed just one convicted murderer in 46 years, and all three of the state's death-row inmates were tried and convicted in the same jurisdiction where Holmes is charged.

"Imposition of the death penalty is rare, unusual, freakish and inconsistently applied," defense lawyers wrote.

Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His lawyers have said in court filings that the California native was "in the throes of a psychotic episode" when he opened fire in the movie theater.

Defense attorneys also argued that aggravating factors that make a defendant death-penalty eligible under Colorado law, such as the killing of the youngest victim, six-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, are likewise "capricious."

"While the intentional killing of a child under 12 is undoubtedly an incredibly awful and tragic event, designating death-eligibility soley on the status of the victim is unconstitutionally arbitrary," the motion said.

Previous motions filed by Holmes' public defenders seeking to have Colorado's death-penalty statute ruled unconstitutional - under different theories - have been rejected.

Prosecutors have yet to file their responses. In previous filings they said Colorado's death-penalty law has been upheld by higher courts.

Former Denver prosecutor and legal analyst Craig Silverman said the defense is unlikely to prevail on the constitutional questions at the trial court level. They are, however, setting up possible appellate issues should Holmes be convicted and sentenced to death, he added.

"You never know what argument might resonate with a particular appeals court judge or the Colorado governor," said Silverman, referring to Governor John Hickenlooper, who earlier this year granted a reprieve to the state's longest-serving condemned prisoner who was scheduled to be executed last month.

Holmes' trial is scheduled to begin in early February.



headline: Massachusetts man sues local police, claims they planted evidence
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

A Lowell, Massachusetts, man who was arrested on drug charges last year sued the city and the arresting officer on Tuesday, claiming that the police department routinely used informants to plant evidence on suspects.

In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Boston, Jonathan Santiago claimed the city of Lowell and police Detective Thomas Lafferty violated his civil rights against unreasonable search and seizure and due process.

"For more than 20 years, the Lowell Police Department ignored its own written policies on the use of confidential informants," the suit claimed

Lowell's top attorney said that the Middlesex County district attorney reviewed for several months the incident that prompted the suit and found no evidence of wrongdoing.

"Their conclusion was that neither the city of Lowell nor in particular any members of their police department at any time engaged in any criminal or otherwise egregious activity in the course of performing their duties," said Christine O'Connor, city solicitor.

In February 2012, Santiago was driving to a local bar in Lowell, about 30 miles north of Boston, to meet an acquaintance for a drink when Detective Lafferty pulled him over and found cocaine tucked inside the gas cap of Santiago's car.

The suit charges that the acquaintance Santiago was meeting was a police informant who, working alone or with a partner, had planted the cocaine in the car with Lafferty's knowledge. After pulling Santiago over, Lafferty called for a police dog which found the drugs.

Santiago pleaded not guilty to a drug trafficking charge, which was dropped in March 2013 after the Middlesex County District Attorney launched a probe into the Lowell Police Department's use of informants, the suit contends.

That investigation came after one informant, who Santiago believed planted drugs on his car, approached the Massachusetts State Police to offer his services and "boasted about his skill and experience in planting evidence," the suit contends.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages.

A Massachusetts State Police spokesman declined to comment.

Lawsuits charging police or informants with planting evidence are rare, said Boston College Law School Professor Robert Bloom, because they are very hard to prove. The involvement of state police in this case increases the plaintiff's odds, he said.

"The element of proof is going to be on the state police," Bloom said. "They (plaintiffs) have a decent case, but otherwise this kind of situation would never see the light of day. The guy would have probably gone away or plea-bargained for lesser time."

Country prosecutors dropped charges or vacated convictions against 18 criminal defendants, including Santiago, as a result of the probe, according to local media reports.

Santiago's suit alleges violations of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of due process.

The suit comes on the heels of a scandal at a Massachusetts state crime lab in which a former chemist has been charged with faking drug test results -- confirming that evidence brought in by police was in fact illicit narcotics simply by looking at it, rather than through chemical testing.

That chemist, Annie Dookhan, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. More than 300 prisoners have been released pending new trials because Dookhan played a role in their conditions and a state review last month found that she had handled evidence in more than 40,000 cases in total.



headline: Grim search for remains at ex-Florida reform school ends for now
byline: By Bill Cotterell
8:31am EDT

Researchers wound up the first phase of their grim work in the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday, after hunting for the remains of young boys believed to have been secretly buried more than 50 years ago at a notorious reform school.

Erin Kimmerle, a University of South Florida anthropologist who headed the four-day excavation near the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida, said the skeletal remains of two youths had been recovered and would undergo DNA analysis.

Ground-penetrating radar has indicated that as many as 50 graves are located in an area outside the now-padlocked school known as "boot hill."

Throughout its 111-year history, the Dozier School was known as a dreaded lock-up for juvenile offenders from across Florida.

Almost 100 detainees were known to have died at or disappeared from the 1,400-acre (566-hectare) institution near the Alabama border - mainly black youths whose families had no way of learning what happened to them in an era of legal racism in the South.

Especially notorious was "the White House," a small brick building where former inmates -- now in their 60s and 70s -- say boys were regularly beaten, raped, tortured and probably killed.

"Our objective was two or three," said Kimmerle of the four-day dig. "Given the rain and the conditions, we just stopped at two," she told reporters.

Kimmerle, who worked with international teams unearthing evidence of mass graves used in war crimes trials stemming from the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, plans to resume work at the site later this year, possibly as early as next month.

With small shovels, sometimes bare hands, the researchers toiled in gnat-infested woods across a busy highway from the Dozier School, which the state closed in 2011.

They concentrated on the area around the initial two graves excavated, finding coffin wood, hinges, brass pins from a burial shroud and some buttons - along with dental and skeletal remains that Kimmerle said appeared to be those of boys between 10 and 13 years old.

There was no way of determining cause of death for either youth, Kimmerle said. One grave had "elaborate coffin hardware" that looked like it dated back to sometime "probably after the 1930s," but the other contained plain wood, she said.

Florida has no statute of limitations for murder, but police and prosecutors do not expect anyone to be held legally accountable for deaths at the school.

The recovered remains are being handled like evidence nonetheless, locked in secure boxes for laboratory examination first at USF and then at the University of North Texas.

Kimmerle said 10 DNA samples have been taken from known family members of victims, so remains found at the site can be matched to living descendants and bones can be given to families for re-burial.

"The mission is really for the families...That's why we're here," she said.

The Florida legislature appropriated $190,000 for the work and the U.S. Justice Department approved a $423,000 grant for DNA matching.



headline: Detroit defends contested swaps deal as key to city's survival
byline: By Joseph Lichterman and Karen Pierog
8:31am EDT

rate swaps contracts as the city scrambled to guarantee access to cash in the days before its bankruptcy filing, according to depositions by the city's emergency manager and a key financial adviser.

The city has asked the federal judge overseeing its historic municipal bankruptcy filing to approve the deal with Merrill Lynch and UBS AG, which would allow Detroit to end the swaps at a discount and give it unfettered access to casino tax revenue. The casino money served as collateral for the swaps contracts.

Creditors led by bond insurer Syncora Guarantee are objecting to the deal, and late last week grilled Kevyn Orr, Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, and Kenneth Buckfire, Orr's top outside financial consultant, ahead of a hearing on the objections in U.S. bankruptcy court.

Syncora and others claim the deal favors the swap counterparties over other creditors and would eliminate casino revenue, which totals about $180 million a year, as a potential source for paying Detroit's obligations.

In sworn depositions taken by attorneys for insurers and bondholders, Orr and Buckfire described the contentious negotiations leading to the July 15 agreement with Merrill Lynch Capital Services, a unit of Bank of America, and UBS AG.

Buckfire said he believed the city was in a "life and death" predicament as the swaps counterparties threatened to declare Detroit in default and demand payment the city could not afford.

Orr said before reaching agreement with Merrill and UBS, the city had also considered contesting the validity of the swaps. Originally agreed to in conjunction with the sale in 2005 and 2006 of $1.4 billion of debt for the city's two pension funds, the contracts hedge against interest rate changes.

He declined to describe how the city might challenge the contracts, citing attorney-client privilege.

Orr also argued the deal with Merrill Lynch and UBS was needed to head off a Detroit cash crisis by year end. "If we don't have this agreement, there's a very real chance, yes, in a steady state, we will run out of cash," he said.

At the time of the agreement, Orr said, the city lacked enough cash to fund a termination payment in the range of $200 million to Merrill and UBS, and he expected no financial bailout from the state of Michigan or the U.S. government.

Buckfire, co-founder and co-president of Miller, Buckfire &amp; Co, gave the most detailed description yet of tense negotiations with Merrill Lynch and UBS in June as the city ran dangerously low on cash.

A mid-May analysis of Detroit's finances by Ernst &amp; Young prompted Buckfire to seek Orr's approval to enter the negotiations. Without a deal, Buckfire said he believed Detroit was at risk of losing access to the casino revenues.

Buckfire set up the June 4 meeting after advising Orr the city could not risk having its swaps counterparties declare a default and cut off access to the casino money. "The city's ability to operate would be in severe jeopardy and it became a life or death issue for the city," he testified.

Entering the June 4 meeting, the city estimated it would owe $400 million in cash if the swaps counterparties declared Detroit in default, Buckfire said. With no default, the city owed the counterparties only $50 million a year, he said.

At the meeting, which Buckfire described as "very tense and difficult," the city stated it was seeking a deal because Detroit could not meet its obligations.

"They were extremely aggressive toward the city," Buckfire recalled. "They brought up several times the fact that the city had been in default since 2012, that we continue to add defaults to our pile of defaults."

Buckfire said he interpreted the statements as a threat to terminate the swaps. "It was a direct risk on the city's survival," he said.

Talks continued a few days later, with the city facing a June 15 deadline for a payment to bondholders that the city could not afford. "We felt compelled to complete a business agreement with them prior to that date in order to protect the city at all costs," Buckfire said.

He added that the agreement with the swaps counterparties was aimed at three objectives: to guarantee continued access to casino revenues; to eliminate swaps counterparties as creditors in the event of a bankruptcy filing, and to help the city obtain financing at some point in the future.

Orr, in his response to questions, reviewed issues related to the city's bankruptcy filing. Orr did not make the decision until three days before the Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing and engaged in contingency planning until then, he said.

The city manager also said an investigation into the validity of the $1.4 billion of pension debt was ongoing and he hinted Detroit may be probing the validity of contracts with its pension funds that led to the debt sale. If the pension debt was improperly issued, that could call into question the validity of the swaps agreements.

Orr said the examination, disclosed in a previous court filing, includes a "whole panoply of issues," including the cost and duration of any litigation that might challenge the debt.

Even if the swaps were not valid, there may be other "prudential reasons" the city would seek to terminate them, Orr said. Termination could give Detroit unencumbered access to casino cash worth about $11 million a month to the city.

Orr also acknowledged that he hoped the forbearance agreement on the swaps contracts might prompt other creditors and labor unions to strike their own deals.

"We were hoping to get a round of agreements in place," Orr testified, according to his deposition transcript. However, no subsequent agreements were reached.



headline: Mississippi alligator hunting season gets off to a record start
byline: By Emily Le Coz
8:31am EDT

day alligator season by bagging some of the biggest critters on the books.

Within hours of the August 30 opener, one hunting party caught the state's longest and heaviest female gator at 10 feet and 295.3 pounds (134 kg), according to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.

A second record was broken shortly after midnight on September 1, when a different group of hunters nabbed the state's heaviest male alligator at 723.5 pounds (328 kg).

That distinction lasted about an hour, until another party captured one weighing 727 pounds (330 kg), and measuring 13 feet (3.96 m.)

Dustin Bockman, a 27-year-old UPS driver, and his crew spotted the mammoth creature in the Mississippi River and trailed it for two hours before getting close enough to spear it. It took another two hours to hook it with a second line and noose its neck.

Eventually, Bockman had to shoot the alligator.

It took another two hours and two extra men to hoist the gator on the boat, capping a grueling hunt that had Bockman's girlfriend understandably nervous.

"I had sent him a text message at four in the morning, asking him, 窶連re you alive?'" said Amy Parsons. "I was afraid. I hadn't heard from him all night and he hadn't come home."

Larger alligators have been trapped in Florida, weighing up to 1,000 pounds (454 kg), and one last year measured 14-feet.

This is Mississippi's ninth annual alligator season in a sport with growing popularity, said the state's alligator program coordinator Ricky Flynt.

"It is quite an adventure and is perceived as being dangerous game," he said.

Despite its inherent dangers, alligator hunting has produced just one injury in Mississippi, Flynt said. A man required surgery to his thumb after getting bit while trying to reel in a gator.

Flynt attributed the multiple records to an expanded territory - this is the first year Mississippi has allowed statewide hunting - and to normal water levels in the rivers. Last year's droughts hindered the hunts, he said, despite a total haul of 513.

Mississippi does a lottery for alligator hunting licenses. More than 7,100 people applied this year and the state gave out just 920 permits. Also, the state requires hunters attend a mandatory alligator hunting safety course.



headline: Rodman returns to Pyongyang but says won't bring back jailed American
byline: By James Pearson and Megha Rajagopalan

day visit, his second this year, but said he had no plans to negotiate the release of a jailed American missionary.

There had been speculation that Rodman, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in March, would secure the release of Kenneth Bae, who was jailed for 15 years for trying to overthrow the North Korean government.

"I'm not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae," Rodman told Reuters in a telephone interview before he left Beijing for Pyongyang. "I'm just going there on another basketball diplomacy tour."

Kim, the third of his line to rule North Korea, is a basketball fan and appeared to get on well with Rodman on the earlier visit, with the two of them pictured laughing, eating and drinking together and watching an all-star basketball match.

Rodman's latest trip is being sponsored by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power. His arrival was announced on North Korean news agency KCNA, which did not provide any further details of the trip.

Wearing his trademark dark sunglasses, the 6-foot 7-inch (2.01 meter) Rodman pushed through a throng of journalists at Beijing's international airport, a common waystation for travelers to North Korea.

"I'm just trying to go over there to meet my friend Kim, the Marshal," Rodman said. "Try to start a basketball league over there, something like that."

North Korea cancelled a visit by Robert King, U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues, to Pyongyang last week on what the U.S. State Department said was a "humanitarian mission" to negotiate the release of Bae.

King's trip was initially seen as a signal that relations between Washington and Pyongyang might start to improve. North Korea said it withdrew the invitation because of annual military drills last week by the United States and South Korea.

Rodman drew fire for his earlier trip to Pyongyang at a time when North Korea was threatening the United States, South Korea and Japan with missile strikes.

He called Kim, 30, who rules unchallenged in a country where there are an estimated 150,000-200,000 prisoners in work camps, "an awesome kid".

Bae, a Korean American who had been working as a Christian missionary in China and North Korea, was arrested in the northeast port city of Rason late last year.

The North Korean supreme court said it sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor for plotting to overthrow the state. It said he had secretly brought "propaganda materials", including a National Geographic documentary on life in North Korea, into the isolated country.

Bae, who had trained with missionary organization Youth With a Mission, ran a tour group called Nation Tours in China that specialized in trips to North Korea. In a video of a 2009 sermon to a Korean-American church in St. Louis, Bae said he planned to bring fellow Christians into Rason.

North Korea says it permits religious freedom, but religious expression is tightly controlled in a state that acknowledges total loyalty to the Kim dynasty that has ruled for three generations. North Korea lands at the bottom of most independent surveys of freedom.

Bae's family has acknowledged his deeply held religious beliefs but has suggested that his sympathy for North Korean orphans may have been behind his arrest.



headline: Montana judge says month-long prison term for rape may be too lenient
byline: By Laura Zuckerman
8:31am EDT

teacher to a month in prison for raping a teenage student who later killed herself said on Tuesday his penalty may have been more lenient than allowed by law and called a new hearing.

District Judge G. Todd Baugh faced fierce criticism last week for sentencing former Billings high school teacher Stacey Rambold to 15 years in prison, then suspending all but 31 days of the term for the 2007 rape of 14-year-old Cherice Moralez in his home.

Before handing down the sentence, in remarks he would later apologize for, Baugh described the girl as a troubled youth who seemed older than her age and was "probably as much in control of the situation" as Rambold.

Baugh's comments sparked an outpouring of rage by women's rights activists who protested outside the judge's offices and launched a campaign for his resignation. Prosecutors said they planned to appeal the sentence.

On Tuesday Baugh said he had reviewed his sentencing decision and it appeared Montana law mandated a two-year minimum sentence for the crime. He set a new hearing for Friday.

"In this court's opinion, imposing a sentence which suspends more than the mandatory minimum would be an illegal sentence," Baugh wrote in his order.

Rambold had been charged by Yellowstone County prosecutors in 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, the Montana equivalent of rape, linked to Moralez, a student in a technology class he taught at Senior High School in Billings.

Moralez killed herself in 2010 before the case could go to trial, crippling a prosecution case that depended on her testimony.

In an agreement with prosecutors later that year, Rambold admitted to a single count of sexual intercourse without consent and prosecutors agreed to postpone the case for three years and dismiss it entirely if Rambold completed sex offender treatment.

Prosecutors reinstated the case after being notified last year by the treatment center that Rambold, who was suspended in 2008 from his teaching post and later resigned, had been dismissed from the program for violating its rules.

In April, Rambold pleaded guilty to the rape charge stemming from the assault of Moralez in his Billings home, according to legal documents.

President Barack Obama has failed so far to convince most Americans that the United States should launch a limited military strike against Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Tuesday.

Some 56 percent of those surveyed said the United States should not intervene in Syria, while only 19 percent supported action, the online poll found. Some 25 percent said they did not know what course of action the United States should take.

The findings are essentially unchanged from last week and indicated that Obama changed few minds on Saturday when he argued that Washington has the obligation to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for what the United States says was a sarin gas attack that killed more than 1,400 people, including hundreds of children, near Damascus on August 21.

The poll showed that respondents were more likely to support a strike if they were specifically asked about the chemical-weapons attack. Even then, only 29 percent said the United States should intervene, while 48 percent opposed action. Another 24 percent said they did not know.

Obama said on Saturday he had decided the United States should take military action against Syrian government targets but has asked Congress to approve the action in an acknowledgement that many Americans have little appetite for new military engagements after more than a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The U.S. public's reluctance to get involved in Syria closely mirrors public sentiment in the United Kingdom, where Parliament last week voted down a motion to support military action by the United States' closest ally.

In the United States, 65 percent of those surveyed in a separate tracking poll agreed with a statement that said "the problems of Syria are none of our business." In the United Kingdom, a parallel poll by Ipsos found that 58 percent agreed with that statement.

Similarly, only 29 percent support the Obama administration's decision to arm anti-government rebels in Syria, while 49 percent oppose that move. Another 21 percent said they didn't know whether they agreed or disagreed with that strategy.

The online poll of 1,195 adult Americans was conducted between August 30 and September 3. It has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.

A Lowell, Massachusetts, man who was arrested on drug charges last year sued the city and the arresting officer on Tuesday, claiming that the police department routinely used informants to plant evidence on suspects.

"For more than 20 years, the Lowell Police Department ignored its own written policies on the use of confidential informants," the suit claimed

Lowell's top attorney said that the Middlesex County district attorney reviewed for several months the incident that prompted the suit and found no evidence of wrongdoing.

"Their conclusion was that neither the city of Lowell nor in particular any members of their police department at any time engaged in any criminal or otherwise egregious activity in the course of performing their duties," said Christine O'Connor, city solicitor.

In February 2012, Santiago was driving to a local bar in Lowell, about 30 miles north of Boston, to meet an acquaintance for a drink when Detective Lafferty pulled him over and found cocaine tucked inside the gas cap of Santiago's car.

The suit charges that the acquaintance Santiago was meeting was a police informant who, working alone or with a partner, had planted the cocaine in the car with Lafferty's knowledge. After pulling Santiago over, Lafferty called for a police dog which found the drugs.

Santiago pleaded not guilty to a drug trafficking charge, which was dropped in March 2013 after the Middlesex County District Attorney launched a probe into the Lowell Police Department's use of informants, the suit contends.

That investigation came after one informant, who Santiago believed planted drugs on his car, approached the Massachusetts State Police to offer his services and "boasted about his skill and experience in planting evidence," the suit contends.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages.

A Massachusetts State Police spokesman declined to comment.

Lawsuits charging police or informants with planting evidence are rare, said Boston College Law School Professor Robert Bloom, because they are very hard to prove. The involvement of state police in this case increases the plaintiff's odds, he said.

"The element of proof is going to be on the state police," Bloom said. "They (plaintiffs) have a decent case, but otherwise this kind of situation would never see the light of day. The guy would have probably gone away or plea-bargained for lesser time."

Country prosecutors dropped charges or vacated convictions against 18 criminal defendants, including Santiago, as a result of the probe, according to local media reports.

Santiago's suit alleges violations of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of due process.

The suit comes on the heels of a scandal at a Massachusetts state crime lab in which a former chemist has been charged with faking drug test results -- confirming that evidence brought in by police was in fact illicit narcotics simply by looking at it, rather than through chemical testing.

That chemist, Annie Dookhan, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. More than 300 prisoners have been released pending new trials because Dookhan played a role in their conditions and a state review last month found that she had handled evidence in more than 40,000 cases in total.

headline: Detroit defends contested swaps deal as key to city's survival
byline: By Joseph Lichterman and Karen Pierog
8:31am EDT

rate swaps contracts as the city scrambled to guarantee access to cash in the days before its bankruptcy filing, according to depositions by the city's emergency manager and a key financial adviser.

The city has asked the federal judge overseeing its historic municipal bankruptcy filing to approve the deal with Merrill Lynch and UBS AG, which would allow Detroit to end the swaps at a discount and give it unfettered access to casino tax revenue. The casino money served as collateral for the swaps contracts.

Creditors led by bond insurer Syncora Guarantee are objecting to the deal, and late last week grilled Kevyn Orr, Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, and Kenneth Buckfire, Orr's top outside financial consultant, ahead of a hearing on the objections in U.S. bankruptcy court.

Syncora and others claim the deal favors the swap counterparties over other creditors and would eliminate casino revenue, which totals about $180 million a year, as a potential source for paying Detroit's obligations.

In sworn depositions taken by attorneys for insurers and bondholders, Orr and Buckfire described the contentious negotiations leading to the July 15 agreement with Merrill Lynch Capital Services, a unit of Bank of America, and UBS AG.

Buckfire said he believed the city was in a "life and death" predicament as the swaps counterparties threatened to declare Detroit in default and demand payment the city could not afford.

Orr said before reaching agreement with Merrill and UBS, the city had also considered contesting the validity of the swaps. Originally agreed to in conjunction with the sale in 2005 and 2006 of $1.4 billion of debt for the city's two pension funds, the contracts hedge against interest rate changes.

He declined to describe how the city might challenge the contracts, citing attorney-client privilege.

Orr also argued the deal with Merrill Lynch and UBS was needed to head off a Detroit cash crisis by year end. "If we don't have this agreement, there's a very real chance, yes, in a steady state, we will run out of cash," he said.

At the time of the agreement, Orr said, the city lacked enough cash to fund a termination payment in the range of $200 million to Merrill and UBS, and he expected no financial bailout from the state of Michigan or the U.S. government.

Buckfire, co-founder and co-president of Miller, Buckfire &amp; Co, gave the most detailed description yet of tense negotiations with Merrill Lynch and UBS in June as the city ran dangerously low on cash.

A mid-May analysis of Detroit's finances by Ernst &amp; Young prompted Buckfire to seek Orr's approval to enter the negotiations. Without a deal, Buckfire said he believed Detroit was at risk of losing access to the casino revenues.

Buckfire set up the June 4 meeting after advising Orr the city could not risk having its swaps counterparties declare a default and cut off access to the casino money. "The city's ability to operate would be in severe jeopardy and it became a life or death issue for the city," he testified.

Entering the June 4 meeting, the city estimated it would owe $400 million in cash if the swaps counterparties declared Detroit in default, Buckfire said. With no default, the city owed the counterparties only $50 million a year, he said.

At the meeting, which Buckfire described as "very tense and difficult," the city stated it was seeking a deal because Detroit could not meet its obligations.

"They were extremely aggressive toward the city," Buckfire recalled. "They brought up several times the fact that the city had been in default since 2012, that we continue to add defaults to our pile of defaults."

Buckfire said he interpreted the statements as a threat to terminate the swaps. "It was a direct risk on the city's survival," he said.

Talks continued a few days later, with the city facing a June 15 deadline for a payment to bondholders that the city could not afford. "We felt compelled to complete a business agreement with them prior to that date in order to protect the city at all costs," Buckfire said.

He added that the agreement with the swaps counterparties was aimed at three objectives: to guarantee continued access to casino revenues; to eliminate swaps counterparties as creditors in the event of a bankruptcy filing, and to help the city obtain financing at some point in the future.

Orr, in his response to questions, reviewed issues related to the city's bankruptcy filing. Orr did not make the decision until three days before the Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing and engaged in contingency planning until then, he said.

The city manager also said an investigation into the validity of the $1.4 billion of pension debt was ongoing and he hinted Detroit may be probing the validity of contracts with its pension funds that led to the debt sale. If the pension debt was improperly issued, that could call into question the validity of the swaps agreements.

Orr said the examination, disclosed in a previous court filing, includes a "whole panoply of issues," including the cost and duration of any litigation that might challenge the debt.

Even if the swaps were not valid, there may be other "prudential reasons" the city would seek to terminate them, Orr said. Termination could give Detroit unencumbered access to casino cash worth about $11 million a month to the city.

Orr also acknowledged that he hoped the forbearance agreement on the swaps contracts might prompt other creditors and labor unions to strike their own deals.

"We were hoping to get a round of agreements in place," Orr testified, according to his deposition transcript. However, no subsequent agreements were reached.



headline: Mississippi alligator hunting season gets off to a record start
byline: By Emily Le Coz
8:31am EDT

day alligator season by bagging some of the biggest critters on the books.

Within hours of the August 30 opener, one hunting party caught the state's longest and heaviest female gator at 10 feet and 295.3 pounds (134 kg), according to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.

A second record was broken shortly after midnight on September 1, when a different group of hunters nabbed the state's heaviest male alligator at 723.5 pounds (328 kg).

That distinction lasted about an hour, until another party captured one weighing 727 pounds (330 kg), and measuring 13 feet (3.96 m.)

Dustin Bockman, a 27-year-old UPS driver, and his crew spotted the mammoth creature in the Mississippi River and trailed it for two hours before getting close enough to spear it. It took another two hours to hook it with a second line and noose its neck.

Eventually, Bockman had to shoot the alligator.

It took another two hours and two extra men to hoist the gator on the boat, capping a grueling hunt that had Bockman's girlfriend understandably nervous.

"I had sent him a text message at four in the morning, asking him, 窶連re you alive?'" said Amy Parsons. "I was afraid. I hadn't heard from him all night and he hadn't come home."

Larger alligators have been trapped in Florida, weighing up to 1,000 pounds (454 kg), and one last year measured 14-feet.

This is Mississippi's ninth annual alligator season in a sport with growing popularity, said the state's alligator program coordinator Ricky Flynt.

"It is quite an adventure and is perceived as being dangerous game," he said.

Despite its inherent dangers, alligator hunting has produced just one injury in Mississippi, Flynt said. A man required surgery to his thumb after getting bit while trying to reel in a gator.

Flynt attributed the multiple records to an expanded territory - this is the first year Mississippi has allowed statewide hunting - and to normal water levels in the rivers. Last year's droughts hindered the hunts, he said, despite a total haul of 513.

Mississippi does a lottery for alligator hunting licenses. More than 7,100 people applied this year and the state gave out just 920 permits. Also, the state requires hunters attend a mandatory alligator hunting safety course.



headline: Rodman returns to Pyongyang but says won't bring back jailed American
byline: By James Pearson and Megha Rajagopalan
8:31am EDT

day visit, his second this year, but said he had no plans to negotiate the release of a jailed American missionary.

There had been speculation that Rodman, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in March, would secure the release of Kenneth Bae, who was jailed for 15 years for trying to overthrow the North Korean government.

"I'm not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae," Rodman told Reuters in a telephone interview before he left Beijing for Pyongyang. "I'm just going there on another basketball diplomacy tour."

Kim, the third of his line to rule North Korea, is a basketball fan and appeared to get on well with Rodman on the earlier visit, with the two of them pictured laughing, eating and drinking together and watching an all-star basketball match.

Rodman's latest trip is being sponsored by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power. His arrival was announced on North Korean news agency KCNA, which did not provide any further details of the trip.

Wearing his trademark dark sunglasses, the 6-foot 7-inch (2.01 meter) Rodman pushed through a throng of journalists at Beijing's international airport, a common waystation for travelers to North Korea.

"I'm just trying to go over there to meet my friend Kim, the Marshal," Rodman said. "Try to start a basketball league over there, something like that."

North Korea cancelled a visit by Robert King, U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues, to Pyongyang last week on what the U.S. State Department said was a "humanitarian mission" to negotiate the release of Bae.

King's trip was initially seen as a signal that relations between Washington and Pyongyang might start to improve. North Korea said it withdrew the invitation because of annual military drills last week by the United States and South Korea.

Rodman drew fire for his earlier trip to Pyongyang at a time when North Korea was threatening the United States, South Korea and Japan with missile strikes.

He called Kim, 30, who rules unchallenged in a country where there are an estimated 150,000-200,000 prisoners in work camps, "an awesome kid".

Bae, a Korean American who had been working as a Christian missionary in China and North Korea, was arrested in the northeast port city of Rason late last year.

The North Korean supreme court said it sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor for plotting to overthrow the state. It said he had secretly brought "propaganda materials", including a National Geographic documentary on life in North Korea, into the isolated country.

Bae, who had trained with missionary organization Youth With a Mission, ran a tour group called Nation Tours in China that specialized in trips to North Korea. In a video of a 2009 sermon to a Korean-American church in St. Louis, Bae said he planned to bring fellow Christians into Rason.

North Korea says it permits religious freedom, but religious expression is tightly controlled in a state that acknowledges total loyalty to the Kim dynasty that has ruled for three generations. North Korea lands at the bottom of most independent surveys of freedom.

Bae's family has acknowledged his deeply held religious beliefs but has suggested that his sympathy for North Korean orphans may have been behind his arrest.



headline: Montana judge says month-long prison term for rape may be too lenient
byline: By Laura Zuckerman
8:31am EDT

teacher to a month in prison for raping a teenage student who later killed herself said on Tuesday his penalty may have been more lenient than allowed by law and called a new hearing.

District Judge G. Todd Baugh faced fierce criticism last week for sentencing former Billings high school teacher Stacey Rambold to 15 years in prison, then suspending all but 31 days of the term for the 2007 rape of 14-year-old Cherice Moralez in his home.

Before handing down the sentence, in remarks he would later apologize for, Baugh described the girl as a troubled youth who seemed older than her age and was "probably as much in control of the situation" as Rambold.

Baugh's comments sparked an outpouring of rage by women's rights activists who protested outside the judge's offices and launched a campaign for his resignation. Prosecutors said they planned to appeal the sentence.

On Tuesday Baugh said he had reviewed his sentencing decision and it appeared Montana law mandated a two-year minimum sentence for the crime. He set a new hearing for Friday.

"In this court's opinion, imposing a sentence which suspends more than the mandatory minimum would be an illegal sentence," Baugh wrote in his order.

Rambold had been charged by Yellowstone County prosecutors in 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, the Montana equivalent of rape, linked to Moralez, a student in a technology class he taught at Senior High School in Billings.

Moralez killed herself in 2010 before the case could go to trial, crippling a prosecution case that depended on her testimony.

In an agreement with prosecutors later that year, Rambold admitted to a single count of sexual intercourse without consent and prosecutors agreed to postpone the case for three years and dismiss it entirely if Rambold completed sex offender treatment.

Prosecutors reinstated the case after being notified last year by the treatment center that Rambold, who was suspended in 2008 from his teaching post and later resigned, had been dismissed from the program for violating its rules.

In April, Rambold pleaded guilty to the rape charge stemming from the assault of Moralez in his Billings home, according to legal documents.



headline: Grim search for remains at ex-Florida reform school ends for now
byline: By Bill Cotterell
8:31am EDT

Researchers completed on Tuesday their initial search for the remains of juveniles believed to have been secretly buried more than 50 years ago at a notorious former reform school in the Florida Panhandle.

Anthropologists, archaeologists, graduate students from the University of South Florida (USF) and law-enforcement volunteers labored in sweltering heat at a gnat-swarmed burial ground near the Arthur G. Dozier School, which the state closed in 2011.

Families of youths sent there over half a century ago have been badgering state officials for years, forcing an investigation of the area known as "boot hill," where ground-penetrating radar spotted at least 50 graves.

Erin Kimmerle, a USF forensic anthropologist who worked with international teams unearthing evidence of mass graves used in Yugoslavian war-crimes trials, headed the excavation project that began on Saturday.

She said about two-dozen scientists, students and Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office volunteers helped with the painstaking excavation in the pine-shrouded hillsides of rural Jackson County, near the Alabama border.

Christian Wells, another USF anthropologist, said some small pieces of large bones were recovered on Saturday, along with some coffin hinges and brass pins from burial shrouds. More skeletal remains were unearthed on Sunday.

The human remains will be examined for DNA evidence at the University of North Texas. Some DNA samples have been taken from family members of youths who died or simply disappeared from Dozier decades ago, and material from the bones will be checked against those records.

Any remains that are identified will be turned over to families for reburial, and unidentified bones will be re-interred with scientific records kept in case any family members come forward.

Kimmerle and USF researchers spent months going through old public records, news clippings and family accounts of boys who were sent to Dozier, a 1,400-acre (566-hectare) rural area.

Former students, now in their 60s, tell of beatings, sexual abuse and sometimes disappearances of teenage boys - mostly African American- who were locked up for juvenile offenses in the 1930s through 1960s.

The Florida Legislature put up $190,000 for the dig and the U.S. Department of Justice provided $423,000 for DNA matching.

Kimmerle plans to bring her teams back to the scene later this year for further exploration of known graves and a search for more burial sites.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement ended a separate investigation into Dozier in 2010, saying it could not substantiate or refute claims that anyone held at the school died at the hands of staff.



headline: Florida family finds $300,000 worth of sunken treasure
byline: By Barbara Liston
8:31am EDT

A Florida family who spends their time together hunting for treasure struck it rich over the weekend, hauling up an estimated $300,000 worth of gold from an historic wreckage in the Atlantic Ocean.

"What's really neat about them is they are a family, they spend family time together out there and the most amazing part about them is they always believed this day would come," said Brent Brisben, whose company 1715 Fleet - Queens Jewels LLC owns the rights to the wreckage.

Brisben said Rick and Lisa Schmitt, and their grown children Hillary and Eric, found gold chains and coins from the wreckage of a convoy of 11 ships that went down in a hurricane off the coast of Florida in 1715 en route from Havana to Spain.

The ships' manifests indicate that about $400 million worth of treasure was on board, of which $175 million has been recovered, Brisben said.

His company bought the rights to the wreck site from the heirs of legendary treasure hunter Mel Fisher in 2010 and allows others, including the Schmitts, to search under subcontracting agreements.

Brisben said the Schmitts, who live in Sanford, Florida, have been searching for treasure for years. Eric Schmitt, who made the latest haul, also found a silver platter worth about $25,000 in 2002 when he was a high school sophomore.

Under U.S. and Florida law, the treasure will be placed into the custody of the U.S. District Court in South Florida. The state of Florida will be allowed to take possession of up to 20 percent of the find for display in a state museum. The remainder will be split evenly between Brisben's company and the Schmitt family, he said.

Brisben said the story of the 1715 wreckage was used as a basis for the 1977 film "The Deep" and for the 2008 film "Fool's Gold".

headline: Senator Levin 'confident' U.S. will step up support for Syrian rebels
byline: By Susan Cornwell
8:31am EDT

The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said on Tuesday he was confident after talking with President Barack Obama that the United States would step up its support for "vetted" elements of the Syrian opposition.

Senator Carl Levin said he urged the president, a fellow Democrat, to arm the Syrian rebels a day after two influential Republican senators, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, sought similar assurances from Obama, who is trying to persuade lawmakers to authorize limited U.S. military action in Syria.

"I am confident after being in the Oval Office with the president this morning and the vice president and others, that we are going to make more robust our support for the Syrian opposition that is vetted," Levin told reporters.

Levin's reference to a "vetted" Syrian opposition reflects U.S. concerns about American weapons falling into the hands of certain rebel groups including those allied with the al Qaeda network responsible for the 2001 attacks on the United States. The rebels are seeking to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Levin, a prominent Democratic voice on military matters, said he told the White House that the United States should provide rebels with arms such as anti-tank weapons "which cannot be turned on us."

"My plea to the president ... is that we facilitate a vetted opposition to help to degrade Assad's capability to use chemical weapons," Levin said.

McCain and Graham emerged from a White House meeting on Monday saying they believed Obama was willing to do more than fire off cruise missiles, and that he wanted to bolster the Syrian opposition.

Obama has been meeting with lawmakers as part of his attempt to secure congressional approval for a possible military strike in response to what the United States says was a sarin gas attack by the Syrian government that killed more than 1,400 people near Damascus on August 21.

Levin said that it would be difficult for U.S. cruise missiles to effectively target the components of the Syrian military that had used the chemical weapons, such as their artillery and rocket launchers. He said it would be easier to provide Syrian rebels with the armed capability to go after those components.

"The opposition in Syria has the power - if we facilitate them having this power, if we provide the weapons or have others provide certain key weapons, including anti-tank capabilities - to go after the Syrian military that used the chemical weapons," Levin said.

The White House said in June it had decided to provide military aid to Syrian rebels. But rebel sources have said no U.S.-provided weapons have arrived. U.S. officials have been concerned weapons could reach factions like the Nusra Front, one of the most effective rebel groups fighting Assad but one which is also seen as linked to al Qaeda.



headline: 74-year-old first Vermont man to be fined, not jailed, for pot growing
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

old man $200 for marijuana he grew from seed at his apartment, in the state's first civil penalty under a new law that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of pot.

William Reynolds, of Saint Johnsbury, Vermont, was ticketed last week after police followed up on a complaint about "a suspicious plant" at the apartment complex where Reynolds lived in the town about 30 miles northeast of Montpelier, Detective Daniele Kostruba said on Tuesday.

"I did locate the plant," she said. "It definitely looked like a marijuana plant."

Reynolds told police he had grown the 2.5-foot plant from a seed he had had for years, and that he was "just experimenting," according to Kostruba.

She said it was the first penalty of its kind levied in Vermont since Governor Peter Shumlin signed a bill in June that made the state the 17th in the United States to decriminalize possession of less than 1 ounce (28.3 grams) of marijuana.

Under the law, possession of small amounts is treated as a civil penalty with fines akin to a traffic ticket. Previously, possession of up to two ounces (56.6 grams) of pot was a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail for a first offense and up to two years for later offenses.

Vermont's law is similar to those in California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island, where non-medical possession of marijuana is treated as a civil offense.

Civil penalties for marijuana possession have been imposed in states such as Massachusetts and Nebraska, according to local media reports.

Vermont has not gone as far as Washington and Colorado, where laws allowing the recreational use of marijuana by adults passed last year.

Last week, the Obama administration allowed those states to move forward with the new laws as part of a shift toward giving U.S. states wide leeway to experiment with pot legalization, a move marijuana advocates hailed as historic.



headline: Naval cadet admitted a sexual encounter, investigator says
byline: By Lacey Johnson
8:31am EDT

A military investigator testified on Tuesday that a former U.S. Naval Academy football player said he had a sexual encounter with a female midshipman who has accused him and two other former players of raping her.

The men - Tra'ves Bush, 22; Eric Graham, 21; and Joshua Tate, 21 - are facing a preliminary hearing on charges of sexually assaulting the woman in April 2012 at an off-campus party in Annapolis, Maryland, the site of the elite academy. The woman has said she had passed out from drinking when the alleged assault took place.

The rape allegations are the latest in a spate of high-profile U.S. military sexual assault cases, some involving personnel whose job it was to prevent sexual abuse.

Michelle Robinson, a special agent for the Naval Criminal Investigation Service, said Graham had told her he had a sexual encounter with the woman in a car parked outside the party prior to the alleged rape.

During the September 2012 interview, Graham said he knew the midshipman had been drinking because her eyes were "glossy" and she "smelled of alcohol," said Robinson, who testified via an online link from Bahrain.

In earlier interviews with investigators, Graham had denied seeing the woman at the party, Robinson said.

13-SECOND WINDOW

Under questioning by Graham's attorney, Lieutenant Commander Angela Tang, Robinson said that in an interview less than a month after the party that the woman had said she knew something had happened there.

Last week, the woman testified she did not recall feeling like she had sex the night before. She denied having any memories of a sexual nature from the party.

Robinson said the woman told her in a September 2012 interview that she recalled "a 13-second window" of sexual activity that night.

The preliminary hearing, now in its second week, is expected to conclude on Tuesday at Washington's Navy Yard with final witnesses and closing statements.

During the so-called Article 32 hearing, the woman, now a senior, faced dozens of hours of sometimes graphic and repetitive questioning from defense attorneys about the party and its aftermath.

The presiding officer, Commander Robert Monahan, will make a recommendation to Academy Superintendent Vice Admiral Michael Miller on whether the case should go to a court martial. A decision on a court martial is expected to take one or two weeks.

The woman has testified she filed an assault report only on another student's urging, saying she had not wanted to get anybody in trouble or be forced to leave school.

The three defendants are charged with sexual assault and making false statements.

Reuters generally does not report the names of sexual assault victims.

Disclosure of the alleged incident came a week after President Barack Obama, in a speech at the Naval Academy on May 24, urged graduates to stamp out sexual assault from their ranks.

Bush's May graduation was put on hold pending the outcome of the case. Graham is a senior, and Tate is a junior.

headline: Slow pace of justice wears down Occupy Wall Street defendants
byline: By Joseph Ax
8:31am EDT

Occupy Wall Street protesters who once vowed to "occupy" the courts by challenging their arrests on minor violations have since been defeated by the slow pace of justice, with many forgoing trial.

As Occupy's two-year anniversary approaches on September 17, the movement that once captivated national attention has largely faded.

Hundreds of protesters campaigning against economic inequality set up a makeshift encampment in a downtown Manhattan park, inspiring dozens of similar sites across the country. Police eventually cleared the New York City park in a late-night raid.

More than 2,600 arrests were made in Manhattan in connection with Occupy, including 700 on the Brooklyn Bridge on October 1.

Approximately half of all defendants accepted offers from the Manhattan District Attorney's office to dismiss the charges if they avoided arrest for six months. Hundreds more took plea deals. Overall, fewer than 70 cases reached trial, less than 3 percent of the total; 53 resulted in convictions.

Sixteen cases remained as of August, according to statistics tracked by the district attorney's office.

Many defendants found it too onerous to return time and again for court dates at the overburdened New York City Criminal Court, which handles hundreds of thousands cases a year, even when they felt their arrests were illegitimate, said Martin Stolar, a National Lawyers Guild attorney who handled hundreds of cases.

"What is the best use of your time?" Stolar said he asked several clients. "Is it coming to court and fighting the case, or is it moving on and continuing to do the political work that led you to the Occupy movement in the first place?"

For nearly two years after her arrest on the Brooklyn Bridge during an Occupy Wall Street march, Karina Garcia refused to accept a plea deal.

At her ninth court appearance in June, tears came to her eyes after the judge told her to come back again in two months. Finally, the judge ruled earlier this month that prosecutors had taken too long to bring her to trial and threw out her case.

"I was like, is this really happening? Is it finally over?" said Garcia, a schoolteacher at the time of her arrest. "It's been a very punitive process."

The vast majority of arrested protesters were charged with minor infractions, such as disorderly conduct or blocking vehicular traffic.

At the time, many protesters said they would fight the charges and press for trials. Court officials designated a special courtroom, and the Manhattan District Attorney's office assigned a team of prosecutors.

Some of the few cases that still endure have lasted more than 10 times as long as the encampment did.

"It's been a much slower process than I ever imagined," said Justin Adkins, 35, who traveled several hours from Williamstown, Massachusetts, to 10 court appearances before his case was also tossed out for speedy trial violations.

FLOOD OF CASES

As Garcia, Adkins and hundreds of other protesters were getting arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge, Assistant District Attorney Nitin Savur's Blackberry began buzzing.

A week earlier, police had arrested nearly 100 people during an Occupy demonstration in Union Square, and prosecutors knew they could soon have a flood of cases.

"We started realizing, this is not going to be one or two arrests each day," said Savur, the deputy chief for the office's trial division.

Savur and other senior prosecutors decided to appoint an experienced assistant, Michele Bayer, as "protest supervisor" and assigned two assistants to handle all Occupy-related cases.

The model proved successful, Savur said, enough that the office has designated a protest supervisor for other large-scale events, such as city parades, that could result in mass arrests. Overall, judges dismissed only a handful of cases for speedy trial reasons.

Still, the Occupy cases inched along, sometimes delayed for months at a time, a pace that defense lawyers said was common at Manhattan Criminal Court.

The grind that confronts criminal defendants was a revelation for Occupy defendants, many of whom were white, first-time offenders.

"People with very little experience with the criminal justice system see how it works, and they're astounded," said Stolar, the defense lawyer.

The Occupy cases included many defendants who were initially reluctant to accept deals. In addition, cases that involve defendants in jail are given priority, pushing Occupy cases further back in line.

Occupy cases typically involved lengthy pre-trial proceedings as defense lawyers argued their clients were simply exercising their right to free expression.

"These are not your run-of-the-mill, drinking-a-beer-on-the-sidewalk cases," said Justin Barry, the chief clerk for New York City Criminal Court. "These defendants had issues they wanted to bring up with the judge, and that takes time."



headline: Cuba-to-Florida swimmer says she is 'through with the ocean'
byline: By Michael Haskins
8:31am EDT

old American woman who swam from Cuba to Florida, vowed on Tuesday to raise money for victims of terrorism and natural disasters with endurance swims in a pool, saying "I am through with the ocean."

Nyad said she would undertake long-distance swims in a portable pool to be installed in New York. She pledged to swim 48 hours on October 8-10 to raise money for people left homeless last year by Hurricane Sandy.

"No waves, no jellyfish, no seasickness," Nyad said on CNN, referring to the pool.

She also plans to take the pool to Boston to raise money for victims of the Boston Marathon bombing tied to the anniversary of the April 15 attack and later to Moore, Oklahoma, to raise money for victims of a tornado that devastated that town in May.

"This is going to be my thing for the next two years, to not forget people who have had their lives damaged so badly in natural and terrorist disasters," she told MSNBC.

Nyad hinted she may also be planning a one-woman stage show.

Nyad became the first person to swim across the Florida Straits from Cuba without a shark cage, coming ashore on Monday after covering the 110 miles in 53 hours.

She set a record for the longest ocean swim without a shark cage or flippers, according to her crew.

After four previous attempts over 35 years, Nyad credited a lack of box jellyfish, which she called the most deadly animals in the ocean, with allowing her to make it this time.

She wore a prosthetic mask to protect her from jellyfish, although it allowed sea water into her mouth and created sores.

Her first night in the water after departing from the Cuban capital of Havana on Saturday was "hell on earth," she told a press conference on Tuesday in Key West.

She swallowed "tremendous volumes of sea water" and was vomiting constantly, she said.

But on Sunday, Nyad said she got a big emotional boost when her crew members said she would soon benefit from a strong current flowing north toward Key West.

Still, the swim quickly began to take its toll. "I was in a state of delusion on Sunday night. I was seeing the Taj Mahal."

At times, Nyad said she sang songs to keep her mental strength. "I've got this song list in my brain of 85 songs," she said. "Neil Young is a favorite."

She also stayed focused by counting in French, Spanish and German and going over in her mind book she recently read.

Nyad said she got another lift as she closed in on Key West and saw a large crowd gathered at the beach to greet her.

Her record-setting swim drew intense attention on social media, with people sending Twitter and Facebook messages congratulating her, including U.S. President Barack Obama.

In one tweet, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton congratulated Nyad. "Flying to 112 counties is a lot until you consider swimming between 2," it read. "Feels like I swim with sharks - but you actually did it!"

Nyad offered inspiration to the post-World War Two Baby boomer generation.

"The truth is I don't wake thinking about age or that I am a woman, a gay woman or 64 years old. I think I am in the prime of my life. I'm a Baby Boomer and I'm just coming into my own."

headline: Record-breaking San Francisco Bay bridge opens after delays

anchored suspension bridge in the world opened across San Francisco Bay late Monday night, six years behind schedule and five times over budget, police said.

The new $6 billion eastern section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, one of the busiest spans in the United States, opened in time to accommodate Tuesday's 280,000 daily commuters, San Francisco police said on Tuesday.

The San Francisco-to-Oakland bridge was shut to traffic last Wednesday to complete construction and build connections from the new eastern stretch to the existing toll plaza and the bay's Yerba Buena Island.

The single-towered, 2,047-foot-long (634-metre) self-anchored main span is more than twice the length of the previous record holders, Japan's Konohana Bridge and South Korea's Yeongjong Grand Bridge, according to the Structurae engineering database.

A self-anchored suspension bridge has its main cables fixed to its deck. A traditional suspension bridge is anchored to the ground.

The opening follows years of delays prompted by design disputes, financial struggles and safety issues. It also comes two decades after its predecessor partly collapsed in a 1989 earthquake.

In March, a survey found that 32 of more than 2,300 steel rods used to help the 2.2-mile (3.5-km) eastern span of the bridge withstand earthquakes were broken.

The cost of the retrofitting was estimated between $5 million and $10 million. Placeholder plate stabilizers are being used to keep the bridge open before the rods are permanently replaced in December.

The bridge will feature a single 525-foot (160-metre) tower and a bicycle path, points of contention when the bridge was being planned.

Once the new stretch is opened, it will take about three years to demolish the old span, bridge officials said in a statement.

The eastern section of the bridge reaches from Yerba Buena Island to Oakland. The western stretch links downtown San Francisco to the island.

The east span will include east- and westbound traffic on side-by-side decks. The west span will continue to have decks placed above and below one another.

headline: Firefighters gain an edge on wildfire in Yosemite National Park
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

Firefighters in California gained ground on Monday against a massive wildfire burning part of Yosemite National Park, although complete containment may be weeks away, officials said.

Crews working through the night got an edge on the so-called Rim Fire, a 350-square mile (906-square km) blaze that has charred the California park's Northwest, said Andrea Capps, spokeswoman for the Rim Fire command center.

They connected containment lines near the fire's northwestern and western borders, where most of the 4,500 homes threatened by the blaze are located, she said.

The fire was 60 percent contained by early Monday, a 15 percent increase from the night before.

"Last night is when it all really tied together," Capps said. "It's looking really good over there right now. They're calling that containment line secure."

Despite the jump in containment, Capps said fire analysts estimate that it could take until September 20 to contain the Rim Fire fully. Steep terrain and high, unpredictable winds will likely pose the main challenges in digging and burning containment lines around the blaze.

"The majority of the containment lines will probably be really strong by the middle, end of this week, but they just want to give themselves enough time to make sure it's fully contained," Capps said.

Wet weather expected in the area on Monday raised hopes, but the possibility of thunderstorms kept officials wary.

"Rain is good, but the winds that come with the pressure changes with the thunderstorms could lead to some unpredictable (fire) behavior," Capps said. "We have had a few sprinkles this morning, and so we're all waiting to see what happens."

While the majority of the fire was burning on Stanislaus National Forest, 60,214 acres, or about 27 percent, of the fire has crossed the Yosemite National Park border.

The massive blaze has scorched an area larger than many U.S. cities and is the fourth-largest on record in California, burning more than 220,000 acres over the past two weeks.

Over the past several years, wildfires in the U.S. West have become increasingly frequent and at times deadly. Earlier this year, 19 firefighters were killed in a blaze in Arizona, and wildfires have raged in several states, including Nevada, Alaska and New Mexico.



headline: Obama and aides confront skeptical Congress on Syria strike

weary American public.

Obama made a series of calls to members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with more scheduled for Monday, underscoring the task confronting the administration before it can go ahead with using force in response to a deadly chemical attack blamed on the Syrian government.

Dozens of lawmakers, some in tennis shirts or shirtsleeves, cut short their vacations and streamed into the corridors of the Capitol building for a Sunday afternoon intelligence briefing on Syria with Obama's national security team.

When they emerged nearly three hours later, there was no immediate sign that the many skeptics in Congress had changed their minds.

"I am very concerned about taking America into another war against a country that hasn't attacked us," said Representative Janice Hahn, a California Democrat. On the way out of the briefing, she said the participants appeared "evenly divided" on whether to give Obama approval.

None expressed doubts that Syria had engaged in chemical warfare. "The searing image of babies lined up dead, that's what I can't get out of my mind right now," Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz said after the closed-door briefing.

But the credibility of the administration's intelligence is turning out to be a less important issue than the nature and usefulness of the response.

Earlier in the day, Secretary of State John Kerry invoked the crimes of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein and warned of a potential threat to Israel a day after Obama's decision to delay an imminent attack on Syrian targets and allow Congress to vote on it first.

Even as Kerry took to the airwaves touting new evidence that deadly sarin gas was used in the August 21 chemical attack near Damascus, the scope of the challenge confronting the administration became apparent.

Lawmakers raised a broad array of concerns, including the potential effectiveness of limited strikes, the possible unintended consequence of dragging the United States into another open-ended Middle East conflict, the wisdom of acting without broader international backing to share the burden and the war fatigue of the American public.

Many in Congress have been able to avoid taking a position on the merits of a military strike, focusing instead on demands that Obama consult them and seek their approval.

While Kerry predicted Obama would win the endorsement he wants, a growing cacophony of congressional critics - ranging from liberal Democratic doves to Republican Tea Party conservatives - illustrated just how hard that will be.

At the same time, Kerry, the administration's most impassioned voice for intervention in Syria's 2-1/2-year civil war, was left to publicly defend Obama's stunning reversal, a decision that puts any strike on hold for at least nine days.

"This is squarely now in the hands of Congress," Kerry told CNN, saying he had confidence "they will do what is right because they understand the stakes."

In a round of television appearances, Kerry declined to say whether Obama would go ahead with military action if Congress rejects the president's request, as Britain's parliament did last week to derail London's role in any Syria military operation.

But, echoing Obama's comments in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, he insisted the president had the right to act on his own if he chooses that course.

Obama is taking a gamble by putting the brakes on the military assault that he considers essential to maintain U.S. credibility after Assad crossed the "red line" set against the use of chemical weapons.

MORE EVIDENCE

The consensus on Capitol Hill is that Obama has a good chance of winning approval in the Democratic-led Senate, but the vote appears too close to call in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where the president's opponents rarely miss an opportunity to block him.

Acknowledging that the administration has its work cut out for it to persuade some lawmakers, Kerry insisted they could not "have it both ways" by demanding a voice in the matter and then abdicating responsibility to uphold the international bans on chemical weapons use.

Kerry used the television appearances to provide further evidence backing accusations against the Syrian government.

"I can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin," Kerry told CNN's "State of the Union."

It was the first time the administration had pinpointed what kind of chemical was used in the attack on a rebel-held area, which U.S. intelligence agencies said killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children.

"So this case is building and this case will build," Kerry told NBC's "Face the Nation."

OBAMA'S DILEMMA

Obama's efforts are sure to be hampered by his dismal relations with congressional Republicans. Another bitter face-off on government spending is looming this autumn.

Lawmakers for the most part welcomed Obama's decision to consult them, but looked in no hurry to reconvene early from their summer recess, which lasts until September 9.

Comments from leading Republicans and Democrats indicated how complex the debate will be - and raised doubts whether Obama would win their authorization.

Underscoring a sense of wariness even from Obama's traditional allies, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said the Vermont Democrat believes that the use-of-force resolution offered by the White House is too broad and that new language will be written for consideration.

Mike Rogers, Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN: "I think there are some real challenges. I think that at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion. This is a national security issue."

Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, speaking on NBC, took a more skeptical view.

While saying he was "proud" of Obama for coming to Congress for authority, Paul said, "It's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down the involvement in the Syrian war."

"I think the Senate will rubber stamp what he wants," he said. "The House will be a much closer vote." The Senate is controlled by Obama's Democratic Party, the House is in the hands of the Republican Party.

Republican Senator John McCain said he was not sure Obama's request would pass, but made clear his view that tougher military action was needed than the limited cruise missile strikes that the Obama administration is preparing.

Republican Representative Peter King of New York said it was unclear if lawmakers would sign off on an attack on Syria, but he warned Obama may have to overcome "the isolationist wing" of the Republican Party to prevail.

Seeking to lay the groundwork for what is expected to be a heated congressional debate, Kerry tipped his hand on one tactic the administration will use - linking the congressional vote to safeguarding U.S. ally Israel from the Syrian chemical weapons threat.

"I don't think they will want to vote, ultimately, to put Israel at risk," Kerry said.

Lawmakers of both major political parties recognize how important it is to be seen as defenders of Israel, especially at election time, when they compete to show voters who is a better friend of the Jewish state.



headline: Limits put on how long U.S. Naval midshipman in rape case must testify
byline: By Lacey Johnson
8:31am EDT

The military officer presiding at a hearing on accusations by a U.S. Naval Academy midshipman that she was raped by three academy football players agreed on Sunday to limit the amount of testimony she must give, after her lawyers complained she was exhausted.

The female midshipman said she was sexually assaulted in April 2012 while she was blacked out after drinking too much at an off-campus "football house" party in Annapolis, Maryland, site of the elite academy. Tra'ves Bush, 22; Eric Graham, 21; and Joshua Tate, 21, have been charged.

The ruling on her testimony came at a so-called Article 32 hearing to determine if the men should be court-martialed.

The woman in this case, now a Naval Academy senior, had been questioned, with periodic breaks, by defense attorneys for more than 20 hours since Wednesday afternoon, with one hearing lasting more than 12 hours.

Lawyers for the woman said she could not give clear and accurate testimony because she was so exhausted by the long hours spent on the witness stand.

On Sunday, the investigating officer presiding over the hearing, Commander Robert Monahan, granted a request to limit her time on the stand to between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., or essentially to no more than nine hours a day.

She will also be entitled to take breaks from the testimony at least every 90 minutes.

The woman, who was a 20-year-old sophomore at the time of the alleged incident, was initially uncooperative with investigators. In explanation, she said she did not want to get anyone in trouble and that she feared her mother would force her to leave the school.

Reuters generally does not report the names of sexual assault victims.

During cross examination of the woman on Sunday a lawyer for Tate argued that the woman was not sufficiently afraid of Tate considering the allegations because the summer after the alleged rape, she got on a boat at a party where Tate was present. She went inside the boat with him and had a conversation with him.

"Would it be fair to say you weren't intimidated by Josh Tate at his point in time?" the lawyer, Jason Ehrenburg, asked. She responded: "I felt ... I had no reason to be intimidated at that specific instance."

She was also questioned at length on Sunday by Graham's attorney, Lieutenant Commander Angela Tang, as to whether she deleted her Twitter account to hide potential evidence from investigators - an allegation she denied.

The woman said she filed an assault report at the urging of a fellow student and volunteered to accept punishment for underage drinking. She sought legal help in early 2013.

Bush, Graham and Tate, none of them any longer on the school's football team, are also charged with making false statements. Bush's graduation in May was put on hold pending the outcome of the case. Graham is a senior, and Tate is a junior.

President Barack Obama's efforts to convince Congress to back his plan to attack Syria met with skepticism on Monday from lawmakers in his own Democratic Party who expressed concern the United States would be dragged into a new Middle East conflict.

Obama appeared to make some headway, however, with two influential Republican senators, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who came out of a White House meeting with him convinced that the president is willing to do more than simply fire off cruise missiles and also wants to bolster the Syrian opposition.

McCain, long an advocate of a more robust U.S. approach to Syria, said failure to get behind strikes against President Bashar al-Assad would be "catastrophic."

Obama's abrupt decision to halt plans for a strike against Assad's forces and instead wait for congressional approval has generated a raging debate just as the president prepares to go to Sweden and Russia this week.

Armed with evidence they say proves Syria's government killed over 1,400 people with nerve agent sarin, Obama's top national security aides made their case to Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives in a 70-minute conference call, urging them to back Obama's request.

The White House argument is that Syria must be punished for the August 21 chemical weapons onslaught and that at stake is the integrity of an international ban on such weapons and the need to safeguard U.S. national security interests and allies Israel, Jordan and Turkey.

Syria has blamed the attack on rebel forces.

As with much in which the divided Congress involves itself, there was deep disagreement on how to proceed, with some lawmakers worried the United States might be drawn into yet another Middle Eastern conflict in spite of Obama's pledges for a limited strike.

Overshadowing the debate are the ghosts of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, conflicts that lasted far longer and were far more expensive than first predicted. Congressional hesitancy reflects the overall weariness of war among Americans, who oppose getting involved in Syria.

Representative Chris Van Hollen, a senior Democrat and an ally of Obama on many issues, complained that the wording of the White House's request to Congress for the authorization of the use of force was too open-ended and could lead to deep U.S. involvement in Syria, where more than 100,000 people have died in more than two years of conflict.

"There is no limitation on putting American soldiers on the ground. There is no end point" on the resolution, he said. "The draft resolution presented by the administration is overly broad, it provides too much of a blank check to the executive," he said.

Van Hollen was among Democratic lawmakers briefed by conference call by Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, national security adviser Susan Rice, intelligence director James Clapper and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

OPPOSITION IN BOTH PARTIES

Obama needs to shore up his left wing, particularly in the House, where liberal Democrats and many conservative "Tea Party" Republicans are both opposed to more U.S. military action in the Middle East.

McCain and Graham are from the more traditional wing of the Republican Party that generally favors U.S. intervention abroad when deemed necessary. They want a broad strategy not just to punish Assad for the chemical weapons attack but to help Syria's rebels.

The Democratic-led Senate is expected to approve U.S. military action, but failing to win the support of McCain and Graham would be a blow to Obama's wider influence over Congress on Syria.

"I guess the way I would term the conversation is that there is a consensus being formed that we need to degrade Assad's capabilities and upgrade the Syrian opposition," Graham told reporters when he and McCain emerged from a one-hour White House meeting with Obama.

Representative James McGovern, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, said he was skeptical that Obama's plan for military strikes could help end the war in Syria. If the vote were taken today, he would vote no.

"People are horrified by the pictures of people suffering and they genuinely want to help. But people have become, it's more than just war-weary, they've become skeptical of the effectiveness of these military involvements," he said.

With Navy ships in place and ready to launch cruise missiles on Obama's order, no decision was likely until days after Congress returns from its summer recess on September 9. In the interim, Obama is using the time to build his case.

Washington's hesitancy has prompted mocking comments from Syrian leaders and a push from Assad's chief backer, Russia, to send members of the Russian parliament to the U.S. capital to argue against a strike.

Obama's gamble to seek congressional backing carries many risks, chief among them is that Congress will again thwart him and make him look weak around the world.

It may depend on building a majority House vote based on Obama's fellow Democrats joining those Republicans who support action, a senior House Republican aide told Reuters on Sunday.

"It's too early to speculate" what the House will do, the aide said, "but (House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi) is going to have to post a big number" among her members in support of it. The aide declined to predict how big.

Republicans hold the House, 233-200, with two vacancies.

headline: USS Nimitz carrier group sails into Red Sea in 'prudent' move
byline: By Andrea Shalal-Esa
8:31am EDT

The USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and four other ships in its strike group moved into the Red Sea early on Monday, U.S. defense officials said, describing the move as "prudent planning" in case the ships are needed for military action against Syria.

The officials said the Nimitz entered the Red Sea around 6 a.m. EDT (1000 GMT), but the strike group had not received any orders to move into the Mediterranean, where five U.S. destroyers and an amphibious ship, the USS San Antonio, remain poised for possible cruise missile strikes against Syria.

Moving the Nimitz into the Red Sea was aimed at putting more U.S. assets in place if they are needed to support what U.S. officials still describe as a limited attack against Syria after it used chemical weapons against civilians.

"It does place that strike group in a position to respond to a variety of contingencies," said one official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.

The nuclear-powered Nimitz is accompanied by the Princeton, a cruiser, and three destroyers - the William P. Lawrence, Stockdale and Shoup, according to the officials.

They said there had been no change regarding six U.S. Navy ships now in the eastern Mediterranean, but military planners were reassessing the situation given a delay in the cruise missile strikes that had been expected this past weekend.

President Barack Obama on Saturday backed off imminent strikes by the destroyers off the coast of Syria until Congress had time to vote its approval. Defense officials said the delay gave them more time to reassess which ships and other weapons will be kept in the region - and whether some may be allowed to leave. Congress returns to Washington September 9.

The U.S. Navy doubled its presence in the eastern Mediterranean in the past week, effectively adding two destroyers to the three that generally patrol the region, and diverting the San Antonio, which carries four massive CH-53 helicopters and 300 Marines, from another mission.

Two of the destroyers were due to be relieved but are now serving along with the ships that were to replace them.

PRUDENT DEPLOYMENT

It was not immediately clear how long those ships would be asked to remain in the eastern Mediterranean, but officials suggested that changes could be made to the current fleet there in coming days.

The destroyers are carrying a combined load of about 200 Tomahawk missiles, but officials say a limited strike on Syria could be accomplished with half that number.

Retired Admiral Gary Roughead, who served as chief of naval operations during the 2011 strikes on Libya, said the Navy's decision to move the carrier into the Red Sea meant it was closer to the "points of tension."

"It's a prudent move that provides for maximum naval flexibility in the region," Roughead, who is now a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, told Reuters. "It is not unusual to move carriers around in North Arabian Sea and Red Sea as events dictate."

Reuters reported Sunday that officials had rerouted the Nimitz carrier group, which was due to sail east around Asia to return to its home port in Everett, Washington, after being relieved in recent days by another aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman.

Officials said the USS Kearsarge, a large-deck amphibious ship, remained in North Arabian Sea, and there were no plans to move the ship into the Red Sea.

The Kearsarge, which carries 6 AV-8B Harriers, 10-12 V-22 Ospreys and helicopters, played a key role in the 2011 strikes on Libya. Two Ospreys launched from the ship helped rescue a downed F-15 pilot during that operation.

century ago are believed to have been secretly buried.

"We have found evidence of burial hardware - hinges on coffins," said Dr. Christian Wells, an anthropologist from the University of South Florida, in a briefing about a mile from the closed excavation site near the former Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys.

"There appear to be a few pieces associated with burial shrouds, and there are pins consistent with the 1920s and 1930s, - based on the style of the pins - and they appear to be brass," he said.

Some "large-bone fragments" were found on the first day of digging, Wells said. They were human bones, he added, but it was impossible to know if they came from any of the teenaged boys who were housed at Dozier during its infamous 111-year existence. The school was closed in mid-2011.

The bones will be examined in laboratories at the University of South Florida and the University of North Texas, as part of a program funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and state of Florida.

After forensic investigators, using ground-piercing radar and old public records, detected 31 spots showing possible human remains, researchers planted crude white crosses on a nearby hillside to commemorate the unaccounted-for boys.

Some former residents of Dozier, now in their 60s and 70s, have told of brutal beatings and boys - mostly black juveniles - disappearing without explanation more than 50 years ago. Blood relatives of some of the boys have given DNA samples, to be matched against evidence taken from the skeletal remains.

Earlier on Saturday, Dr. Erin Kimmerle, a forensic anthropologist from USF, met with some family members and survivors.

"We're approaching it much like you would an archeological excavation," Kimmerle said. "It's all done carefully and by hand."

'NEVER HAD A CHANCE'

Tananarive Due, who came to the dig with some family members, said her great-uncle, Robert Stephens, died at the school in 1937.

"The story was ... he tried to run away at one point," she said. "The official cause of death was a stabbing by another inmate, that's what it was listed as. But with so many of these boys, who knows how they died? Their families never had a chance to say 'good-bye' to their loved ones."

Johnny Lee Gaddy, 67, said he was locked up from 1957 to 1961 for truancy. He said he was severely beaten, but in his teens became a good farm worker, hoping to get released.

Gaddy said he had heard of teens disappearing without explanation.

"I know some they said went home, but they hadn't been here long enough to go home," said Gaddy. "They said some others ran away or were transferred to other places. We never saw any bodies or funerals."

John Due, father of Tananarive, said descendants and civil-rights activists who pressed the state for disclosure of what happened to the young men ran into rigid resistance from authorities for decades.

"People didn't want to talk about it, and we found that particularly among black families," he said. "That's what racism does. It beats you down and you think you don't matter, so you won't speak up."

The forensic teams will work through Tuesday. Remains that can be identified will be re-interred at family plots and any unidentified remains will be numbered and buried - with records kept for later return to families, if any come forward.



headline: Obama will hold off on Syria strike until Congress has its say
byline: By Roberta Rampton and Jeff Mason
8:31am EDT

President Barack Obama on Saturday backed away from an imminent military strike against Syria to seek the approval of the U.S. Congress, in a decision that likely delays U.S. action for at least 10 days.

Obama, in a stern statement from the White House Rose Garden, said he had authorized the use of military force to punish Syria for a chemical weapons attack August 21 that U.S. officials say killed 1,429 people. Military assets to carry out a strike are in place and ready to move on his order, he said.

But in an acknowledgement of protests from U.S. lawmakers and concerns from war-weary Americans, Obama added an important caveat: he wants Congress to approve.

"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual," he said.

Congress is in recess and not scheduled to return to work until September 9. It is unclear which way any vote would go.

"Today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move as one nation," Obama said.

Obama's decision was a high-stakes gamble that he can gain approval from Congress for a limited strike against Syria to safeguard an international ban on chemical weapons usage, defend U.S. national security interests and protect regional allies like Turkey, Jordan and Israel.

"I have long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in our example as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people," Obama said.

His decision was also a significant shift away from what was perceived to be preparations for a speedy strike against Syrian targets. He had made clear he was prepared to act unilaterally after the British parliament refused to go along with American plans.

Protracted and expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have left Americans reluctant to get involved in Middle Eastern conflicts.

Most Americans do not want the United States to intervene in Syria. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken this week showed only 20 percent believe the United States should take action, but that was up from 9 percent last week.

DEBATE IN WASHINGTON

A debate has raged for days among members of the U.S. Congress over whether, or how quickly, Obama should take action.

House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top U.S. Republican, welcomed the move, which he said is a response to "serious, substantive questions" being raised about the ability of the president to launch a military move on his own.

"In consultation with the president, we expect the House to consider a measure the week of September 9. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people," he said.

Obama, who only on Friday had said nobody was more war-weary than he is, has nonetheless been appalled by searing video images of Syrians who fell under the chemical weapons onslaught.

In his Saturday speech, he left no doubt that he feels action must be taken and is confident that a strike would deter this kind of behavior and degrade Syria's ability to carry out similar attacks.

But his decision may well lead to criticism that he conceivably is stepping away again from a "red line" he established against Syrian use of chemical weapons.

"President Obama is abdicating his responsibility as commander in chief and undermining the authority of future presidents. The president does not need Congress to authorize a strike on Syria," said Republican Representative Peter King.

Obama's decision was announced after he met his national security team at the White House. Top aides were to brief senators later in the day and members of the House of Representatives are to receive a classified briefing from administration officials on Sunday.

The objective is to show the intelligence U.S. officials say is solid proof that the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad launched a large chemical weapons assault in Damascus suburbs that left among the dead 426 children.

Obama has broad legal powers to take military action, and he insisted he felt he had the authority to launch a strike on his own. Now, he has to launch a major effort to convince Congress.

"Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?" he said.



headline: Failure to thin brush may have worsened California wildfire
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

thinning projects approved by forestry officials but never funded might have slowed the progress of the massive Rim Fire in California, a wide range of critics said this weekend.

The massive blaze at the edge of Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountains has scorched an area larger than many U.S. cities - with some of that land in the very location pinpointed by the U.S. Forest service for eight projects aimed at clearing and burning brush and small trees that help fuel wildfire.

The projects, which were approved by the U.S. Forest Service but never funded by Congress, would have thinned the woods in about 25 square miles (65 square km) in the Groveland District of the Stanislaus National Forest, much of which was incinerated by the Rim Fire.

About 9,000 acres were suitable to be deliberately burned as fire prevention buffer zones in 2012, the Forest Service said in a document provided to Reuters.

But reductions in funding for fire prevention efforts by Congress in recent years coupled with stringent air quality standards that limit the timeframe for such burns have hampered efforts to carry them out on a larger scale.

Last year, the Forest Service had funding to burn 449 acres in the Groveland District but did not reach that target, said District Ranger Maggie Dowd.

The wildfire is the sixth-largest on record in California. It burned over 220,000 acres over the past two weeks while penetrating Yosemite National Park and threatening to befoul the Hetch Hetchy reservoir providing the lion's share of water to San Francisco.

"This is a colossal unfunded backlog of critically important fuel reduction work," said John Buckley, executive director of the Central Sierra Environmental Resource Center and a former Forest Service fire fighter. The projects "would have inarguably made the Rim Fire far easier to contain, far less expensive and possibly not even a major disaster."

Over the past several years, wildfires in the U.S. West have become increasingly frequent and at times deadly. Earlier this year, 19 firefighters were killed in a blaze in Arizona, and wildfires have raged in several states, including Nevada, Alaska and New Mexico.

MORE ACTIVE WILDFIRES

Federal fire figures show an average of 7.6 million acres (3.1 million hectares) charred per year between 2004 and 2012, up from 3.6 million acres (1.46 million hectares) annually in the preceding 20 years.

Part of the problem, experts and many fire officials say, is that funding has been low for the controlled burns and forest-thinning work that makes it harder for a wildfire to spread.

In recent years, Jarvis said, the trend has been to shift money from fire prevention to firefighting.

"We've got to invest up front in terms of controlling and managing these fires," said Jonathan Jarvis, director of the National Park Service from his smoke-filled post in Yosemite National Park. "Just waiting for the big fire and then throwing everything you've got at it makes no sense."

The massive blazes are fueled by high temperatures, said U.S. Forest Service geographer Carl Skinner.

Mike Albrecht, co-owner of the logging company Sierra Resource Management, which operates on public land in the Sierra Nevada mountains said that the backlogged projects would likely have helped limit the Rim Fire.

The "one-two punch" of thinning the forest through logging and prescribed burns is essential for stemming the tide of catastrophic wildfires across the American West, he said.

Craig Thomas, conservation director for the environmental coalition group Sierra Forest Legacy, said such a course would help reduce the intensity of wildfires enough to spare the largest trees, while clearing space and providing nutrients for grasses and wildflowers.

In addition to perennial funding shortfalls for prevention efforts, Thomas faults federal and state air quality regimes that limit the timeframe for prescribed burns by counting the smoke they generate along with industrial and auto emissions - while not counting the smoke from an actual wildfire.

There is also skepticism over the relative importance of planned burning among some lawmakers, including Congressman Tom McClintock, a third-term conservative Republican in whose district the Rim Fire has burned.

More dire than a backlog of Forest Service controlled burns, McClintock says, is the precipitous, 25-year decline in logging of bigger, money-making trees on public lands.

"If we were harvesting the same amount of timber we once did, we'd have fewer fires but also a revenue stream for the treatment of many thousands of acres (hectares) that we're not treating today," he said.

Dowd, the Forest Service Ranger, said that with containment lines built around less than half of the still-burning Rim Fire, it is too early to know how much the prevention projects might have helped.

But she said that the several dozen acres of prescribed burns carried out in her district over the past two years, are insufficient.

"It's not enough," Dowd said.

pound (41.9 kg) specimen named "Bob" to officials at the state fair.

Keevan Dinkel of Wasilla, Alaska, produced this year's winning entry, which was carried in by several Boy Scouts, in the Alaska State Fair's Giant Cabbage Weigh-Off on Friday night.

His giant cabbage, which rose to about thigh height on a typical adult, and those of other contestants were weighed at the fairgrounds in Palmer, in a contest watched by hundreds of onlookers, attended by green-clad women dressed as "cabbage fairies" and monitored by a representative of the state Division of Weights and Measures.

Produce can grow to enormous sizes under Alaska's summer midnight sun. Growing big cabbages is a tradition in this part of the state, just north of Anchorage, which is considered Alaska's main farm belt.

This year was the first time in the contest's 18 years that a child has won the weigh-off, according to state fair officials. The fair offers a junior competition for growers 12 and younger, but Keevan's entry was put into the adult open category because of its size.

Keevan, whose family operates a local farm, took home $2,000 for his prize-winner.

Keevan's "Bob" fell short of the world-record 138.3-pound (62.7-kg) cabbage, called the "Palmer Pachyderm," grown last year by Palmer greenhouse owner Scott Robb.

While the unusually hot and sunny summer was good for many crops, that was not the case for the traditional green cabbages, said growers attending Friday's fair weigh-in.

"Cabbages are a cold crop. They like their roots warm and their heads cool," said Mardie Robb, Scott Robb's wife.

Alaska's giant vegetables also face hazards, including marauding moose that are fond of poaching would-be winners while they are growing in gardens, and flaws that might develop during growing can knock them out of contention.

This year, a potential state-champion pumpkin, a 1,289-pound (584.6 kg) specimen named "Time Bandit" and grown by J.D. Megchelsen of Nikiski, was disqualified because of a hole, violating rules calling for vegetables to be structurally intact. Absent the hole, it would have just beaten the Alaska pumpkin record of 1,287 pounds (583.8 kg) that Megchelsen set in 2011. Instead, this year's blue ribbon went to a 1,182-pound (536.1 kg) pumpkin named "Eva" that was grown in Anchorage.

Davidson Co, but few traveled as far as Chai Chua.

The 46-year-old business owner bid farewell to his wife and three children in Brunei about a week ago and set off with seven of his closest friends. They flew to Los Angeles, then hopped on rented Harley-Davidson motorcycles and headed to the Midwestern state.

"My wife knows I am crazy about this," said Chua, after arriving at the site of the party, where he and his friends joined the crowds marking the motorcycle maker's anniversary over the Labor Day weekend.

"We have seen the prairies, the mountains, Mount Rushmore and now the Mecca for riders," Chua said, shouting over blues music outside of the Harley-Davidson Museum where revelers kicked off the celebration with a bike rally on Thursday.

Nearby, a long procession of the motorcycles, nicknamed "hogs," rumbled onto the museum campus, where riders parked their bikes in tight rows creating a glistening sea of shiny steel.

Riders donned black leather, as well as an assortment of denim, bandanas and Harley-Davidson orange, as they snapped photos, drank beer and marveled at the spectacle.

"It's exciting ... . (There's) a lot of personal satisfaction in doing it," said Fernando Dorantes, 52, an engineer from Toluca, Mexico, where he and seven of his friends began their five-day, 2,600-mile (4,200-km) journey to Milwaukee.

The party spread across several sites in the city, including the SummerFest grounds where bands including ZZ Top, Blue Oyster Cult and the Doobie Brothers performed.

"It doesn't matter what you are or what you look like. As long as you ride, it's a brotherhood," said Bobby Hite, 40, of Culver, Indiana, after getting a 110th anniversary tattoo on his left bicep. "You got the cackle, the rumble between your legs."

Harley-Davidson has long relied on a white, male and middle-aged consumer base, an approach reflected in the makeup of the Milwaukee crowd.

But in recent years, it has begun to try to design motorcycles that appeal to younger riders, women and minorities.

The celebration focused on the evolution of the bike during the past century, with guests going on tours of the Harley plant, a few miles from where William Harley and Arthur Davidson began making them in a shed in 1903.

"This is where it all began. Harley Davidson is my life. Besides my kids, it is my life," said Terry Martin, 59, of Boston, as he sat on his motorcycle next to a replica of the shed at the company's headquarters.

The celebration comes weeks after rival Polaris Industries relaunched the Indian motorcycle, a storied U.S. brand two years older than Harley-Davidson, at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, hallowed ground for legions of Harley-Davidson enthusiasts who flock to South Dakota each year.

But on this weekend in Milwaukee, it is all about the hog and its colorful array of devoted riders who crave the open road.

"It's freedom," said Drew Canon, a 45-year-old Texan with a short gray beard and tattooed arms. "You feel all of your senses. You smell it all, you hear it all."

sex marriage in a posting on Facebook.

Liz Cheney, who is seeking a Senate seat in Wyoming, said on Friday that she was "not pro-gay marriage."

"For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage," Mary Cheney wrote on Facebook, according to the New York Times.

"Freedom means freedom for everyone," she wrote, repeating a phrase once used by her father when he was asked about gay marriage. "That means all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other."

Both Mary Cheney and Liz Cheney could not be reached on Sunday for comment.

Liz Cheney on Friday clarified her position on same-sex marriage in response to what she said was a "dishonest push poll" in which callers were asked whether they were aware that she supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage.

"I am strongly pro-life and I am not pro-gay marriage," Liz Cheney said in her statement on Friday. "I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves."

Mary Cheney responded by saying that the issue was "not something to be decided by a show of hands."

Dick Cheney, who served as vice president under President George W. Bush, has long indicated he was supportive of gay marriage, saying that "people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into." But he has said states should regulate the matter, not the federal government.

Same-sex marriage is a divisive issue for Republicans. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in the spring found that a slim majority of Republican or Republican-leaning independents under age 50 supported gay marriage. In July, the Republican National Committee's chairman, Reince Priebus, reiterated the party's stand that marriage was between one man and one woman.



headline: For Wyoming town of one, rebirth as a hub for Vietnamese coffee
byline: By Laura Zuckerman
8:31am EDT

open this week as a hub for the sale of coffee distributed by its new Vietnamese owner.

In an on-site and Internet auction in April 2012, Nguyen Dinh Pham, 38, offered a winning bid of $900,000 for the town, billed by auction organizers as the nation's smallest, at just over 10 acres.

The high-elevation hamlet - 8,000 feet above sea level on Interstate 80 in southeastern Wyoming - came complete with a convenience store, gas station and modular home, as well as its own ZIP code.

It sprang to life in the 1860s as a military fort to guard the building of the transcontinental railroad and sported a population of as much as 2,000 in the decades that followed.

Buford - recognized as a town by the U.S. Postal Service and Wyoming's Department of Transportation - was sought by bidders from 46 countries during the auction, streamed live over the Internet.

Pham, an importer from Ho Chi Minh City, bought Buford from its single resident, Don Sammons, to fulfill a dream of land ownership and business independence, and his trip to attend the auction in person was his first to the United States

"I thought Buford was very amazing and very exciting," Pham said. "After I purchased it, I kept thinking about what to do with the town."

This past March, Pham and an associate, Tuan Do, created a company, PhinDeli Corp, to produce and sell Vietnamese coffee and to establish the brand in Buford.

PhinDeli roughly translates as "delicious filter coffee," WyomingNews.com reported on Sunday, citing a U.S. marketing representative retained by Pham. In Vietnam, coffee is typically brewed using a metal filter.

SINGLE RESIDENT

The coffee will be shipped from Vietnam to Buford, where it will be available to buy but also distributed to warehouses in the United States and sold through Amazon.com, Pham and Do said.

Pham has hired Sammons, a 63-year-old Vietnam War veteran, to oversee the operation from his nearby base in Loveland, Colorado, and has named him co-mayor.

For Sammons, the re-opening ceremony, planned for Tuesday in Buford, is a reassuring sign a town he ran for more than two decades will continue on.

"The world came to Buford," he said of international tourists who stopped for gas and snacks at the town, on I-80, a 2,900-mile highway between New York City and San Francisco. "Now, Buford will go to the world."

Sammons and his wife moved from Los Angeles to a ranch near Buford in 1980 seeking a rural lifestyle. The couple arrived in the conservative ranching community in a lipstick red Lincoln Continental that was ill-suited to the area's deep snows and high winds, and people in the area believed the transplants would soon move out.

"They gave us six months," Sammons said.

Sammons, after selling Buford last year, thought he had said his last goodbye to the place, where his wife died in 1986. But when Pham invited him earlier this year to take part in the venture, he signed on.

Betty Schroll, 93, who splits her time between Cheyenne, the state capital, and a cabin near Buford and whose ancestors settled the area, said she can remember her father taking her to Buford in the family's 1920 Dodge.

"I used to go there for an ice cream cone; now I'll go for coffee," she said.



headline: California wildfire threatening Yosemite is now size of Dallas
byline: By Jonathan Allen
8:31am EDT

A massive wildfire that has charred the northwestern edge of California's Yosemite National Park is heading towards two groves of the park's famed sequoia trees, National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis said as firefighters battled the blaze on Saturday.

The so-called Rim Fire, which now has an overall footprint that exceeds the area of Dallas, has burned about six percent of Yosemite's wilder backcountry but the vast majority of the park was still unaffected, Jarvis said.

The sequoias are expected to survive if the fire spreads through the groves of the towering redwoods that are among the park's most famous features, Jarvis said in a telephone interview.

"This is not a catastrophe for Yosemite National Park," he said in a telephone interview after surveying the affected areas. "These trees are very old and it's not the first fire they've ever seen."

Firefighters have been carrying out controlled burnings at night around the groves to clear away debris from the forest floor that could otherwise fuel a fire to such an intensity that it dangerously licks at the trees' crowns.

Lower-intensity fires, on the other hand, play a vital role in the reproductive cycle of the tough-barked sequoia, many of which bear the scars of past wildfires, by releasing the seeds from their cones and clearing the soil in which they germinate.

The so-called Rim Fire has continued to spread, having now consumed nearly 220,000 acres by Saturday, according to a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. Most of the damage is in the Stanislaus National Forest that spreads out from Yosemite's western edge.

Firefighters have contained about a third of that area.

"We're very, very cautious about the potential today," Timothy Evans, the spokesman, said. "Yesterday was very hot, there was some wind, and the same was somewhat predicted for today."

The blaze is now approximately tied with the Matilija wildfire in Ventura County of 1932 as the fourth-largest California wildfire on record.

Jarvis estimated that firefighting efforts had so far cost state and federal agencies about $54 million. He criticized a decline in federal funding for fire-prevention work, including the practice of controlled fires that make the chance of a wildfire of this intensity less likely.

Nearly 5,000 people are working to put out the fire, including firefighters from agencies across California and nearly 700 specially trained California prison inmates.

Tourism-dependent businesses around the park have bemoaned a slump in visitors at the peak of the late-summer tourist season. Jarvis said there was no need to for visitors to stay away.

"Yosemite Valley is open to the public and is gorgeous," he said, referring to one of the park's most scenic and visited areas, adding that it is more than 20 miles from the edge of the fire.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

has more cause to worry.

Syrians living in the United States are deeply divided about what should be done - with some calling for a swift bombing campaign to unseat President Bashar al-Assad, while others blame the crisis on rebel groups. Yet both camps are united in fearing that U.S. strikes will only mean more bloodshed back home.

The 2-1/2 year conflict has touched the lives of many ex-patriate Syrians, as stories unfold of family members and friends who have been killed or beaten - either by forces loyal to the Syrian regime or by the opposition.

In the town of Paterson, New Jersey, about 20 miles south of New York City, is a section called "Little Syria," where a sizable Syrian community lives and works. Restaurants and shops along Main Street keep their television sets tuned to news channels showing the latest developments in the civil war, while friends are quick to pass along Internet videos showing destruction from the latest attacks.

"I wanted the USA to step in from the beginning to defeat Assad," said Ahmed Jay, 22, whose family opened Paterson's Aleppo Restaurant after moving to the United States in 2004. "I have ten friends who have died; two cousins, one aunt, one uncle. We've gotten used to crying."

Others said they felt let down - by both the Obama administration and the international community. Britain's parliament earlier this week voted against military action in Syria.

"This is the third year Assad has been killing people," said Mohamad Rahmoun, 55. "Why do we have to suffer like this? I call the White House every day, every day. I tell them we need help."

"We want Obama to bomb the regime," he said. "But we don't want civilians killed."

On Friday, Obama said he was considering a "limited, narrow" military action to punish Assad for a poison gas attack outside Damascus that U.S. intelligence said killed 1,429 people.

On Saturday, White House officials were to make their case to the full Senate.

They could face a tough audience, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll showing that 53 percent of Americans, weary after a decade of foreign wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, believe the United States should stay out of Syria.

"A lot of people think something should be done, but nobody wants to do it," Obama said.

'I AM WORRIED'

The question is a particularly tough one for Syrians with family members back home. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 159,000 people of Syrian ancestry live in the United States, with the largest concentration in the northeast, according to data from 2009.

Mossab Awad, a 27-year-old medical student in Massachusetts, said he thought Washington had little choice but to strike, but worried about the safety of his mother, father and brother.

"How do we know the missiles won't kill innocent people, and how do we know it won't just cause Assad to be even more brutal?" Awad said. "He can set the region in flames."

Adding to Awad's anxiety is the fact that he has not heard from his family in his government-controlled hometown of Idlib for days.

"When I last talked to them, they were fine. But the phones have stopped working and I have heard the rebels are trying to take Idlib," he said. "I am worried."

Syrians in America who support the Assad regime, or simply distrust the rebel groups, warn that U.S. military intervention could only lead to further destabilization in the region.

'UNNECESSARY WAR'

Some blame the opposition for many of the atrocities, including the August 21 poison gas attack, and fear the country could follow down the path of Iraq, which has been plagued by sectarian violence since the end of the U.S.-led invasion.

Syrians and anti-war activists calling for "Hands Off Syria," have been staging daily protests in Manhattan.

The rebels "are driving America and the rest of the world into another unnecessary war in a fabricated, orchestrated scenario of having chemical weapons. Just like what happened in Iraq," said Tom Sarkin, 37, who was 17 when he immigrated to the United States from Aleppo.

Others said the Assad government was defending the Syrian people from an influx of foreign fighters and their Islamist influence.

"These (rebel) fighters aren't from Syria, they are called Islamic Brotherhood and they are from all over ... Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya ... from all over the world," said Farah Slebi, 22, who moved to Brooklyn, New York, five years ago to attend school.

She called Assad "a good man."

"He brought technology to Syria. He made online studying, just like in the U.S.," Slebi said. "We didn't ask for this freedom from Assad. We were free."

During a protest in Times Square on Thursday, Slebi got in a heated argument with someone from a counter-demonstration calling for regime change in Syria.

"We used to be friends," she said. But no longer: "He's against the government."

century ago are believed to have been secretly buried.

"We have found evidence of burial hardware - hinges on coffins," said Dr. Christian Wells, an anthropologist from the University of South Florida, in a briefing about a mile from the closed excavation site near the former Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys.

"There appear to be a few pieces associated with burial shrouds, and there are pins consistent with the 1920s and 1930s, - based on the style of the pins - and they appear to be brass," he said.

Some "large bone fragments" were found on the first day of digging, Wells said. They were human bones, he added, but it was impossible to know if they came from any of the teenaged boys who were housed at Dozier during its infamous 111-year existence. The school was closed in mid-2011.

The bones will be examined in laboratories at the University of Southern Florida and the University of North Texas, as part of a program funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and state of Florida.

After forensic investigators, using ground-piercing radar and old public records, detected 31 spots showing possible human remains, researchers planted crude white crosses on a nearby hillside to commemorate the unaccounted-for boys.

Some former residents of Dozier, now in their 60s and 70s, have told of brutal beatings and boys - mostly black juveniles - disappearing without explanation more than 50 years ago. Blood relatives of some of the boys have given DNA samples, to be matched against evidence taken from the skeletal remains.

Earlier on Saturday, Dr. Erin Kimmerly, a forensic anthropologist from USF, met with some family members and survivors.

"We're approaching it much like you would an archeological excavation," Kimmerle said. "It's all done carefully and by hand."

'NEVER HAD A CHANCE'

Tananarive Due, who came to the dig with some family members, said her great-uncle, Robert Stephens, died at the school in 1937.

"The story was ... he tried to run away at one point," she said. "The official cause of death was a stabbing by another inmate, that's what it was listed as. But with so many of these boys, who knows how they died? Their families never had a chance to say 'good-bye' to their loved ones."

Johnny Lee Gaddy, 67, said he was locked up from 1957 to 1961 for truancy. He said he was severely beaten, but in his teens became a good farm worker, hoping to get released.

Gaddy said he had heard of teens disappearing without explanation.

"I know some they said went home, but they hadn't been here long enough to go home," said Gaddy. "They said some others ran away or were transferred to other places. We never saw any bodies or funerals."

John Due, father of Tananarive, said descendants and civil-rights activists who pressed the state for disclosure of what happened to the young men ran into rigid resistance from authorities for decades.

"People didn't want to talk about it, and we found that particularly among black families," he said. "That's what racism does. It beats you down and you think you don't matter, so you won't speak up."

The forensic teams will work through Tuesday. Remains that can be identified will be re-interred at family plots and any unidentified remains will be numbered and buried - with records kept for later return to families, if any come forward.

The 46-year-old business owner bid farewell to his wife and three children in Brunei about a week ago and set off with seven of his closest friends. They flew to Los Angeles, then hopped on rented Harley-Davidson motorcycles and headed to the Midwestern state.

headline: Wedding bells a casualty of massive Yosemite blaze
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

Add fairy tale weddings to the list of casualties from the mammoth wildfire blazing in and around Yosemite National Park.

Hawaii couple Katie Sprouse, 33, and Jamil Folio, 36, spent a year making plans to exchange vows near the scenic park, where they were set to tie the knot before 70 relatives and friends on Saturday night - until the blaze started burning.

The so-called Rim Fire left the pair, who live in Maui, and two other couples with wedding dates at the evacuated Evergreen Lodge scrambling to make other arrangements, according to the Hawaii couple and lodge co-owner Lee Zimmerman.

"I had everything planned six months ago," Sprouse, an archeologist, told Reuters. "A week ago Friday, as I was packing to leave, the lodge called me to say it wasn't going to happen."

Fallout from the wildfire, the fifth largest on record in California after charring an area the size of Kansas City, Missouri, also forced the cancellation of the Strawberry Music Festival, a biannual bluegrass jamboree where Sprouse and Folio met two years ago.

On this holiday weekend, one of Yosemite's busiest periods, thousands of tourists have had to revise their travel plans after the fire crossed into the park and forced road closures at the premier tourist destination.

The fire has ravaged already struggling area businesses.

Proprietors had been counting on a healthy summer season to carry them through the slow winter months, particularly after an outbreak of the potentially deadly rodent-borne hantavirus scared off tourists last year.

Park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said the inferno had burned 6 percent of the landmark's 748,000 acres and forced the closure of 4 of 13 campgrounds.

Some 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, with most going during the peak months of June through August. Some 620,000 normally visit the park in August alone, but due to the fire, attendance has dropped.

"It's not super substantial," Cobb said of the drop, "but it is noticeable."

The park's most popular areas, including Yosemite Valley with the iconic Half Dome and El Capitan rock formations, remain open, Cobb said.

BUSINESSES STRUGGLING

Proprietors who depend on tourism near parts of the park that have been closed off said they were struggling to stay alive.

Chris Loh, 38, who owns the Iron Door Saloon in Groveland, estimated his business had fallen 98 percent, forcing him to lay off 45 employees, most of his workforce.

"Last summer was the hantavirus; the summer before was a control fire that got out of control," he said. "To have multiple years of having our season shut down early is just devastating."

James Nagle, president of the Yosemite Highway 120 Chamber of Commerce, estimated that tourism to the area had dropped by 25 percent. "A lot of the impacted businesses were counting on Labor Day weekend to get them through the winter," he said.

The blaze burned two of five cabins that Eliote Durham manages on the Tuolumne River in the Stanislaus National Forest. It also destroyed a well house, eliminating the water source for the Spinning Wheel Ranch where the vacation rentals are located, she said.

Durham was briefly allowed to go to the ranch, and she took photographs of potholes left when trees burned like candles into the roots.

"We're probably closed for the year," she said. "It looks like a moonscape."

The worst part for recovering businesses, Nagle said, is that when tourists do return, they will see a scorched landscape. "It's just ugly," he said.

Newlyweds Sprouse and Folio will marry in the Butterfly Creek Winery on Saturday in Mariposa, about 30 miles south of their original wedding site, and plan to return next year to the Strawberry Music Festival, where they got engaged last year. They had planned to attend the event this year as part of their wedding celebration.

When the fire forced Camp Mather, the festival's site, to be evacuated, organizers had to postpone the 32nd annual Labor Day bluegrass festival that draws about 5,000 guests.

"I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend," Sprouse posted on a festival Facebook page, "and we will see you all next year at our one-year anniversary!"



headline: Iowa board votes to end 'tele-med' abortions used by rural women

conferencing system, a practice used to serve women in rural areas without doctors.

The board voted 8-2 to ban the practice, with most members arguing the best standard of care for a woman seeking an abortion is to have a doctor perform a physical exam and talk face-to-face with the patient.

Currently, women in remote parts of the state who live far from abortion providers can speak with a physician through Internet video and then take the medication to induce an early-term abortion.

Among those voting to ban telemedicine for abortions was Monsignor Frank Bognanno, pastor of Christ the King Catholic Parish in Des Moines and appointed to the board by Republican Governor Terry Branstad, an abortion foe.

"This is a big deal ... This isn't like taking an aspirin," Bognanno said.

Ann Gales, a lawyer and board member, voted against the ban, arguing for more examination of the issue and raising concern that the vote was being rushed.

"If this is the right rule, it will still be the right rule after we engage in a more thorough discussion," Gales said.

State laws requiring doctors to be present when abortion-inducing drugs are administered are becoming increasingly common, particularly in states run by Republican governors or Republican controlled legislatures. Eleven states have them, said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group.

Abortion rights advocates say the laws are unfair to rural residents who do not have access to doctors and depend on telemedicine to get abortions, Nash said.

Greg Hoversten, D.O., the Iowa medical board's chairman, voted for the ban.

"How can any of us possibly find that a medical abortion performed over the Internet is as safe as one provided by a physician in person, at the bedside?" Hoversten asked.

The ban on so-called "tele-med" abortions was set to take effect on November 6.

A lawyer for Planned Parenthood told reporters after the vote that, "all options are on the table," including possible legal action to prevent the rule from taking effect.



headline: Top Florida health insurer touts Obamacare pain relief
byline: By Tom Brown
8:31am EDT

Florida's leading health insurer is reaching out to hundreds of thousands of state residents, touting temporary relief from what it describes as an imminent spike in premium rates due to President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law.

"When the new healthcare law takes effect, you may be surprised how much more you could pay for health insurance," says an advisory to consumers from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, also known as Florida Blue.

"Find out how much you'll save if you buy now," adds the advisory, which has been mailed over the past month to homes of existing policyholders and potential new clients.

"Let us help you get the best deal on health insurance right now," the notice says. "We can even tell you if you can get help paying for coverage from the government."

Under Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, millions of uninsured Americans will be able to buy government-subsidized health coverage on new online state insurance exchanges beginning on October 1. The cost of the new plans, which require insurers to provide more benefits to consumers and bar the exclusion of people with prior illnesses, is a key factor to making the enrollment effort a success.

However, the law also allows consumers to select from existing individual insurance policies now and extend them into 2014. While these existing policies may be cheaper in some states than those under the Obamacare reform plan, many may not contain the same comprehensive benefits.

Florida Blue's notice marks one of the more aggressive efforts by an insurer to tap into fears of "sticker shock" for the newer Obamacare plans. Republican-led Florida refused to set up its own insurance exchange, leaving the job to the federal government.

The enrollment stakes are big in the Sunshine State, where the U.S. Census Bureau says there are about 3.8 million people without health insurance. About a quarter of Florida's population is uninsured, giving it the third-highest rate in the country.

Florida's insurance regulators have said the cost of new insurance plans may rise 30 to 40 percent when compared with a fictional 2013 plan modeled to include the same benefits. But rates in the state are still being finalized between insurers and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Florida estimates don't include substantial subsidies that a majority of uninsured people may qualify for.

Florida Blue said the advisory is part of a direct mail advertising campaign aimed at drumming up new business for the Jacksonville, Florida-based giant, which reported $8.9 billion in revenues last year and covers more than 4.3 million people in its primary health business in the state.

The company, a leading contributor to the political action committee of Florida's Republican Governor Rick Scott, is one of nine insurers that have applied to sell non-group policies on the state's new marketplace and the only one that promises to cover every county in Florida.

Craig Thomas, the executive responsible for marketing and strategy at Florida Blue, said the consumer advisory - unlike anything seen from other health insurance companies in Florida - was part of what he termed "an appropriate marketing program."

It primarily targets many people purchasing coverage in Florida's individual market today who will be ineligible for premium subsidies under Obamacare, Thomas said.

Many of those same consumers will be hit with higher rates because of benefit changes and other factors tied to next year's full implementation of the law, he said.

"Their rates are generally going to go up," said Thomas. "New expenses are going to be reflected in next year's premiums."

HURTING ENROLLMENT

Federal and consumer groups dispute the state's projections. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on a recent Florida visit that competition for customers should help keep premiums in check.

An HHS spokeswoman declined to comment on the Florida Blue campaign, which comes against the backdrop of a full-court press by Scott and other Republican leaders in the state to undermine Obamacare.

But Ron Pollack, who heads Families USA, the national healthcare consumer advocacy group, strongly criticized the campaign and said it could hurt enrollment in Florida for coverage under the president's reform plan.

"This letter from an insurer that has tried to appear helpful to consumers is outrageous, misleading and for many, totally erroneous," Pollack told Reuters.

"People who get suckered into this appeal may very well lose many thousands of dollars in premium subsidies that become available soon if they enroll starting on October 1 in health coverage through the Affordable Care Act," he said.

Republican opponents of the reform law were the driving force behind Florida Senate Bill 1842. Signed into law by Governor Scott in May, the legislation prohibits Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation from providing any real protection for consumers from unreasonably high health insurance rates.

The federal government says it lacks the legal authority to regulate insurance premiums in individual states, though it is trying to persuade insurers to alter higher-priced plans when it can.

Sebelius, who has said she was "baffled" by Florida's move, commented earlier this month that she knew of no other state that had chosen to eliminate its own regulatory oversight, leaving consumers at the mercy of health insurance companies.

"It's really unconscionable that the Florida legislature and Governor Scott would take what is in essence the insurance cop, regulating insurance companies, off the playing field, take that cop off the beat ... It just doesn't make sense for families or small businesses. They're supposed to be on our side," said Tampa's U.S. Representative Kathy Castor.

Castor, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and seven other Florida Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to Sebelius decrying their state's deregulation of health insurers as "a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums more expensive on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace."

The same law that curtails Florida's rate-setting authority requires insurers to issue notices to consumers, blaming hikes in premiums on "the impact of federal healthcare reform."

A copy of one such notice, which all health insurance companies operating in the state will be required to use, was made available to Reuters by the insurance commissioner's office.

Thomas, who spoke in a telephone interview with Reuters from Jacksonville, said many Florida consumers could benefit financially from buying policies now, even though the plans would expire under Obamacare with no chance of renewal.

"The benefits and rates they buy now would not be changed until the product anniversary date gets here next summer," Thomas said. It will carry them with their current program well into next year," he added.

He and other company officials declined to comment on how Florida Blue's premiums in 2014 would compare to existing rates.

profile rulings on the highly divisive issue.

A court spokesman said on Friday that Ginsburg would be officiating at the ceremony on Saturday at the Kennedy Center. Ginsburg is the first justice to preside over a wedding ceremony involving a same-sex couple.

As reported by the Washington Post, Ginsburg will preside over the wedding of Michael Kaiser, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, and John Roberts, an economist.

In June, the court struck down a federal law that denied federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples and paved the way for gay marriage in California by letting stand a ruling that struck down a state law that restricted marriage to opposite-sex couples.

Gay marriage is legal in Washington, D.C., and 13 U.S. states.

In an interview with Reuters in July, Ginsburg said she was pleased with the court's decisions on the issue. Of the increasing public acceptance of gay marriage, she said, "I think the country is doing remarkably well. I don't think anyone could have predicted this."

headline: San Diego mayor accused of sexual harassment leaves office quietly
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

Bob Filner's term as San Diego mayor came to a quiet end on Friday as the veteran politician who resigned in the face of a sexual harassment lawsuit stayed out of the public eye on his last day in office.

Filner, a former Democratic congressman elected to lead California's second-largest city last year, announced his resignation last week as part of a settlement with the city over how to handle a lawsuit filed by his former press secretary.

The press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, is among 18 women who have accused the 70-year-old politician of making unwanted sexual advances toward them, but is so far the only one to sue him.

Parks department employee Stacy McKenzie filed a $500,000 battery and sexual assault claim against the city in what her attorney has said was a precursor to a lawsuit.

As part of the deal in which Filner agreed to resign, the city will join in his legal defense, according to an outline from the city attorney's office, which will be responsible for representing the mayor.

Filner had said that he would work until 5 p.m. on Friday, but it was unclear if he made an appearance at his office during the day. The city has scheduled a special election for November 19 to replace him, at a cost of between $5.9 million and $6.2 million.

A woman answering the phone in Filner's office at about noon declined to say if he was at work, and his spokeswoman did not return calls seeking comment. People who work in the lobby of the building said he had not been seen all week.

Todd Gloria, president of the city council who will act as interim mayor, told reporters that he would be moving into the office shortly.

"We're going to be moving forward and doing it aggressively because we're having to make up for lost time," Gloria told the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper. "We've been moving backward and that ends today."

Meanwhile, Gloria Allred, the Los Angeles attorney who represents Jackson and several other women making accusations against Filner, held a news conference to celebrate his departure.

"At 5 p.m. today, San Diego will finally be free of Bob Filner and all the shame that he has brought to the city of San Diego," Allred said.

In announcing his resignation, an emotional Filner apologized to San Diego residents but said no sexual harassment allegations had been proven against him.

"In a lynch mob mentality, rumors become allegations, allegations become facts, facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall," he said.

Nearly every elected official in San Diego from both parties had urged him to step down, including all nine members of city council.

headline: Sports drink helps California inmates on hunger strike stave off starvation
byline: By Sharon Bernstein
8:31am EDT

Inmates on a hunger strike to protest California's solitary confinement policies are staving off starvation by drinking Gatorade, but medical troubles are setting in nonetheless, a spokeswoman for the office in charge of prisoner healthcare said on Friday.

Of 123 inmates who are refusing food, 15 have lost potentially dangerous amounts of weight, and most report feeling weak and cold, said Liz Gransee, a spokeswoman for the official who oversees healthcare in the 34-prison system.

"Some of them aren't handling this as well as others," Gransee said. "Some of them have had IV fluids multiple times."

The inmates are participating in the largest and longest hunger strike in recent memory in California over the state's policy of keeping prisoners in near-isolation for years on end. Many are put in solitary confinement because prison officials believe they have gang affiliations.

As of Friday, 41 prisoners have refused food continuously since the hunger strike began on July 8, according to the state. Others have stopped at times and then begun again.

The hunger strike is the latest in a string of difficulties plaguing the California corrections system, which is under court orders to reduce crowding this year. Medical care in the system is under the control of a federally appointed receiver.

A panel of federal judges has threatened to hold Governor Jerry Brown in contempt if he does not act quickly, even if that means releasing thousands of inmates early. Brown wants to spend $315 million next year to lease space in private prisons, county jails and out-of-state lockups.

Under the supervision of the medical receiver, J. Clark Kelso, hunger strikers are monitored daily and examined by prison doctors at least weekly, Gransee said.

Deborah Hoffman, a spokeswoman for the state, said the health and safety of inmates was a priority, and that officials were working closely with the receiver's office to make sure participants receive adequate medical care.

She blamed the strike on gang leaders who she said were coercing other prisoners to participate in the strike. The state changed some of its guidelines for keeping prisoners in isolated conditions after a hunger strike in 2011, but has not budged any further in response to the current action.

VITAMINS AND GATORADE

The California inmates on hunger strike are taking vitamins and the electrolyte-replenishing sports drink Gatorade, which provides up to 625 calories per day and has helped slow the progress of starvation-related illnesses among participants, Gransee said.

A typical 30-year-old man needs between 2400 and 2600 calories per day, depending on his size and activity level. All of the hunger strikers are men.

Gransee said none have lost consciousness or been deemed to be near death so far. Last week, officials won permission from a federal court to force-feed some gravely ill inmates, even if they had signed orders asking not to be resuscitated. So far, however, that power has not been invoked.

Elena Kret-Sudjian, medical director of clinical nutrition at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center, said the inmates could still succumb to starvation because the beverages do not contain protein.

"When the body burns fat it always also burns the muscle and it's very dangerous ," Kret-Sudjian said. "When humans lose 40 percent of muscle they will die."

The state has not released figures on how much muscle inmates have lost. Gransee said 13 inmates have lost more than 10 percent of their body weight, and two have lost more than 15 percent of body weight, putting them into a higher risk category.

People can develop long-term medical problems from fasting for as little as one week, Kret-Sudjian said. By the seventh week, starvation symptoms are likely to be advanced. Long-term conditions can include heart disease and neurological problems.

"People may feel initially very irritable, even depressed," she said. "They may have reduced body temperature, be extremely sensitive to cold, or have chronic diarrhea, decreased sex drive and other complications."

The current hunger strike marks the second time in two years that prisoners have refused food over the state's solitary confinement practices. More than 4,000 prisoners are segregated from other inmates, most of them in so-called security housing units where they live in various degrees of isolation.

This strike, however, has gone on more than twice as long as the 2011 action and attracted more prisoners - 30,000 - at its peak.

Hundreds have been treated in prison clinics, hospitals and other facilities since the hunger strike began, Gransee said. Their symptoms have included dehydration, cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness and lightheadedness.



headline: Judge plans to appoint monitor for controversial Arizona sheriff
byline: By David Schwartz
8:31am EDT

A federal judge plans to appoint a monitor to watch over the operations of hardline Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose office had been found by the judge to have racially profiled Latino drivers during the lawman's crackdown on illegal immigration.

U.S. District Judge Murray Snow said in a court hearing on Friday that the Maricopa County lawman, who styles himself as "America's toughest sheriff," needed an independent check on his actions to prevent such profiling from continuing in the future.

"I intend to approve a monitor," Snow said of his plans, despite stiff opposition from the six-term sheriff of Arizona's most populous county. A ruling outlining changes to be made at the sheriff's office could come as early as mid-September.

Arpaio, 81, has attracted national attention with his get-tough stance on illegal immigration in Arizona, which borders Mexico. He faces an investigation and lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department, which accuses him of civil rights abuses.

The same judge handed down a decision in May ordering the sheriff to stop using race as a factor in law enforcement decisions, in response to a class-action lawsuit that tested whether police could target illegal immigrants without racially profiling U.S. citizens and legal residents of Hispanic origin.

The judge, who ruled Arpaio had violated the constitutional rights of Latino drivers, had ordered lawyers for the sides to try to agree to steps to correct the abuse, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful.

Arpaio attorney Tim Casey told the court on Friday that he was concerned about a court-appointed monitor usurping the sheriff's power.

"Who will resolve the disputes with him?" Casey asked the judge during a four-hour hearing. The judge responded, "I will resolve the disputes."

Casey said previously that Arpaio had already taken strong steps to correct past problems, including stopping controversial saturation sweeps that targeted and detained immigrants. Those operations stopped in October 2011.

Cecillia Wang, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project, which represents the plaintiffs in the case, said the sheriff's continued opposition to a monitor was troubling.

"There really needs to be a way to make sure he (Arpaio) is not violating the Constitution," Wang said.

Arizona has been at the heart of a bitter national debate over immigration since Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed a 2010 crackdown on illegal immigration that was subsequently challenged by the federal government.

The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed to stand a part of the law that permits police to question people they stop about their immigration status.

conferencing system, a practice used to serve women in rural areas without doctors.

The board voted 8-2 to ban the practice, with most members arguing the best standard of care for a woman seeking an abortion is to have a doctor perform a physical exam and talk face-to-face with the patient.

Currently, women in remote parts of the state who live far from abortion providers can speak with a physician through Internet video and then take the medication to induce an early-term abortion.

Among those voting to ban telemedicine for abortions was Monsignor Frank Bognanno, pastor of Christ the King Catholic Parish in Des Moines and appointed to the board by Republican Governor Terry Branstad, an abortion foe.

"This is a big deal ... This isn't like taking an aspirin," Bognanno said.

Ann Gales, a lawyer and board member, voted against the ban, arguing for more examination of the issue and raising concern that the vote was being rushed.

"If this is the right rule, it will still be the right rule after we engage in a more thorough discussion," Gales said.

State laws requiring doctors to be present when abortion-inducing drugs are administered are becoming increasingly common, particularly in states run by Republican governors or Republican controlled legislatures. Eleven states have them, said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group.

Abortion rights advocates say the laws are unfair to rural residents who do not have access to doctors and depend on telemedicine to get abortions, Nash said.

Greg Hoversten, D.O., the Iowa medical board's chairman, voted for the ban.

"How can any of us possibly find that a medical abortion performed over the Internet is as safe as one provided by a physician in person, at the bedside?" Hoversten asked.

The ban on so-called "tele-med" abortions was set to take effect on November 6.

A lawyer for Planned Parenthood told reporters after the vote that, "all options are on the table," including possible legal action to prevent the rule from taking effect.



headline: Lawyers for ex-NFL star say murder investigators misled witness
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

A judge on Friday declined to rule on a motion filed by Aaron Hernandez's lawyers that accused investigators of misleading at least one witness while building their murder case against the former NFL star.

Attleboro District Court Judge Robert Harbour said the motion, along with two others filed by defense attorneys last week, should be handled by Fall River Superior Court where Hernandez's arraignment will take place on September 6.

The hearing came a week after Hernandez, a former New England Patriots tight end, was indicted on murder and weapons charges. He has been accused of the June killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player whose bullet-riddled body was found near Hernandez's house in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

Hernandez appeared briefly in the Attleboro District Court on Friday, handcuffed and wearing a dark blue suit jacket and white open collared shirt, but did not speak. Members of Lloyd's family also attended the hearing.

In one motion, defense attorneys alleged that detectives told a potential witness at a Connecticut prison, Everett Garcia, that they were there "to help Aaron out," and that the meeting occurred a day before the defense team was due to meet with him.

They said investigators deliberately misled Garcia about their purpose in order to get a statement and "breached established ethical rules and may well have committed a criminal offense," according to the motion, which sought to prevent the state from committing such offenses again.

Another motion called for the state to provide the defense with any evidence it may not have provided already.

Prosecutors have denied that police said or implied they were there to "help Aaron out," according to court documents.

Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for the Bristol County district attorney's office, said allegations made in the motions were "simply not accurate" and that investigators had interviewed hundreds of people in the case.

"Our focus is on the tragic murder of Odin Lloyd, and that's our sole focus," he told reporters.

Hernandez, 23, was cut from the Patriots on June 26, shortly after police arrested him for allegedly orchestrating the execution-style murder. Lloyd, 27, had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancĂŠe.

Before his arrest, Hernandez had been a rising star in the NFL with a $40 million contract with the Patriots, one of the National Football League's top teams.

service center, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

There were no initial reports of damage, and the West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami watch, warning or advisory in effect.

"At this point, we've seen no ocean-surface disturbance," said Bill Knight, a scientist at the tsunami warning center in Palmer, Alaska. While no tsunami was expected, he said scientists were still monitoring the area for any earthquake-induced waves.

The earthquake, which struck at 8:25 a.m. Alaska Daylight Time, was strongly felt in Adak, about 1,300 miles southwest of Anchorage, said City Manager Layton Lockett.

"It was kind of hard to miss," Lockett said. "The strangest thing about this one was its length in time. I think people actually had time to get out of bed to see what was going on."

A magnitude 7 earthquake is likely to produce shaking that lasts 20 to 30 seconds, although it could last longer depending on local tectonics, Knight said.

A public radio station in Unalaska/Dutch Harbor, KUCB, interviewed a woman in Adak who said she timed the temblor at 40 seconds. The earthquake was followed by about 10 aftershocks of magnitude 3.5 or higher, Knight said.

Most structures in Adak can withstand earthquakes and other forces of nature, and any damage would likely be limited to water pipes and similar facilities that have yet to be fully examined, Lockett said.

"Generally, the buildings are built really strong. We do live on a volcano," he said of the town, which state records indicate has 321 residents.

There are two volcanoes on Adak Island, along with remnants of a third volcano, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory.

The quake was also felt in Atka, a tiny Aleutian Island Native Aleut village 65 miles northeast of the quake's center, where Knight said callers reported "strong shaking" but no damage.

headline: Yosemite wildfire still raging, keeps tourists away
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

Fire crews battling to outflank a monster wildfire inside Yosemite National Park made headway on Friday in confining flames to wilderness areas but were powerless to salvage the region's sputtering tourist economy at the end of its peak summer tourist season.

By morning, the tally of charred landscape from the so-called Rim Fire surpassed 200,000 acres, or nearly 315 square miles, three-quarters of that in the Stanislaus National Forest west of the park, fire officials said.

But a second straight night of cooling temperatures and higher humidity helped firefighters extend containment lines around nearly a third of the fire's perimeter by the start of its 14th day.

"I can't say we've turned a corner just yet, but we are making very good progress," U.S. Forest Service spokesman Dick Fleishman said. "We're going to keep chugging away."

With an overall footprint that now exceeds the land mass of Kansas City, Missouri, the blaze ranks as the fifth-largest California wildfire on record.

In terms of acreage burned, it also stands as the largest of dozens of wildfires that have raged across several states in the drought-parched west this year, straining U.S. firefighting resources.

A force of nearly 5,000 personnel are now assigned to the Rim Fire, mostly ground crews laboring around the clock with hand tools, chain saws and torches to cut fire breaks in the rugged terrain by clearing away unburned trees and dry brush.

They were supported by teams of bulldozers, water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers carrying payloads of flame-retardant chemicals.

Less than a quarter of the total burned acreage from the blaze lies inside Yosemite, and firefighters there have succeeded in limiting most of the damage to wilderness and backcountry areas in the park's remote northwestern corner.

The most popular portions of the park remained open to the public, including the scenic Yosemite Valley area famed for its towering granite rock formations, waterfalls, meadows and pine forests.

Nevertheless, park officials say the droves of visitors who typically crowd Yosemite in late summer have noticeably diminished ahead of the usually busy Labor Day weekend that marks the close of the summer tourist season.

TOURIST ECONOMY

The slump in visitation has in turn put a severe crimp in Yosemite-area businesses whose proprietors were counting on a healthy summer season after last year's hantavirus outbreak frightened away many tourists.

"We're laying off just about everybody, something like 45 employees," Chris Loh, 38, who owns the Iron Door Saloon in Groveland, a gateway town 20 miles west of Yosemite, said on Thursday.

"This is devastating for not just the businesses but the employees and the community," he told Reuters.

One notable casualty was the Strawberry Music Festival, an annual bluegrass jamboree that draws some 5,000 weekend guests to the area but was canceled when the site of the event, Camp Mather just outside the park, was closed, organizers said.

Some 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, most of them during the peak months of June through August.

While firefighters have so far prevented flames from invading the heart of Yosemite, the blaze has forced the closure of one of the park's four entrances and about half of its main east-west corridor, Tioga Road, along with numerous campgrounds, trails and two popular groves of giant sequoia trees.

Dry, hot conditions returned after daybreak on Friday. But calmer winds again favored efforts to check the spread of flames and allowed crews to continue controlled burning to create fire breaks and steer flames away from threatened or high-fuel areas.

Much of the work was devoted to preparing key roadside areas in the park and adjacent forest for controlled burns by hacking away excess vegetation before starting the risky, painstaking process of fighting fire with fire, Fleishman said.

One such containment line was being slowly burned from the edge of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir south to Tioaga road in a bid to fully enclose the fire's eastern flank, fire officials said.

The strategy also appeared to be paying off on the opposite end of the fire zone as an evacuation alert was listed late Thursday for Tuolumne, a town of about 1,800 residents whose homes were among some 4,500 dwellings counted as threatened by the fire all week west of the park.

The fire has destroyed dozens of homes and cabins in the region, but no serious injuries have been reported.



headline: Michigan governor seeks to dodge deposition in Detroit bankruptcy case
byline: By Joseph Lichterman and Bernie Woodall
8:31am EDT

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and other state officials are seeking to avoid being questioned by Detroit worker and retiree unions in the city's bankruptcy case, according to a motion filed on Friday.

Attorneys for the state, in a motion to quash depositions of Snyder, Michigan Treasurer Andy Dillon and others, said they would not be able to offer testimony relevant to the issue of whether Detroit is eligible to enter Chapter 9 protection.

The depositions, if they occur, would happen ahead of the late October start to hearings before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes on the eligibility issue.

The city filed the largest-ever municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history on July 18. Snyder, a Republican, had to approve a request from Orr to file for bankruptcy protection.

Ed McNeil of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 25 in Detroit, called Snyder's attempt to dodge being questioned "a cowardly attempt to hide behind a malicious legal maneuver."

The eligibility argument will focus on whether Detroit is insolvent, whether the city negotiated in good faith with its creditors, whether there were too many creditors to make negotiations feasible, and whether Detroit's bankruptcy petition of was filed in bad faith.

"The eligibility determination was made - and could only be made - by the city of Detroit and Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr," the state's motion said.

But McNeil said, "Every step of the way Governor Snyder has tried to stack the deck in his favor. He has blocked all opportunity for meaningful negotiations and mediation. Today's move is another attempt to bend the rules."

The state said the governor's reasoning for allowing the filing were laid out in a public letter Snyder wrote to Orr authorizing the city to seek bankruptcy protection.

It also argued that any request for discovery from state officials should be made after Orr and other city officials are deposed because "there has been no showing that the state officials were involved in any relevant eligibility determinations made prior to the filing of the petition."

Orr was deposed on Friday, but not on the question of the city's eligibility to file for bankruptcy protection.

Orr was deposed by attorneys representing objectors to a proposed deal that would terminate interest-rate swap agreements on casino tax revenue, which were used to hedge interest-rate exposure on some of the city's pension debt, at a discounted rate of as much as 25 percent, saving the city more than $70 million.



headline: Montana prosecutor to appeal ex-teacher's month-long sentence for rape
byline: By Laura Zuckerman

day sentence for a former teacher who raped a teenage student who later committed suicide.

District Judge G. Todd Baugh has come under harsh criticism since sentencing former Billings high school teacher Stacey Rambold on Monday to 15 years in prison, then suspending all but 31 days of that term, for the 2007 rape of 14-year-old Cherice Moralez.

Before handing down the sentence, Baugh said that Moralez, who committed suicide in 2010, was "probably as much in control of the situation" as Rambold, describing her as a troubled youth who seemed older than her age.

Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito said that Baugh, who has since apologized for his remarks, likely erred by misapplying state criminal codes and sentencing recommendations that would have required a minimum of two years in jail.

"I understand the importance of what has happened here, and we are moving as quickly as we can to right a grave injustice," said Twito, whose office had recommended the judge impose a 20-year jail sentence with half of it suspended.

He said he has spent the last week consulting with appellate experts at the state Attorney General's Office about appealing the sentence before the Montana Supreme Court. The state has 20 days to file such a motion once the judgment is signed by Baugh.

"At the end of the day, you have a girl in our community who has been lost. And you have a family who is still suffering," he said.

Rambold had been charged by Yellowstone County prosecutors in 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, the Montana equivalent of a rape charge, linked to Moralez, a student in a technology class he taught at Senior High School in Billings.

But Moralez killed herself in 2010 before the case could go to trial, crippling a prosecution case that depended on her testimony.

In an agreement with prosecutors later that year, Rambold admitted to a single count of sexual intercourse without consent and prosecutors agreed to postpone the case for three years and dismiss it entirely if Rambold completed sex offender treatment.

Prosecutors reinstated the case after being notified last year by the treatment center that Rambold, who was suspended in 2008 from his teaching post and later resigned, had been dismissed from the program for violating its rules.

In April, Rambold pleaded guilty to the rape charge stemming from the 2007 assault of Moralez in his Billings home, according to legal documents.

Filner, a former Democratic congressman elected to lead California's second-largest city last year, announced his resignation last week as part of a settlement with the city over a lawsuit filed by his former press secretary.

The press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, is among 18 women who have accused the 70-year-old politician of making unwanted sexual advances toward them, but is so far the only one to sue him.

Parks department employee Stacy McKenzie filed a $500,000 battery and sexual assault claim against the city in what her attorney has said was a precursor to a lawsuit.

As part of the deal in which Filner agreed to resign, the city will join in his legal defense, according to an outline from the city attorney's office, which will be responsible for representing the mayor.

Filner had said that he would work until 5 p.m. on Friday, but it was unclear if he was at his office. The city has scheduled a special election for November 19 to replace him, at a cost of between $5.9 million and $6.2 million.

A woman answering the phone in Filner's office declined to say if he was at work, and his spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment. People who work in the lobby of the building said he had not been seen all week.

Meanwhile, Gloria Allred, the Los Angeles attorney who represents Jackson and several other women making accusations against Filner, held a news conference to celebrate his departure, complete with "parting gifts" for the man she helped unseat.

"At 5 p.m. today, San Diego will finally be free of Bob Filner and all the shame that he has brought to the city of San Diego," Allred said.

In announcing his resignation, an emotional Filner apologized to San Diego residents but said no sexual harassment allegations had been proven against him.

"In a lynch mob mentality, rumors become allegations, allegations become facts, facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall," he said.

Nearly every elected official in San Diego from both parties had urged him to step down, including all nine members of City Council.

examination on Friday that she had gone to the media with her story because she felt a need to talk about the experience.

The woman, now a senior at the elite service academy in Annapolis, Maryland, denied defense attorneys' suggestion that an anti-Navy agenda prompted her to speak out on CNN and in an interview with The New York Times.

Friday marked her third day on the witness stand during a preliminary hearing to determine whether the three former members of the academy's football team accused of raping her will face a full court-martial.

The men - Tra'ves Bush, 22; Eric Graham, 21; and Joshua Tate, 21 - are accused of sexually assaulting her last year while she was passed out after drinking at an off-campus party.

The hearing follows a spate of high-profile military sexual assault cases, including some involving personnel whose job it was to prevent sexual abuse.

The woman was questioned repeatedly about her motives for speaking to media outlets in recent months.

"I had been quiet for so long, I was ready to tell everything that I could," she said. "When the media came to me, I literally just wanted to tell my story - my experience."

In 2012, during the early stages of the investigation, the woman said she didn't want the case to go forward and had not been cooperating with investigators.

A day earlier, Bush's attorneys played a recorded conversation between Tate and the woman in which she asked him to lie about the crime because she did not "want this to go anywhere."

The woman, who was a 20-year-old sophomore at the time of the alleged incident, has testified that she did not want to get anyone in trouble.

She has said she feared her mother would force her to leave the highly selective school, which educates Navy and Marine officers. Students are known as midshipmen.

Reuters generally does not report the names of sexual assault victims.

headline: U.S. says North Korea calls off trip aimed at securing American's release
byline: By Paul Eckert
8:31am EDT

North Korea withdrew its invitation to a U.S. envoy who was headed to Pyongyang to request the release of imprisoned, ailing American missionary Kenneth Bae, the U.S. State Department said on Friday.

North Korea canceled talks with Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, who was expected to visit Pyongyang on Friday and Saturday.

"We are surprised and disappointed by North Korea's decision," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said.

"We remain gravely concerned about Mr. Bae's health and we continue to urge the DPRK authorities to grant Mr. Bae special amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds," the spokeswoman said in a written statement, referring to the North by its formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

There was no immediate explanation for the decision from North Korea, which does not have diplomatic relations with Washington.

King's trip, announced this week as he was visiting U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, was seen as a potential signal of the start of a gradual thaw in relations between Washington and Pyongyang.

The State Department had termed the trip a "humanitarian mission" and played down any connection between Bae's release and diplomacy over the North's sanctioned nuclear weapons program.

Bae's sister in Washington state issued a statement saying their family was disappointed and worried about Kenneth Bae's health, but are "not giving up hope for a peaceful and timely resolution."

"We hold on to faith that DPRK and U.S. diplomats will resume talks soon, ultimately leading to my brother being released," said Terri Chung, Bae's sister.

Representative Rick Larsen, who represents the district where Bae's family lives, urged the North Koreans to free Bae.

"The North Koreans gain nothing from this course reversal. It is time to let Kenneth come home to his family and get the medical attention he needs," Larsen, a Democrat, said in a statement.

King secured the release of another Korean-American missionary, Jung Young Su, in 2011 as part of a trip to assess North Korean pleas for food aid.

FROSTY RELATIONS

Relations between Washington and Pyongyang have been frosty since the collapse of a deal in early 2012, when North Korea broke its promise to end its long-range rocket launches and prevented nuclear inspectors from examining its nuclear stockpile and production.

Nuclear talks involving the United States, China, Japan and the two Koreas have been deadlocked for five years, although Pyongyang in 2005 had signed on to a deal in which it would have frozen its nuclear program in exchange for economic and energy aid. North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006.

North Korea's human rights record has recently come under international scrutiny. A U.N. Public Commission of Inquiry in Seoul on August 20 was told by witnesses that public executions and torture are daily occurrences in the North's prisons.

Bae, 45, was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for attempting to overthrow the North Korean state by spreading anti-government propaganda, according to North Korean media. He has diabetes and his health has deteriorated since he was jailed.

North Korean state media said Bae started his plot to "topple" the country's government in 2006, a date that coincides with his own testimony about his arrival in China.

It accused him of spreading "false propaganda" and of bribing North Korean citizens in a bid to bring down the government.

Bae lived in a Chinese town that borders North Korea and worked for a tour company while undertaking missionary work inside North Korea.

North Korea says it permits religious freedom, but religious expression is tightly controlled in a state that acknowledges total loyalty to the Kim dynasty that has ruled for three generations. North Korea lands at the bottom of most independent surveys of freedom.

In online postings of one of his speeches on his missionary work, Bae described himself and a party he took to North Korea as "warriors for Christ" and told of holding a prayer meeting on a beach.

The postings have since been removed, as have all traces of Bae's involvement with a tour company operating out of China.

In a videotaped sermon, also removed from the Internet, Bae discussed bringing 300 people to a coastal town in North Korea to emulate the biblical destruction of the walls of Jericho.

Bae's family has acknowledged his deeply held religious beliefs but have suggested that his sympathy for North Korean orphans may have been behind his arrest.



headline: UK asked N.Y. Times to destroy Snowden material
byline: By Mark Hosenball
8:31am EDT

The British government has asked the New York Times to destroy copies of documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden related to the operations of the U.S. spy agency and its British partner, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), people familiar with the matter said.

The British request, made to Times executive editor Jill Abramson by a senior official at the British Embassy in Washington D.C., was greeted by Abramson with silence, according to the sources. British officials indicated they intended to follow up on their request later with the Times, but never did, one of the sources said.

On Friday, in a public statement, Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, said his newspaper, which had faced threats of possible legal action from British authorities, on July 20 had destroyed copies of leaked documents which it had received from Snowden.

Rusbridger said that two days later, on July 22, the Guardian informed British authorities that materials related to GCHQ had made their way to the New York Times and the independent investigative journalism group ProPublica.

Rusbridger said in his statement that it then took British authorities "more than three weeks before anyone from the British government contacted the New York Times.

"We understand the British Embassy in Washington met with the New York Times in mid-August - over three weeks after the Guardian's material was destroyed in London. To date, no-one has contacted ProPublica, and there has been two weeks of further silence towards the New York Times from the government," Rusbridger said.

Rusbridger added that, "This five week period in which nothing has happened tells a different story from the alarmist claims made" by the British government in a witness statement it submitted on Friday to a London court hearing regarding an investigation by British authorities into whether the handling of Snowden's leaks violated British anti-terrorism and official secrets laws.

A spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington told Reuters: "We are not going to get into the specifics about our efforts but it should come as no surprise if we approach a person who is in possession of some or all of this material."

The spokesman added: "We have presented a witness statement to the court in Britain which explains why we are trying to secure copies of over 58,000 stolen intelligence documents - to protect public safety and our national security."

A spokeswoman for the New York Times said the paper had no comment.

The British investigation was opened after authorities at London's Heathrow Airport earlier this month used an anti-terrorism law to detain David Miranda, the domestic partner of Glenn Greenwald, a Guardian writer who has met with Snowden and has played a lead role in writing about material the former NSA contractor leaked.

Miranda was held and questioned for nine hours before being allowed to resume his trip from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro, where he and Greenwald live. Greenwald has said that Miranda had carried Snowden related material from him in Brazil to Laura Poitras in Berlin, an American film-maker who has also met with Snowden, and that Miranda was carrying Snowden-related materials which Poitras gave to him back to Greenwald.

In her witness statement submitted to the British court on Friday, Detective Superintendent Caroline Goode, who said she was in charge of Scotland Yard's Snowden-related investigation, said that among materials officials had seized from Miranda while detaining him was an "external hard drive" containing data encrypted by a system called "True Crypt," which Goode said "renders the material extremely difficult to access."

Goode said the hard drive contained around 60 gigabytes of data, "of which only 20 have been accessed to date." She said that she had been advised that the hard drive contains "approximately 58,000 UK documents which are highly classified in nature, to the highest level."

Goode said the process to decode the material was complex and that "so far only 75 documents have been reconstructed since the property was initially received."

Goode also said that it was "likely" that Scotland Yard "is investigating a conspiracy with a global dimension. It is necessary to ascertain if this stolen, classified material has been disseminated to others in order to prevent further disclosure which would prove valuable to terrorists, thereby preventing further offences and protecting public safety."

She also said that "Disclosure of any information contained within those documents would be gravely injurious to UK interests, would directly put lives at risk and would pose a risk to public safety and diminish the ability to counter terrorism."



headline: U.S. plans reports on secret court orders to telecom providers
byline: By Alina Selyukh
8:31am EDT

The U.S. intelligence community has pledged to disclose more data about government surveillance programs by reporting annually how many secret court orders are issued to telecommunications companies under certain legal rules.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Thursday announced a plan to release the total number of legal orders issued every 12 months to telecom companies by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and the number of targets affected by those orders.

The court orders, under authority granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and National Security letters, allow collection of information about subscribers and call records, both for past communications and ongoing wiretaps. But only the aggregate annual numbers of these court orders will be made public.

The move is part of President Barack Obama's response to criticism about a lack of transparency in government surveillance programs following leaks by former spy agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Earlier this month, the government for the first time released opinions, previously labeled Top Secret, from the FISA Court. In the past its decisions involving electronic surveillance and communications collection by the National Security Agency had not been made public.

Privacy advocates have been urging the government to start shedding light on the FISA court and its surveillance operations and offered a tempered welcome to Thursday's news.

"This is a good start as it pulls back the covers a bit on the government authorities, but we still need more information," said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center advocacy group. It urged further disclosures about the cost and effectiveness of the surveillance.

Kurt Opsahl, senior staff attorney at the data privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation, expressed concerns that the pledge to release the number of affected investigation targets could severely limit the amount of data to be actually released.

"The number of targets affected isn't as much the issue on the public's mind as the number of innocent people affected," he said, pointing to the leaked secret FISC order to Verizon Communications Inc that did not address any targets.

Obama and other U.S. officials have said the NSA surveillance programs are lawful, have been approved by Congress and the FISA Court, and are aimed at detecting and disrupting terrorist plots.

"FISA and national security letters are an important part of our effort to keep the nation and its citizens safe, and disclosing more detailed information about how they are used and to whom they are directed can obviously help our enemies avoid detection," Clapper said in a statement announcing the new plan on Thursday.

The FISA court has said the NSA may unintentionally have collected as many as 56,000 emails of Americans a year from 2008 to 2011 and may have violated the Constitution before adjustments were made.



headline: Judge rules U.S. military cannot deny benefits to lesbian veteran and her wife
byline: By Alex Dobuzinskis
8:31am EDT

sex marriage because doing so does not serve any purpose for the armed forces, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.

The decision, which could set the stage for gay and lesbian veterans and their partners to claim those benefits, follows a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in June that invalidated a key portion of the U.S. Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that had defined marriage as between a man and a woman.

U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall, a federal judge based in Los Angeles, made the latest ruling in the case of a lawsuit filed last year by a U.S. Army veteran and her lesbian spouse.

The couple's attorneys had sought an order from the judge that would find unconstitutional a federal statute that denies benefits to U.S. military veterans in same-sex unions.

The lawsuit centers on a statute governing military benefits that defines spouse and surviving spouse to refer to those in opposite sex marriages.

Judge Marshall in her ruling cited evidence that the purpose of the spousal benefits was, in part, to ensure that service members perform to their highest potential and to make it easier to recruit and train Americans to join the armed forces.

"The denial of benefits to spouses in same-sex marriages is not rationally related to any of these military purposes," Marshall wrote.

Marshall in her decision noted that the Supreme Court, in its decision striking down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act, did not rule on the constitutionality of the statute that limits spousal benefits for veterans to those who are in heterosexual marriages.

A representative for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

The department had indicated that legislation was needed to grant veterans in same-sex marriages benefits for their spouses, the office of U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, said in a statement earlier this week.

Tracey Cooper-Harris, who sued in the case before Judge Marshall, served nine years in active duty with the U.S. Army, including a 2003 tour in Kuwait that resulted in her being sent into Iraq during the U.S.-led war, according to her complaint.

She was married to her partner and co-plaintiff in the case, Maggie Cooper-Harris, in Los Angeles in 2008.

Tracey Cooper-Harris was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2010 and, in anticipation of her possible death, she sought to make arrangements to provide for the support of her wife, according to the lawsuit.

But while the Department of Veterans Affairs found Tracey Cooper-Harris's disease was related to her service and awarded her disability compensation, she was told her spouse would not qualify for survivor benefits if she dies, the lawsuit stated.

The lawsuit said such treatment "demeans" the pair's marriage and also "the remarkable sacrifices" of Tracey Cooper-Harris in the U.S. armed forces.

EOG Resources Inc said on Friday that an Eagle Ford shale oil well fire that has burned since a blowout on Wednesday was nearly out as crews worked to cap it.

"EOG reports that the fire has substantially subsided at its Lavaca County well site and is close to being extinguished," the company said.

EOG said the company would issue a final update when the well is capped.

The fire followed a well rupture and explosion Wednesday evening at the EOG drilling operation about 134 miles west of Houston. No one was hurt.

EOG is the largest oil producer in the prolific Eagle Ford play with output of 173,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day as of June 30, the company said in an investor presentation earlier this month.

Eagle Ford oil production rose to just above 621,000 barrels per day in June, according to the Texas Railroad Commission, 60.2 percent higher than a year earlier.

EOG also said in the presentation that the company has cut its number of drilling days per well to less than 12 days, which reduces cost such as daily rates paid for drilling rigs.

Nabors Industries, which owns the world's largest land-rig fleet, also owns the rig at the burning well. A Nabors official said that the company expected "pretty bad damage" to the rig from the explosion and fire.

EOG is investigating the cause of the incident.



headline: Sandusky prison letter blasts Penn State settlements with victims
byline: By Daniel Kelley
8:31am EDT

Disgraced former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted of sexually abusing boys, in a letter from prison lashed out at the school's legal settlements with his victims.

Sandusky, who last year was convicted of 45 counts of abusing 10 boys over a 15-year period, in a letter to a documentary filmmaker seeking to exonerate Sandusky's former boss, Joe Paterno, argued that the school didn't take steps to defend its employees.

"The only concern from the beginning of this by administrators and trustees has been to protect their image," Sandusky wrote. "They didn't question what they called 'victims,' instead they opened their arms and offered settlements, psychologists, public events and media presentations."

Sandusky, who has denied any criminal activity, raised his complaints in a hand-written letter dated August 20 to filmmaker John Ziegler, who runs a blog called "The Framing of Joe Paterno."

Paterno, the winningest coach in Division I college football history until he was stripped of more than 100 victories because of the scandal, lost his job for failing to report Sandusky to authorities. He died early last year at the age of 85, about two months after he was fired.

Penn State officials did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Sandusky's letter focuses on one victim in particular, a man identified in court documents as Victim 5, who testified against Sandusky at trial and who was the first to reach a legal settlement with the school.

Victim 5's case was seen as one of the most significant for the school, because his abuse occurred in August 2001, six months after then-graduate assistant Mike McQueary reported seeing Sandusky raping a boy in a campus shower, according to Tom Kline, Victim 5's lawyer.

Sandusky wrote that his lawyer viewed Victim 5's claims as inconsistent and not worth focusing on.

"Mr. Sandusky, who is appropriately spending the rest of his life in jail, is simply lashing out," Kline said. "Make no mistake about it, the testimony given by my client was accurate and compelling."

Sandusky, 69, is serving a 30 to 60 year sentence.

Penn State has reached settlements with 25 of 31 men who claimed they were abused by Sandusky when they were boys, Kline said.

The terms of those settlements have not been disclosed, but the school has authorized $60 million in payouts.

Former university President Graham Spanier and two other former university officials face trial on charges they conspired to cover up the 2001 abuse case reported by McQueary.



headline: U.S. allows states to legalize recreational marijuana within limits
byline: By David Ingram
8:31am EDT

In a move marijuana advocates hailed as an historic shift, the Obama administration on Thursday began giving U.S. states wide leeway to experiment with pot legalization and started by letting Colorado and Washington carry out new laws permitting recreational use.

The Justice Department said it would refocus marijuana enforcement nationwide by bringing criminal charges only in eight defined areas - such as distribution to minors - and giving breathing room to users, growers and related businesses that have feared prosecution.

The decisions end nearly a year of deliberation inside President Barack Obama's administration about how to react to the growing movement for relaxed U.S. marijuana laws.

Advocates for legalization welcomed the announcement as a major step toward ending what they called "marijuana prohibition."

"Today's announcement demonstrates the sort of political vision and foresight from the White House we've been seeking for a long time," said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group.

"I must admit, I was expecting a yellow light from the White House," he said in a statement. "But this light looks a lot more green-ish than I had hoped. The White House is basically saying to Washington and Colorado: Proceed with caution."

Marijuana remains illegal and tightly controlled under federal law, even as about 20 states, plus the District of Columbia, allow the use of medical marijuana. Voters in Colorado and Washington legalized recreational use in groundbreaking ballot measures in November 2012.

Obama had signaled he did not want a new crackdown, telling ABC News in December: "It does not make sense, from a prioritization point of view, for us to focus on recreational drug users in a state that has already said that's legal."

The leeway for the states will go only so far, though, if Colorado, Washington or other states show they are unable to control the drug, the Justice Department said in a statement.

Forty-two percent of Americans age 12 or older have used marijuana at some point, according to a 2011 survey by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Obama has said he used marijuana when he was young.

One opponent of marijuana legalization said his group would redouble efforts to spread word of the negative effects the drug can have on adolescents.

"This is going to really quicken the realization among folks that more marijuana in our communities is not a good thing," said Kevin Sabet, a co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana.

U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Obama administration should not decline to enforce laws that it finds inconvenient or that it does not like.

"This sends the wrong message to both law enforcement and violators of federal law. Apprehending and prosecuting illegal drug traffickers should always be a priority for the Department of Justice," Grassley said in a statement.

EIGHT AREAS IN FOCUS

The Justice Department could have sued to block the Colorado and Washington laws from taking effect under the theory that they conflict with the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, the primary U.S. anti-drug law.

Coupled with the decision not to sue, the Justice Department sent a four-page memorandum to federal prosecutors nationwide outlining eight priority areas for marijuana enforcement.

While department officials said they are committed to enforcing federal restrictions on marijuana, prosecutors have now been told not to expend effort on cases unless they fall in one of the eight areas.

The areas include distribution to minors, situations when marijuana revenue is going to other criminal enterprises, trafficking across state lines and growing on public land.

The criteria mean, for example, that federal prosecutors will not charge a marijuana dispensary simply because it is large or profitable, said a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

But the criteria also stop short of guaranteeing immunity for anyone, leaving business and individuals open to prosecution if the case fits one of the eight areas, the official said.

Colorado and Washington will need to have regulatory systems to protect against those types of crimes, or else risk giving up the whole experiment, the department said in a statement.

Attorney General Eric Holder had a phone call on Thursday with the governors of Colorado and Washington to inform them of the decisions and told them there would be a "trust but verify" relationship between the Justice Department and the states, said the department official.

State officials said they shared Holder's concerns.

"This reflects a balanced approach by the federal government that respects the states' interests in implementing these laws and recognizes the federal government's role in fighting illegal drugs and criminal activity," Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson, both of whom are Democrats, said in a statement.



headline: U.S. appeals court upholds California ban on gay-conversion therapy
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

California's ban on a controversial therapy aimed at reversing homosexuality in children was upheld by a federal appeals court on Thursday that dismissed arguments by opponents of the measure who contended it violated free speech and parental rights.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling concluded that the so-called gay-conversion therapy ban does not violate the constitutional rights of counselors, minor patients or their parents.

"California has authority to prohibit licensed mental health providers from administering therapies that the legislature has deemed harmful," the ruling said.

The ruling by a three-judge panel resolved two lawsuits seeking to stop implementation of the measure, which prohibits therapists from performing sexual-orientation change counseling with children and teens under age 18.

Democratic Governor Jerry Brown signed the ban into law in September, making the nation's most populous state the first to prohibit the treatment, also known as reparative therapy, among youths. New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie signed a similar measure into law earlier this month.

The California ban marked a major victory for gay rights advocates, who say the treatment lacks a medical basis and can psychologically harm gay and lesbian youth.

Implementation of the law had been on hold pending the suits filed by Christian groups seeking to block it. The California Psychological Association and the California Board of Behavioral Sciences supported the ban.

A spokesman for state Attorney General Kamala Harris, who has defended the law, said she was not immediately available to comment. State Senator Ted Lieu of Torrance, the bill's author, applauded the decision.

"Today's federal court opinion puts another nail in the coffin for the discredited and harmful practice of gay-conversion therapy," he said in a statement. "Now the law has caught up to the truth: Sexual orientation is not a mental illness or defect."

Mat Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel, which had earlier obtained an injunction to block the law, issued a renewed criticism of the ban as politically motivated and "an astounding overreach by the state."

"Legislators and judges in the state of California have essentially barged into the private therapy rooms of victimized young people," Staver said in a statement.

olds.

Lawyers for the Pennsylvania Department of Health included the statement in their lawsuit against a county clerk who has been issuing marriage licenses to gay couples despite a state ban on same-sex nuptials.

"Had the Clerk issued marriage licenses to twelve-year-olds in violation of state law, would anyone seriously contend that each twelve-year-old has a legally enforceable 'interest' in his 'license' and is entitled to a hearing on the validity of his 'license,' else his due process rights be violated?" the state lawyers wrote.

Charles Joughin, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, said not only is the statement offensive, it is flawed.

"Same-sex couples enter into marriage for the same reasons as opposite-sex couples: love, commitment and family. Children are not capable of giving consent, a critical component of legal marriage," Joughin said in a statement.

Pennsylvania General Counsel James Schultz said the media mischaracterized the statement.

"Contrary to recent headlines, the administration does NOT equate same-sex marriage to the marriage of minors," Schultz said in a statement. The state's intention, he said, was to give examples of "other individuals whose marriages were excluded under state law."

But Timothy Haggerty, a historian at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who has studied the gay rights movement, called the statement "incredibly condescending."

"It's suggesting that adult members of our society are incapable of entering into contract because of their sexual orientation," Haggerty said. "It's calling gay relationships adolescent, which has long been a tool of homophobia."

The state last month sued Montgomery County Clerk D. Bruce Hanes in an attempt to stop him from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in suburban Philadelphia, a practice he started after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages in states where it is legal. Soon after the high court ruled, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced she would not defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage.

Thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia recognize gay marriage. Pennsylvania is among six potential states targeted by gay marriage advocates for a future push to legalize same sex nuptials in 2015 and 2016, according to the Freedom to Marry advocacy group.

A poll conducted by Franklin &amp; Marshall College in May found that 54 percent of Pennsylvanians surveyed support gay marriage. Another conducted in August found 76 percent disagreed with the Montgomery County clerk's decision to issue same-sex marriage licenses in violation of current state law.

On Thursday, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service announced that legally married gay and lesbian couples will be recognized as married for federal tax purposes even if the couples live in or move to a state that does not recognize marriage for same-sex couples.



headline: Third friend of accused Boston bomber indicted for misleading probe
byline: By Richard Valdmanis
8:31am EDT

A third college friend of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was indicted on charges he lied to federal investigators, the U.S. Attorney General for Massachusetts said in a statement on Thursday.

Robel Phillipos, 19, was one of the three people who removed a backpack full of fireworks and a laptop from Tsarnaev's dormitory room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth days after the April 15 attack, and later lied about it, prosecutors claim.

The two other students, Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov - both from Kazakhstan - have already been indicted on obstruction charges and detained pending trial. They have pleaded not guilty.

Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan, ethnic Chechens, are believed to have set off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the world-renowned marathon's finish line, killing three people and maiming scores of others in one of the worst attacks on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police a few days after the bombing. Dzhokhar was captured and imprisoned pending trial on terrorism charges.

According to the indictment against Phillipos, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sent a text message to Kadyrbayev on April 18, shortly after the FBI published pictures of the bombing suspects, asking his friend to go to his "room and take what's there."

The three men allegedly took the laptop, backpack and other items from Tsarnaev's room later that day and put them in a dumpster in nearby New Bedford. Investigators later recovered the items from a landfill, according to the indictment.

Phillipos, along with Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, concealed his actions during interviews with federal investigators between April 19 and April 25, according to the indictment.

"In so doing, he made numerous false and misleading statements to the agents," according to the statement from the office of U.S. Attorney General for Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz.

Phillipos, who has been under house arrest since May, faces up to 16 years in prison if convicted. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov face up to 25 years in jail or deportation.

Next year's Boston Marathon will include an additional 9,000 runners, boosting the field size to 36,000, amid a groundswell of support and interest in the wake of the bombing attack, the marathon's organizers said on Thursday.

long campaign to raise service sector wages.

Rallies were held in cities from New York to Oakland and stretched into the South, historically difficult territory for organized labor.

The striking workers say they want to unionize without retaliation in order to collectively bargain for a "living wage."

They are demanding $15 an hour, more than twice the federal minimum of $7.25. The median wage for front-line fast-food workers is $8.94 per hour, according to an analysis of government data by the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an advocacy group for lower-wage workers.

"It's almost impossible to get by (alone)," said McDonald's worker Rita Jennings, 37, who was among about 100 protesters who marched in downtown Detroit Thursday. "You have to live with somebody to make it."

Jennings said that in her 11 years at McDonald's, she has never received a raise above her wage of $7.40 an hour.

food workers at two different chains presented their managers with "strike letters" before walking out, Roger Sikes, a coordinator with the nonprofit group Atlanta Jobs With Justice, told Reuters.

And in Oakland, about 80 fast-food workers from various restaurants and their supporters rallied outside a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet.

"I'm doing it for the respect for myself and for my other coworkers," said Ryan Schuetz, 20, who works at McDonald's. He said his work hours have been reduced recently and that he was struggling to keep a roof over his head.

Several politicians came out in support of the protesters on Thursday.

In New York City, mayoral candidate and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn joined several hundred demonstrators outside a McDonald's in midtown Manhattan, holding a sign that read "On Strike: Wages Too Damn Low."

"Better pay will put more money into local businesses and spur economic growth," Democratic Representative George Miller of California said in a statement.

Robert Hiltonsmith, a policy analyst at Demos, a liberal think tank, said that if the minimum wage had kept up with productivity and inflation, it would be closer to $17 per hour.

He added that in many cases, low pay wasn't justified by a worker's lack of marketable skills.

"Seventy percent of these fast-food workers are aged 20 or over, so they're not teenagers, and of that 70 percent, about a third of them have college degrees," he said.

"So it's not that they don't have skills - in many cases, the jobs aren't there for them."

MOMENTUM BUILDING

Thursday's demonstrations in 60 cities followed several smaller strikes this year in the $200 billion U.S. fast-food sector, organizers said.

Last November, some 200 workers walked off their fast-food jobs in New York City, and groups in Chicago, Kansas City, Detroit and other cities followed their lead in April and July.

Fast-food wage activists are now receiving financial and technical support from the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).

Their active online presence echoes Occupy Wall Street - a movement that several supporters of the protests cited as an inspiration.

Restaurant chains and trade groups say the protests are unwarranted because fast-food and retail outlets provide Americans with millions of good jobs with competitive pay and ample opportunities to rise through the ranks.

"Our history is full of examples of individuals who worked their first job with McDonald's and went on to successful careers both within and outside of McDonald's," the company said in a statement.

In an emailed statement, Burger King said the company respects the rights of its workers but "does not make hiring, firing or other employment-related decisions for our franchisees."

The restaurant chains have not changed their wage policies despite the recent strikes.

The National Retail Federation called the strikes "further proof that the labor movement (has) abdicated their role in an honest and rational discussion about the American workforce."

And in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, the conservative Employment Policies Institute ran a full-page ad with a picture of a robot making pancakes, warning that higher wages would mean "fewer entry-level jobs and more automated alternatives."

"You can either raise prices and lose customers, or (automate) those jobs," said Michael Saltsman, EPI's research director. "The idea that restaurants are rolling in the money is not representative of the situation franchisees face."

Dorian Warren, an assistant professor of political science at Columbia University who has published work on labor organizing and inequality, said new protests in the South are "a huge, huge deal."

"The South has always been the model for low wage employment, from slavery to the Jim Crow laws, to the present. It's also the most anti-union part of the country, so the fact that workers feel empowered enough to take collective action is enormous," he noted.



headline: NFL, former players in $765 million deal to settle concussion suit
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

The National Football League has agreed to pay $765 million to settle a lawsuit brought by thousands of former players, many suffering from dementia and health problems, who accused the league of hiding the dangers of brain injury while profiting from the sport's violence.

The deal announced on Thursday comes a week before the NFL begins a new season and could resolve a long-running concern for team owners, who faced the prospect of a possibly lengthy trial that could have delved deeply into how well the league understood the toll that football can take on its players.

Sports business experts described the settlement, which will be paid out over decades, as a modest amount of money for the NFL, believed to generate total revenue of $9 billion or $10 billion a year.

But they also said the more than 4,500 former players who brought their case in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania could have a struggled to prove each plaintiff's health problems was a direct result of years on the playing field.

"It would certainly seem to be fair financial terms to the NFL as an enterprise, especially given how difficult this lawsuit has been from a PR and perception viewpoint on both the NFL and the sport of football," said Robert Boland, professor of sports management at New York University. "This is a very positive end for the NFL."

In recent years, there have been a spate of suicides among current and former NFL players, including Jovan Belcher, Junior Seau, Ray Easterling and Dave Duerson. While none of those deaths could be directly connected to football, violent and erratic behavior is consistent with symptoms of a condition tied to the repeated hits to the head that players endure during games and practices.

A growing body of academic research shows those hits can lead to a condition known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which can lead to aggression and dementia.

The research has already prompted the NFL to make changes in play, including banning the most dangerous helmet-to-helmet hits and requiring teams to keep players who have taken hits to the head off the field if they show symptoms including gaps in memory or dizziness.

"This is an important step that builds on the significant changes we've made in recent years to make the game safer, and we will continue our work to better the long-term health and well-being of NFL players," said NFL Executive Vice President Jeffrey Pash.

The league agreed to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation and a program of medical research as well as to cover some legal expenses, according to a court filing.

The NFL admitted no wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement.

ALL, AND ONLY, RETIREES

The settlement will cover all former NFL players but none still in uniform once approved by U.S. District Judge Anita Brody, who in July ordered both sides to meet with mediator Layn Phillips, a retired federal judge.

"The NFL has decided to stand up for all of the former players who are suffering from brain injuries," Kevin Turner, a former running back for the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots who served as a lead plaintiff in the case, told reporters on a conference call.

"The compensation provided in this settlement will lift a huge burden off the men who are suffering right now," said Turner, 44, who struggled to speak clearly due to Lou Gehrig's disease, which he said is linked to his eight years in the league. "They'll no longer have to make decisions regarding their health based on what they can afford but they can make it based on what is the best treatment."

Not all former players welcomed the deal.

"Big loss for the players now and the future! Estimated NFL revenue by 2025 = $27 billion," Kevin Mawae, a former center with the Seattle Seahawks, New York Jets and Tennessee Titans who previously served as president of the NFL Players' Association, said on Twitter.

The settlement spares the league from revealing all its records related to brain injuries in players, which likely would have come out had the case gone to trial.

A blanket settlement - with some of the money to be paid out over two decades - also helps the league by reducing the risk of a large jury award. The bulk of the money - $675 million - will be set aside for player benefits, to be paid out depending on symptoms, with diagnoses of Lou Gehrig's disease, formally known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, getting the largest payout, $5 million.

"It's far better than the alternative ... a constant drip, drip, drip of the NFL looking like they're strong-arming their former players," said David Carter, executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California.

The league had said it disclosed the information it had regarding research into brain trauma. It had previously argued that the lawsuit was inappropriate because the issue of player safety is governed by the collective bargaining agreements negotiated between the league and the players' union.



headline: Married gay couples win U.S. marriage tax benefits nationwide
byline: By Kevin Drawbaugh and Kim Dixon
8:31am EDT

All legally wed gay couples, no matter which state they live in, are entitled to the same U.S. federal tax benefits as married heterosexual couples, the Obama administration said on Thursday.

The U.S. Treasury ruling, following a landmark Supreme Court decision in June, means that whether a married gay couple lives in New York, which recognizes gay marriage, or Oklahoma, which does not, federal tax benefits and responsibilities apply.

The Supreme Court on June 26 invalidated a key portion of a 1996 federal law, known as the Defense of Marriage Act, which had defined marriage as between a man and a woman.

There was some uncertainty after the Supreme Court ruling about how the tax status of gay married couples would be treated in dozens of states that have laws against gay marriage.

"Today's ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve," Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said.

There are about 130,000 same-sex married couples in the United States, according to estimates from the Census Bureau.

Gay rights backers said the ruling could prompt same-sex couples in states where gay marriage is not legal to travel to states where it is recognized to wed.

"We will see many more couples from the more than 30 states without marriage equality come to New York," said Nathan Schaeffer, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda.

APPLIES RETROACTIVELY

Under the ruling, effective September 16, gay married couples may file amended tax returns to change their filing status going back to tax years 2010, 2011 and 2012 to seek possible tax refunds, the Treasury Department said in a statement.

A Supreme Court ruling in June made California the 13th of the 50 U.S. states to recognize gay marriage. The District of Columbia also recognizes gay marriage. Thirty-five U.S. states have laws on their books restricting marriage to a man and a woman.

"With today's ruling, committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation's federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home," said Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin.

The ruling means legally married same-sex couples may choose to file their federal taxes as married filing jointly or married filing separately.

Marriage status under federal tax law brings both benefits and penalties. On the plus side, legally married spouses are exempted from the federal estate tax. On the other hand, some gay couples above a certain income threshold may face the "marriage penalty" that some heterosexual couples confront.

An anti-gay marriage group denounced the ruling.

"The Obama administration is intent on forcing same-sex 'marriage' on an unwilling public," said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage.

STATE ISSUES

While the ruling brings clarity to federal tax returns, it could cause confusion for state returns filed by gay married couples in states that do not recognize their marriages.

In 24 of the states that do not recognize gay marriage, the law requires taxpayers to refer to federal tax returns, setting up a clash between state and federal authorities, the Tax Foundation, a conservative leaning think tank said in a report.

"Today's ruling will likely create administrative headaches for state taxing authorities in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages, because most state income tax regimes begin with federal taxable income as the starting point," Marvin Kirsner, a tax attorney at Greenberg Traurig, wrote in an email.

"States are going to have to issue guidance and I do think political opposition will arise," said Elizabeth Malm, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a free market think tank.

PUBLIC SUPPORT GROWS

President Barack Obama and many of his fellow Democrats back gay marriage, but the number of supporters in both parties has been increasing in recent years. Republicans were parties to the Supreme Court lawsuit over the Defense of Marriage Act, but were mostly quiet after the court ruled.

A spokesman for John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said he had no comment on the latest ruling announced by the Treasury Department.

Separately on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said same-sex spouses would have access to coverage in the nursing home where their spouse lives under privately run Medicare health insurance plans.

Other government agencies are expected to make announcements soon to square their policies with the Supreme Court ruling.

For example, the Social Security and Veterans administrations have statutes that turn to state law in defining marriage. Gay marriage backers are awaiting clarification from those agencies on treatment of legally married gay couples.



headline: Hundreds rally to protest Montana judge over 31-day rape sentence

old student who later killed herself and the judge's remarks suggesting the victim was partly at fault.

District Judge G. Todd Baugh has come under harsh criticism since sentencing former Billings high school teacher Stacey Rambold on Monday to 15 years in prison, then suspending all but 31 days of that term, for the 2007 rape of Cherice Moralez. Rambold, 54, also received credit for one day served.

Before handing down the sentence Baugh said that Moralez, who committed suicide in 2010, was "probably as much in control of the situation" as Rambold and that the teen seemed older than her age.

The judge, who apologized for his remarks on Wednesday, made an appearance at the protest but did not speak, said Marian Bradley, president of the Montana chapter of National Organization for Women and co-organizer of the rally. Auliea Hanlon, the dead girl's mother, also attended the rally, which organizers said drew 500-700 people.

Kate Olp, co-organizer of the Billings protest and an online petition demanding that Baugh step down, said his comments may lead victims of sexual assault to avoid reporting it for fear of mistreatment by the legal system.

"He took the responsibility off the shoulders of an adult and placed it on the fragile shoulders of a child," she said.

Demonstrators observed two minutes of silence for Moralez and her mother, Olp said.

"I looked up and it was absolutely unbelievable. I looked out over the crowd. There were tears everywhere; people were crying, men and women," she said.

In sentencing Rambold, Baugh ignored a recommendation by prosecutors for a 20-year term with half of it suspended for the 2007 rape of Moralez, then a student in a technology class taught by Rambold at Senior High School in Billings.

Rambold was charged in 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, the Montana equivalent of rape.

Moralez killed herself in 2010 while the case was pending. Prosecutors struck a deal with Rambold in which he admitted to a single rape charge to be dismissed in three years if he successfully completed sex offender treatment.

The case against Rambold, who was suspended in 2008 from his teaching post and ultimately resigned, was reinstated after prosecutors learned he had been expelled from the treatment program for breaking its rules.

He pleaded guilty in April to sexual intercourse without consent stemming from the 2007 assault of Moralez.

At the sentencing hearing Monday, Rambold's attorney, Jay Lansing, argued his client had been sufficiently punished by losing his job, his marriage and his self-esteem in the aftermath of the rape charges, court records show.

headline: Massive wildfire prompts new travel restrictions through Yosemite
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

Firefighters determined to keep a massive blaze from invading the heart of California's Yosemite National Park took advantage of cooler weather early on Thursday to slow the spread of flames ahead of a holiday weekend marking the end of the peak summer tourist season.

Progress came after a long stretch of Yosemite's main east-west road was closed on Wednesday through the western half of the park as crews tightened their grip on the blaze, extending containment lines around 30 percent of the fire's perimeter by the end of its 12th day.

Capping a week in which the footprint of the blaze grew by tens of thousands of acres, a cooling trend and rising humidity levels helped curb the fire's growth overnight, with just 270 acres added to the tally of charred landscape by dawn on Thursday.

Since erupting on August 17, the so-called Rim Fire has blackened nearly 193,000 acres, or more than 300 square miles of dry scrub and timberlands, mostly in the Stanislaus National Forest west of the park, fire officials said on Thursday. Its cause was still being investigated.

The firefighting force has grown to more than 4,800 personnel, consisting mostly of crews wielding hand tools, chain saws and even special torches to create fire breaks by clearing the rugged terrain of unburned trees and chaparral ahead of advancing flames.

They are backed by teams of bulldozers, water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers carrying payloads of flame-retardant chemicals.

The battle inside Yosemite was focused largely on preventing flames from penetrating any farther toward the core of the park, including the Yosemite Valley area famed for its towering rock formations, waterfalls, meadows and pine forests.

Some 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, most of them during the peak months of June through August. Park officials said they have already noticed a decline in the crowds of visitors typically seen in late summer.

BIGGER THAN CHICAGO

With an overall footprint that exceeds the land mass of The city of Chicago, the blaze ranks as the sixth-largest California wildfire on record.

As of Wednesday, less than a quarter of the total burned landscape, about 43,000 acres, lay inside Yosemite, confined to the northwest corner of the 750,000-acre (300,000-hectare) park.

Earlier this week, flames closed in on the park's Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, which supplies 85 percent of the water consumed by San Francisco and several other communities some 200 miles to the west.

But utility officials said there was little risk to the artificial lake because of the rocky terrain and lack of brush surrounding it.

On the opposite end of the sprawling fire zone west of Yosemite, crews fought to keep flames away from some 4,500 homes in a string of small communities along the fringe of the Stanislaus National Forest, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Dennis Matheson.

Most of those dwellings have been ordered evacuated or were under advisories urging residents to leave voluntarily or be ready to flee at a moment's notice. The fire has already destroyed dozens of homes and cabins, but no serious injuries have been reported.

DEFENDING YOSEMITE'S CORE

Matheson said treacherous, hard-to-reach terrain was hindering efforts to carve additional containment lines around the blaze, and he estimated it would take another week to fully enclose it.

"I think it's very safe to say that we're looking at least at the first week of September," Matheson said.

The flames last week forced the closure of a stretch of Highway 120 that leads into the west side of the park and serves as the main gateway from the San Francisco Bay area.

On Wednesday, the closure was extended eastward along 120, also called Tioga Road, as far as Yosemite Creek midway through the park. But the rest of the road through Yosemite's only east entrance remained open, along with two other gates that allow access from other directions in the southern half of the park.

The expanded closure of Highway 120 - the only east-west route that completely bisects the park - was imposed to allow fire crews to establish new containment lines along the road before the blaze approaches, said Yosemite spokesman Tom Medema.

"That will limit the access for visitors to and from the east side of the park, quite possibly over Labor Day weekend, which will have a significant economic impact on the area and (be)an inconvenience for visitors," he said.

Several campgrounds and trails, along with two landmark groves of giant sequoia trees, also were closed to the public.

Firefighters on Thursday also continued to burn containment lines from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir south to Tioga Road in a bid to keep the fire from creeping further east into the park, Medema said.

The blaze has been among the fastest-moving of dozens of large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West in recent weeks, straining national firefighting resources.

An Eastern black rhinoceros, a critically endangered species, was born at Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo this week, the first in 24 years, officials said on Thursday.

The male calf, weighing 60 pounds at birth, was born on Monday to first-time mother, Kapuki, age 8, according to the zoo. The father is 27-year-old Maku.

Black rhinos were nearly driven to extinction in the 1990s. They are a major poaching target, mainly due to the misconception that their horns have medicinal value.

There are 5,055 Eastern black rhinos in the wild, and 68 Eastern black rhinos in 25 accredited zoos across North America. Lincoln Park has three adults of the species.

"The calf divides his time between nursing, following mom around, and napping, and that is exactly what a baby rhino should be doing," Mark Kamhout, mammals curator, said in a statement.

Rhinos are tricky to breed - the gestational period is 15-16 months and parents have "incredibly small windows for conception," Kamhout said.

"Together with the zoo's endocrinologists, we worked to pinpoint the exact window for Kapuki and Maku to get together for breeding," Kahhout said.

The mother and calf will be off display for a couple of weeks while they bond, the zoo said.

The Atlanta zoo saw the birth of its first-ever eastern black rhino earlier this month.



headline: Boston Marathon to accept another 9,000 runners in 2014
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

Next year's Boston Marathon will include an additional 9,000 runners, amid a groundswell of support and interest in the wake of the bombing attack this year which killed three people and cut the event short, the marathon's organizers said Thursday.

Boosting the field size to 36,000 runners at the April 21, 2014, race would make for the second-largest turnout in its history, since 38,708 runners toed the starting line in Hopkinton, Massachusetts at the race's 100th anniversary in 1996.

"We understand many marathoners and qualifiers want to run Boston in 2014, and we appreciate the support and patience that the running community has demonstrated because of the bombings that occurred this past spring," said Tom Grilk, executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the race.

The increase, a one-time break from the race's normal cap of 27,000 runners, will help to accommodate the 5,624 athletes who were still on the course this year, when a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs exploded amid thousands of spectators, volunteers and athletes at the finish line and brought the race to a halt.

The attacks prompted an intense investigation, with law enforcement officials combing both the scene and thousands of still and video images received of Boston's best-attended sporting event.

Three days after the April 15 attack, FBI officials released photos of two men they believed were responsible for the bombing in a plea for the public's help in identifying the suspected bombers. The pair, later identified as brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, tried to flee Boston that night, first killing a university police officer in a failed attempt to steal his gun and later engaging in a firefight with police in Watertown, Massachusetts that ended with older brother Tamerlan, 26, dead and younger brother Dzhokhar fleeing the scene.

Most of the Boston area was locked down for the following day while police searched for Dzhokhar, who was found hiding in a boat in a suburban back yard. Now 20 years old, the surviving brother is awaiting trial on charges, including the murder of four people and using a weapon of mass destruction.

Tsarnaev, a naturalized U.S. citizen, has pleaded not guilty to all charges and may face execution if convicted.

Entry into the Boston Marathon is a prized goal for many U.S. runners, who must meet strict age-graded qualifying times in other marathons to earn a spot at the starting line.

To accommodate an expected surge of interest, race organizers are introducing a staggered registration system, in which runners who have posted times at least 20 minutes faster than the normal qualifying time for their age group will be able to register on September 9, those who have beaten their minimum qualifying time by 10 minutes will enter on September 11, and those who have run marathons 5 minutes faster than their qualifying time can register on September 13.

After that, if spots remain, runners who have met their normal qualifying times will have an opportunity to register.

The stricter times could make for a faster-than-usual average field in the 2014 edition of one of America's most elite marathon events.

headline: U.S. transfers two Guantanamo detainees to Algeria

8:31am EDT

The United States said on Thursday it had transferred two men from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the government of Algeria as part of its ongoing effort to close the controversial prison.

The Pentagon said Nabil Said Hadjarab and Mutia Sadiq Ahmad Sayyab were transferred on Wednesday and arrived in Algeria the same day, leaving 164 detainees at Guantanamo, including 84 others cleared for release years ago.

The two Algerians were detained in Afghanistan more than a decade ago and sent to Guantanamo prison - Hadjarab on January 20, 2002, and Sayyab on February 15, 2002.

The Obama administration first announced plans to repatriate the two inmates last month, resuming the transfer of detainees for the first time in nearly a year.

The Pentagon said the decision to release the two men followed a comprehensive review by an interagency task force which looked at security issues and other factors.

Classified Defense Department files released by the anti-secrecy group Wikileaks said Hadjarab, 34, who was raised in Algeria and France, was believed to be a member of the al Qaeda Global Jihad Support Network with ties to the Algerian Armed Islamic Group.

He traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 where he received AK-47 training in Jalalabad. After the U.S.-led invasion, he fled to the Tora Bora mountains with other al Qaeda supporters. He was wounded by a U.S. helicopter while trying to flee Tora Bora and was later captured by Afghan troops, the U.S. documents said.

Sayyab, 37, also is considered to be a member of the Al Qaeda support network and is thought to have received training in making improvised explosive devices from the Moroccan Armed Islamic Group in Jalalabad, U.S. documents said.

After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States he traveled over the Tora Bora mountains trying to reach Pakistan. He was detained by Pakistani authorities and later handed over to U.S. forces, the documents said.

President Barack Obama has vowed to close the prison at Guantanamo, which has held dozens of prisoners, most without charge, for more than a decade. But the process has dragged on for years.

Obama promised to close the facility during his 2008 presidential campaign, citing its damage to the U.S. reputation around the world, but he has been unable to do so in 4-1/2 years in office, in part because of resistance from Congress.

"Closing Guantanamo remains a priority," said Lieutenant Colonel Todd Breasseale, a Pentagon spokesman. "For this reason, we continue to seek a lifting of the current restrictions that significantly limit our ability to transfer detainees out of Guantanamo, even those who have already been designated for transfer."

Breasseale said Wednesday's transfers were possible because the two men were among the few detainees going to a country that was not specifically barred by legislative restrictions and Algeria was willing to provide the security and humane treatment assurances required by the United States.

The Guantanamo prison camp was established during the presidency of George W. Bush to house foreign terrorism suspects after the September 11, 2001, attack on the United States.

A hunger strike and daily feeding of dozens of inmates through a tube inserted through the nose into the stomach has fueled calls to shut the detention center.

Last month lawmakers blasted the prison's cost, about $2.7 million per prisoner per year, compared with $70,000 per inmate at maximum-security federal prisons.

The last prisoner transferred out of Guantanamo was Omar Khadr, the youngest inmate and last Westerner held at the base. He was sent in September to finish his sentence in his native Canada.

foot trailer in the woods leading up to his trial in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin.

Shellie Zimmerman's comments were aired in an interview with ABC News a day after she pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of perjury for lying during her husband's Florida bond hearing last year.

Asked whether she wanted to remain married and have children with him, Shellie replied: "That's something I'm going to have to think about."

She also revealed she was not staying with her husband on the night Martin was killed in the central Florida town of Sanford because she walked out on him after an argument.

"I was staying at my father's house," she said. "We had gotten into an argument the night before and I left."

George Zimmerman was acquitted last month of murder for killing Martin, a 17-year-old, as he walked back to the townhouse where he was staying after buying snacks at a nearby convenience store.

Shellie Zimmerman declined to say whether she and her husband were currently living together.

Her husband did not attend a court hearing on Wednesday where she was sentenced to a year of probation, 100 hours of community service and ordered to write a letter of apology to the judge.

Shellie Zimmerman told a judge last year the couple was essentially destitute, even though they had accumulated $135,000 between them through contributions to an online legal defense fund, prosecutors said.

During George Zimmerman's trial, prosecutors presented some evidence of his state of mind but nothing about the unspecified argument and temporary split with his wife.

Prosecutors claimed he profiled Martin as potentially one of the thieves that had been breaking into neighborhood homes, then pursued Martin and shot him during a confrontation. Zimmerman claimed he shot Martin in self-defense.

Shellie Zimmerman said that while her husband was out on bond awaiting trial, the couple lived in hiding "pretty much like gypsies."

"We've lived in a 20-foot trailer in the woods, scared every night that someone was going to find us and it was going to be horrific," she said.

She also apologized to Martin's parents.

"I'm so deeply sorry for their loss. I can't even begin to understand the grief that a parent experiences when they lose a child," she said.



headline: Detroit seeks $350 million ground-breaking loan

8:31am EDT

Detroit, which made the largest Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, on Thursday filed a request for proposals for $350 million in unprecedented financing, the city emergency manager's office said.

Detroit is the first large U.S. city to seek so-called debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing after asking for bankruptcy court protection.

The city plans to use about $250 million to terminate a complicated swaps deal related to previous bonds issued to finance pension debt, said Bill Nowling, press secretary for Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr.

mail to Reuters. It would be a line of credit the city could draw from, but it may not use all of it, he said.

Nowling also said Orr plans to use proceeds from the financing to invest in "quality of life" improvements for Detroit's nearly 700,000 residents.

In 1950 the city had 1.8 million people at a time when the three automakers that still call the Detroit area home dominated the auto industry. But in recent years the city that has accumulated more than $18 billion in debt and has made international headlines with its urban blight, roaming packs of feral dogs and outdated and sometimes inoperable police and fire equipment.

The termination of the swaps payment would be made to Merrill Lynch, a unit of Bank of America, said Nowling.

The state's emergency manager law grants to Orr most of the powers once afforded to the city's mayor and city council, including responsibility for the city's finances.

"The city is contacting a range of financial institutions, commercial banks, investment banks and hedge funds," Nowling said in an email to Reuters. He said the city would expect the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to approve the loan.

breaking case gets bogged down.

Detroit heads to a trial in October to prove it is eligible for bankruptcy. The city filed for Chapter 9 protection in mid-July.

On Wednesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy petition, cleared the way for the city to seek approval next month of the $250 million swaps deal that will give it unencumbered access to its casino revenues.

Detroit collects about $180 million annually from casinos, which is among the city's most stable sources of revenue.

In an interview with the Detroit News on Wednesday and published on Thursday, Orr said he wanted to use the casino tax revenue to back the borrowing. In the interview, Orr first publicly mentioned his intent to seek the funding.

Lending to a bankrupt entity might seem like a bad idea, but the loans are repaid ahead of almost all other creditors and Wall Street banks and hedge funds often provide a debtor-in-possession, or DIP, loans.

UNPRECEDENTED

But under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code, which covers the rare municipal bankruptcies, there is no real precedent for a DIP loan. As a result, there is no blueprint for determining the collateral the city can pledge, and how much power the judge has to enforce a lender's rights if Detroit defaults.

The only example of a municipal bankruptcy loan that turned up in a search of court records by Reuters was Prichard, an Alabama city with about 30,000 residents, which received court approval for a loan in 2000 during the first of its two recent bankruptcies.

The lack of precedent may make the loan a tough sale or may prompt lenders to demand control of the bank account receiving the casino revenue, lawyers told Reuters. DIP loans in corporate bankruptcies are often used to as a way to control a restructuring, and it was through a DIP loan that the U.S. Treasury guided the 2009 bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler.

Speculation about the need for such a loan has been a topic among lawyers and advisors who specialize in bankruptcy, and one lawyer told Reuters earlier this month he had been contacted by hedge funds about lending to Detroit.

"They see that it's a mess, and whenever there's a mess and they have a mop, someone will pay to clean it up," said Lewis Feldman, a lawyer who specializes in public finance at the law firm Goodwin Proctor.

old man tried "ripping him off" in a drug deal, court documents in the case said.

Kenan Adams-Kinard, 16, made the statement to friends as he was being sought in the beating death of Delbert "Shorty" Belton, according to an affidavit filed by a Spokane police detective in support of a criminal complaint against the suspect.

Adams-Kinard said he "was trying to buy an ounce of crack cocaine from 'Shorty' and 'Shorty' tried ripping him off," the affidavit said in paraphrasing an account related to police by an unidentified witness. Adams-Kinard said he then punched Belton and took his money back, the affidavit said.

Spokane police declined to comment to Reuters about the affidavit, but NBC News quoted a police spokesman as saying there was "no evidence to support" the allegation that Belton was dealing drugs.

Adams-Kinard and his accused accomplice, Demetrius Glenn, also 16, have been charged as adults with first-degree burglary and first-degree murder in Belton's slaying.

A friend, Natalie Flom, who had planned to meet Belton for a game of pool at a north Spokane fraternal lodge last Wednesday, found the U.S. Army veteran in his car in the parking lot with severe head and facial injuries.

Belton, who survived a gunshot wound to the leg during the Battle of Okinawa as Allied forces launched an assault on one of the home islands of Japan in 1945, died the day after he was found in the car.

The affidavit said police also seized a handwritten letter that Adams-Kinard allegedly wrote to his mother that likewise said the crime was a drug deal gone sour.

"I took his wallet and another ounce of crack from his pockets. He was unconscious, so I made sure he was still breathing, and then I took off," the affidavit quoted the letter as saying.

Flom dismissed as absurd the suggestion that her elderly, diminutive friend was a cocaine dealer.

Kinard's account, Flom told Reuters. "But it is so sick that anyone would try to pull his reputation down."

Security videotapes and photographs from the lodge and surrounding businesses led investigators to identify the teenagers as suspects, police said.

Glenn turned himself in the day after the attack, and Kinard-Adams was arrested four days later hiding out in the basement of a Spokane apartment building, police said.

Glenn was being held in lieu of $2 million bond, and Adams-Kinard's bail was set at $3 million, a higher figure because he was already established as a flight risk, according to a spokeswoman for the Spokane County prosecutor's office.

stricken wife because she had asked him to stop her pain "for good."

school janitor, was arrested early Wednesday without incident after he called 911 and said he had shot his wife, Virginia Chumbley, police officials told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Virginia Chumbley, 44, was found shot three times in the face at the couple's home early Wednesday.

"She told me she wanted to end the pain," Chumbley told the local WKYT TV station in an interview late Wednesday from the Laurel County jail where he was being held, about 72 miles southeast of Lexington, Kentucky.

"I said, 'Jay,' I said, 窶連ll I've got is what the doctors gave you, the medicine, the pain pills.'" She said, 'No. I took enough of them. I want you to stop my pain for good,'" Chumbley said in the interview.

A local law enforcement official said he had concerns about the circumstances of Virginia Chumbley's death.

"I'm a long way from calling it a mercy killing," said Detective Charlie Loomis of the Laurel County Sheriff's Office. "I'm not going to swallow that right yet."

Virginia Chumbley had previously battled breast cancer that had spread to other areas of her body, Loomis said. She was in cancer treatment at the time of her death, though he couldn't say if it was still breast cancer.

According to the TV report, Chris Chumbley said his wife was suffering from breast cancer.

Chumbley remained in jail Thursday in lieu of $200,000 bond, Loomis said.

After responding to Chumbley's call early Wednesday, police found him waiting for them in the living room, near the front door, and arrested him without incident, Loomis said.

Loomis said he had not checked Chumbley's criminal record, but cited neighbors as having observed "issues" in the past between the couple, who have grown children and at least one grandchild who didn't live with them.

The two were married for more than 20 years, and Virginia Chumbley was not working at the time of her death, Loomis said.

A man accused of shooting his wife and then posting a photo of her lifeless body on Facebook pleaded not guilty at a court hearing in Miami where he was formally charged with second degree murder.

Derek Medina appeared Thursday in Miami circuit court three weeks after the death of his wife, Jennifer Alfonso. He was held without bond and could face a life sentence if convicted. Prosecutors may seek a first-degree murder charge when a grand jury meets next month.

Medina, 31, gained notoriety when he allegedly confessed in a Facebook posting that he had just shot and killed 26-year-old Alfonso in the kitchen of their South Miami townhouse because she was punching and physically abusing him. The posting was accompanied by a photo of her bloodied body on the floor.

Medina wrote to his "friends" on Facebook, "I'm going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife. Love you guys, Miss you guys ... My wife was punching me, and I am not going to stand any more with the abuse so I did what I did. I hope u understand me."

Miami-Dade Police Department confirmed the authenticity of Medina's Facebook posting.

Medina's arrest affidavit said that he confessed to shooting Alfonso multiple times after a dispute turned violent when she began kicking him and punching him. Alfonso had said she was leaving him, Medina said.

He also told police that Alfonso had armed herself with a knife during their argument, but he said that was after he had gone to his bedroom for a gun.

According to the affidavit, after Medina knew that Alfonso was dead, he changed his clothes and went to his parents, then turned himself in to police.

The author of six online books on topics that include marriage counseling, Medina had been employed on the front desk at a luxury Miami-area condominium. The couple married in 2010, divorced in early 2012, then remarried a few months later.



headline: Fort Hood shooter sentenced to death for 2009 killings
byline: By Ellen Wulfhorst and Jana J. Pruet
8:31am EDT

A military jury on Wednesday sentenced a U.S. Army psychiatrist to death for murdering 13 people in 2009 at Fort Hood, Texas, where he gunned down unarmed soldiers in what he later called retaliation for U.S. wars in the Muslim world.

Major Nidal Hasan shouted "Allahu Akbar" ("God is greatest" in Arabic) during the attack and later said he wanted to be a martyr. Now he faces death by lethal injection, pending an automatic appeal, for the rampage that also wounded 31 people.

The jury deliberated just over two hours before deciding on the death penalty for Hasan, who opened fire with a laser-sighted handgun in a medical facility at the sprawling central Texas military base just weeks before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan.

Bald with a thick beard, wearing Army fatigues and seated in a wheelchair, Hasan showed no expression as the president of the jury read aloud the sentence that he "be put to death." He is paralyzed from being shot by police upon his arrest on November 5, 2009.

Death sentences are rare in the military, which last executed a member of the service 52 years ago. Hasan, 42, will become the sixth man on death row at the U.S. military's prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

The same jury convicted him on Friday of 45 counts of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder.

"A weight has been lifted off my shoulders," said widow Joleen Cahill, who said she agreed with the sentence. Her husband, retired Chief Warrant Officer Michael Cahill, was among those killed. The other 12 were active duty soldiers.

Cahill's daughter Keely Vanacker added: "We are tired. We are hurt. We are resolved that justice has been served."

Gale Hunt, the mother of Specialist Jason Hunt, 22, also killed by Hasan, said she too was satisfied, although she added: "As a Christian, I can't say I wish death upon anyone."

An American-born Muslim, Hasan, who acted as his own attorney, said in his opening statement on August 6 that he was the gunman and had switched sides in what he considered to be a U.S. war on Islam.

He told mental health evaluators he wanted to become a martyr. Lawyers assisting him have said he was actively seeking the death penalty, although Hasan disputed that claim.

CRIES FOR HELP

In asking the jury to return a sentence of death prior to deliberations, prosecutor Colonel Michael Mulligan told the jurors: "Don't be fooled."

"He is not now and never will be a martyr. He is a criminal. He is a cold-blooded murderer," Mulligan said. "He is not giving his life. We are taking his life."

After Hasan learned he would be deployed to Afghanistan for six months, prosecutors said, he gave away his possessions and trained at a local shooting range.

Witnesses to the shooting said Hasan first sat among the soldiers who were waiting for immunizations and clearance at Fort Hood's medical processing center before deploying overseas.

He asked a civilian woman to leave and then opened fire, they said. Investigators recovered 146 shell casings.

Witnesses described a chaotic scene of people diving for cover, bloodied bodies and cries for help. Private Francheska Velez, 21, was heard screaming "my baby, my baby" in a futile plea to save her unborn child.

The pregnant private was one of three women killed in the shooting. The 13 killed ranged in age from 19 to 62.

Beyond his stunning admission in opening arguments, Hasan spoke little during his trial, turning down repeated opportunities to make a statement or present evidence.

Standby defense attorneys for Hasan attempted unsuccessfully to present so-called mitigating evidence to argue for a life sentence. Hasan objected, complaining he had "overzealous defense counsel."

Twenty family members and victims gave evidence during the sentencing phase, recounting heart wrenching stories about their loss, grief and struggles to rebuild their lives.

A young widow talked about her two suicide attempts, and a staff sergeant described his partial paralysis, brain damage and his debilitating anger and depression since he was shot.

The jury also sentenced Hasan to be dismissed from the military and to be stripped of all pay.

The death sentence means the start of an automatic and lengthy appeals process, typically a minimum of four years, according to military officials. A military execution requires the approval of the Fort Hood commanding general and the U.S. president in order to take place.

In addition, at least two military appellate courts will automatically review the case to determine whether the sentence was appropriate. Eugene Fidell, an expert in military justice at Yale University, said he expects Hasan will be assigned lawyers to argue his appeal regardless of whether he wishes to challenge the sentence.

The last person to be executed by the U.S. military was Army Private John Bennett, who was hung in 1961 for rape and attempted murder.



headline: After 24 years, San Francisco Bay area prepares for new bridge
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

era bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland was retired on Wednesday night, 24 years after it partially collapsed during a major earthquake.

But the big party once planned for next Tuesday, when a majestic $6 billion replacement bridge is scheduled to open, has been canceled - fitting for a project that was six years late, cost five times initial estimates and suffers from broken seismic safety bolts that some critics say render it unsafe.

Four California governors oversaw the planning of what will be the world's largest self-anchored suspension span. Two of them, Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, lobbied for a simple concrete viaduct. Bickering over everything from the exact location to whether or not to include a bicycle path (it does) delayed the project for years.

East Bay politicians including Governor Jerry Brown, who as Oakland's mayor at the time had pushed hard for a landmark structure that might move the workhorse Bay Bridge - second-busiest highway bridge in the country - out of the shadow of the glamorous Golden Gate.

They got one. With its single 525-foot (160-meter) white tower, the span rises up as a breathtaking sight. Eastbound motorists, who were caged on the lower deck of the old gray bridge, will now take in wide-open views of the bay and hills.

But the cracked fasteners discovered in March have sparked questions about whether the connector, which will carry up to 280,000 vehicles a day, could withstand the next big earthquake.

A temporary retrofit is supposed to take pressure off 32 fractured bolts, some as long as 25 feet, until a permanent fix can be installed on the 2.2-mile (3.5-km) span in December. But fears about the integrity of another 2,268 bolts linger, along with questions about the quality of Chinese steel used in construction and concerns about visible cracks in welds at the base of the tower.

For Abolhassan Astaneh, a professor of bridge engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, the cracked bolts are only one piece of what he sees as a fundamentally flawed project. He has been warning about the dangers of the self-anchored suspension bridge since designers first proposed it in 1998.

"It looks like this bridge was designed in the 16th century when no one knew anything about bridge engineering," he told Reuters. "This is going to go in the textbooks on how not to build a bridge."

Transportation officials went back and forth on whether to delay the opening after the broken bolts were discovered, but after the Federal Highway Administration signed off they decided to press ahead.

"The existing bridge is the one folks ought to be worried about," Steve Heminger, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission said at a news conference. "We've got two structures out there side by side. And there is no contest between which one is safer."

The old bridge closed at 8 p.m. Wednesday, and the new one is scheduled to open at 5 a.m. Tuesday, leaving Bay Area residents without an essential roadway link for five days.

QUAKE COLLAPSE

The 1989 earthquake shook loose a 50-foot (15-meter), 250-ton section of the eastern span's upper deck, which buckled and fell onto the lower deck. The collapse following the 6.9 quake killed one driver, shut down the essential connector for a month and exposed the fragility of the bridge, hailed by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1955 as one of the "seven modern wonders of the world."

Now it will be dismantled piece by piece at a cost of $300 million, nearly four times what it cost to build, said Randy Rentschler, a transportation commission spokesman.

Unlike the old bridge, the new span was built to sway along with an earthquake rather than to resist it. Investigative reports in the Sacramento Bee and the San Francisco Chronicle newspapers, however, called into question whether the new bridge would perform as designed.

Two engineering firms and the Federal Highway Administration examined the bolts and deemed the bridge safe. Engineers believe the fasteners cracked during manufacturing, during exposure to the bay's moist environment, or both.

But Berkeley's Astaneh and other engineers continued to warn about a possible catastrophe. He said he would take the train from his East Bay home to San Francisco and never drive on the bridge.

It is impossible to predict when the next major earthquake will strike the Bay Area and test the span, but area residents can predict the state of regional traffic with the Bay Bridge closed over the Labor Day weekend.

They are braced for gridlock.

headline: San Bernardino, California, gets bankruptcy protection
byline: By Tim Reid

setting battle between bondholders and California's giant public pension system.

The case is being closely watched by other U.S. cities, including Detroit, which declared the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy last month, where budgets are burdened by soaring pension costs.

Judge Meredith Jury of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California ruled that San Bernardino was eligible for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection despite opposition by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers. The $260 billion pension fund is the city's biggest creditor and America's largest pension fund.

"I am ruling as a matter of law that the city is eligible," Jury said. "I don't think anyone in this courtroom seriously thought the city was anything but insolvent."

A city must be insolvent and have proof to have negotiated in good faith with creditors to be eligible for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy.

Michael Gearing, an attorney appearing for Calpers, called Jury's decision a "dangerous precedent" that will encourage other cities to "create a crisis because they have a large number of creditors."

Amy Norris, a Calpers spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement: "Calpers is considering its options for appeals."

San Bernardino, a city of 210,000 located 60 miles east of Los Angeles, filed for bankruptcy protection in August 2012, citing a $46 million deficit and arguing that it had effectively run out of cash to meet its daily obligations.

The city must negotiate with its creditors and produce a final bankruptcy plan on which the judge will ultimately have to rule. Whether pension and other debt payments, including to holders of $50 million in pension obligation bonds, will have to be treated equally or not will remain a key issue - one that could eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

LIKE OTHER CREDITORS?

Calpers argues that it should not be treated like other creditors and must be paid in full because California state law says the fund must always be fully paid, even in a bankruptcy. Bondholders argue that federal bankruptcy law trumps state statutes and say Calpers should be forced to fight with other creditors over how much they are paid under an exit plan.

Another California city, Stockton, which was also found eligible for municipal bankruptcy protection in April, is expected to present an exit plan in September. Creditors will be asked to vote on the plan.

The judge overseeing that case said dealing with Stockton's obligations to Calpers will probably be unavoidable under an exit plan.

In an unprecedented move, San Bernardino stopped paying its $1.2 million bimonthly employer payments to Calpers for a year after declaring bankruptcy, the first California city to halt payments to the fund.

It resumed paying Calpers last month but continues to renege on payments to other creditors, including holders of $50 million in pension obligation bonds.

Calpers said the city still owes the fund $14.3 million in arrears and that it will "aggressively pursue all past due contributions, resulting interest and penalties."

"These payments are statutorily required and necessary to deliver on the pension benefits promised to San Bernardino employees as a form of deferred compensation," the powerful pension system said.

But the judge questioned who will provide for those payments.

"If Calpers gets all the money they want, under what they say is their statutory right, who isn't going to get paid? All the employees? How is that going to help Calpers?" she said.

The case is In re San Bernardino, 12-bk-28006, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Riverside).



headline: Obama says more work needed to achieve ideals from King's 'Dream' speech
byline: By Ian Simpson and Jeff Mason
8:31am EDT

The United States is struggling to realize the vision that civil rights leader Martin Luther King described in his famous "I Have a Dream" speech 50 years ago, President Barack Obama said on Wednesday, citing economic security as a still elusive goal.

Obama, the first black U.S. president, spoke to thousands of marchers on Washington's National Mall to commemorate King's landmark address, which came to symbolize the struggle for equality among blacks and whites in America.

Joined by members of the King family and two former presidents, Obama and his fellow speakers urged Americans to continue the slain leader's quest for justice.

Obama said King's speech inspired millions of Americans to fight for a more equal society and rights that people now take for granted.

"To dismiss the magnitude of this progress, to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed, that dishonors the courage, the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years," Obama said.

"But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete," he said, calling economic justice the "unfinished business" of the civil rights battle.

Marchers, many wearing T-shirts with King's face on them, began their walk near the U.S. Capitol.

They were led by a line of military veterans and people who had been at the 1963 march, their arms linked. People sang "We Shall Overcome" and other civil rights anthems.

Fighting restrictive voting rights laws that Democrats say hurt minorities, combating joblessness and reducing gun violence among African Americans are among the issues that civil rights leaders have put at the forefront of their efforts in 2013.

"This march was supposed to be about jobs, but it's about a lot more," said marcher Ash Mobley, 27, of Washington, who said she was there to represent her grandmother, who had been at the 1963 event.

The marchers heard speeches from former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and members of King's family on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the site of King's address on August 28, 1963.

A bell rang at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), 50 years to the minute after King ended his clarion call of the civil rights movement with the words "Let freedom ring."

King's speech is credited with helping spur passage of sweeping civil rights laws. A white prison escapee assassinated him in 1968.

King's elderly sister, Christine King Farris, said her brother's dream was alive, if unfulfilled.

"Yes they can slay the dreamer, but no, they cannot destroy his immortal dream," she said.

MORE TO DO

Bernice King, the slain leader's youngest child, urged the crowd to stay true to the ideals enunciated by her father.

"If freedom is going to ring in Libya, in Syria, in Egypt, in Florida, then we must reach across the table, feed each other and let freedom ring," she said.

Obama's address commemorating King, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and advocate of non-violence, came as the White House edges closer to launching military strikes in Syria in response to what U.S. officials say they believe was a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government on civilians.

Obama made no mention of Syria in his address.

The president, whose mother was white and whose father was black, has sometimes seemed reluctant to weigh in on persistent racial divides in the United States, but he spoke forcefully about the issue last month after the man who killed black Florida teenager Trayvon Martin was acquitted.

On Wednesday Obama said the 1960s civil rights movement led to greater freedoms for many different groups of U.S. society.

"Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed, and Congress changed, and, yes, eventually, the White House changed," he said to applause, a nod at his own historic election.

"Because they marched, America became more free and more fair - not just for African Americans, but for women and Latinos, Asians and Native Americans, for Catholics, Jews, and Muslims, for gays, for Americans with a disability," he said.

The "Let Freedom Ring and Call to Action" ceremony came as almost half of Americans say much more needs to be done before the color-blind society King envisioned is realized.

Wednesday's event capped a week-long celebration of King's historic call for racial and economic justice. They included a march on Saturday that drew thousands of people urging action on jobs, voting rights and gun violence.

Obama and Clinton also used their remarks to chide lawmakers in Washington for partisan battles that have prevented agreement on issues such as the budget and immigration reform.

"I would respectfully suggest that Martin Luther King did not live and die to hear his heirs whine about political gridlock," Clinton said. "It is time to stop complaining and put our shoulders against the stubborn gates holding the American people back."

Major Nidal Hasan may wish to die a martyr, as he told mental health evaluators before his trial in the shooting deaths of 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, but his execution is likely years away.

The case against Hasan, who was convicted of the 2009 murders of 13 people at the Army base and sentenced to death on Wednesday by a military jury, will now move to a lengthy appeals process that includes several stages of review.

Appellate review is mandatory for courts-martial involving the death penalty, regardless of the defendant's wishes, according to Eugene Fidell, a professor at Yale University who studies military justice.

The case next goes to the "convening authority" - the high-ranking military officer responsible for calling the court-martial - for review. The officer can approve or reject the verdict or the sentence.

That step, which has no analogue in the civilian justice system, has drawn increasing scrutiny from Congress and military leaders concerned about sexual abuse after the controversial dismissal of a sexual assault conviction against an Air Force lieutenant in Italy earlier this year.

If the officer approves the Hasan jury's findings, the case will then move to the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals, an intermediate appellate court with military judges.

Hasan could refuse legal representation, as he did at trial, which would present an untested issue under military law.

Experts said the court will likely assign appellate Army lawyers to argue on Hasan's behalf even if he doesn't want to fight the sentence. During his trial, Hasan declined to call witnesses and admitted he killed the victims as part of what he said was a war between the United States and Muslims.

Military law states that appellate defense counsel "shall represent" a defendant when the United States is represented by counsel.

"I am confident that they will appoint lawyers for him," Fidell said. "They will file a brief whether he likes it or not."

ETHICAL QUESTIONS

But Tom Fleener, a defense lawyer who handles military cases, said that could present murky ethical issues.

"What do you do if the client wants to die?" he said. "You'd essentially be arguing against your client's interests."

If the sentence is upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeals, the next review takes place at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the military's highest court, which has five civilian judges.

Hasan or the government can petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review that court's ruling, though it is rare for the Supreme Court to do so.

Like any defendant - military or civilian - facing the death penalty, Hasan can also challenge his conviction in federal district court by filing a habeas corpus claim, typically on constitutional grounds, Fidell said.

The final step in the military appeals process for capital cases is presidential approval. By the time Hasan's case reaches that stage, it's likely that President Barack Obama will no longer be in office, said William Cassara, a defense lawyer who specializes in military cases.

Military executions are exceedingly rare with the last coming in 1961. In 2008, President George W. Bush approved the execution of Ronald Gray, an Army private convicted of multiple rapes and murders. Gray is appealing his case in federal court.

There are five military prisoners on death row, including Andrew Witt, an airman whose sentence was overturned two weeks ago by a military appeals court. He remains on death row while the government considers whether to appeal.

Not counting Witt's case, convening authorities and appeals courts have overturned 11 of the 16 death sentences given to military defendants since 1984, when the current system was put in place.

Because Hasan effectively failed to mount a defense at trial, however, finding grounds to appeal his sentence could be very difficult, Cassara said.

Yosemite National Park, faced with the spread of a massive California wildfire, closed a second key route into the park on Wednesday that could keep some visitors from reaching one of the nation's top outdoor destinations over the Labor Day weekend.

The shutdown of Tioga Road comes as the so-called Rim Fire, which has now scorched an area larger than the land mass of Chicago, was burning deeper into the park and headed toward the tourist hub of Yosemite Valley.

The blaze, which stands as the sixth largest on record in state history, on Tuesday reached a reservoir that serves as the primary water supply for San Francisco, some 200 miles to the west.

Crews were attacking the eastern flank of the fire as it spread toward Yosemite Valley as well as the western edge, where some 4,500 homes in a string of small communities stood in the path of the flames, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Dennis Matheson said.

He said that treacherous, often inaccessible terrain was largely preventing firefighters from cutting new lines around the blaze and estimated it would take another week to fully contain it.

"I think it's very safe to say that we're looking at least at the first week of September," Matheson said. "A lot of it is footwork, creating containment lines by hand."

Of the 187,500 acres already blackened by the Rim Fire, more than 43,000 acres had burned inside Yosemite, up 3,000 from Tuesday, according to fire officials. Containment lines have been established around 23 percent of the fire's perimeter.

The flames last week forced the closure of a stretch of Highway 120 that leads to the west side of the 750,000-acre (300,000-hectare) park and is the main entrance from the San Francisco Bay area.

Tioga Road, the second of the four access routes into the park, was closed to allow fire crews to build containment lines along the road before the blaze approaches, said Yosemite spokesman Tom Medema.

"That will limit the access for visitors to and from the east side of the park, quite possibly over Labor Day weekend, which will have a significant economic impact on the area and (be) an inconvenience for visitors," he said.

Some 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, most of them during the peak months of June through August.

'ERRATIC FIRE BEHAVIOR'

The blaze, the biggest California wildfire since October 2007, is being fought by a force of some 4,100 personnel, backed by teams of bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters.

Firefighters plan to burn containment lines from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in the remote northwestern section of the park south to Tioga Road to stop the fire from moving further east into the park, Medema said.

By Wednesday afternoon, any remaining campers from the Yosemite Creek Campground and Tamarack Flat Campgrounds will be evacuated, he said. The park also closed the Crane Flat Campground.

The blaze has been among the fastest-moving of dozens of large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West that have strained national firefighting resources.

Cooler temperatures, higher humidity and calmer winds had been expected to help the firefighting effort Tuesday night, said Alison Hesterly, spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Later on Wednesday, temperatures were expected to be hot and dry, hitting a maximum of 94 Fahrenheit (34 Celsius) in the area with a minimum of 15 percent humidity, she said.

"If we reach the maximum temperature and the minimum humidity, we're expecting continued erratic fire behavior," she added.

After advancing on the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir for several days, flames got close to the artificial lake on Tuesday. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission said there was little risk to the reservoir because of the rocky terrain and lack of brush surrounding it.

Officials said ash had drifted onto the surface of the reservoir, but testing of samples showed water quality remained healthy. If the water should become fouled by too much ash and soot and require filtration, it can be diverted through a treatment plant near San Francisco before being delivered to customers, officials from the commission said.

Most of the homes in the path of the fire have been ordered evacuated or were under advisories urging residents to leave voluntarily or be ready to flee at a moment's notice. The fire has already destroyed dozens of homes and cabins, but no serious injuries have been reported.

The cause of the blaze remained under investigation.

old student, whom the judge said seemed older than her age.

State District Judge G. Todd Baugh sentenced the teacher to 15 years in jail on Monday, then suspended all but 31 days of that term for the 2007 rape of Cherice Moralez, who killed herself in 2010, legal documents show. He also received credit for one day served.

In sentencing 54-year-old Stacey Rambold, the judge ignored a recommendation by prosecutors for a 20-year term with half of it suspended. Baugh described the girl as a troubled youth who "was probably as much in control of the situation" as was Rambold.

"We think the sentence is a travesty," said Marian Bradley, president of the state chapter of the National Organization for Women, adding that the group was seeking his resignation.

Referring to the judge, she added, "We think the man needs to be quiet before he endangers other women by suggesting they are to blame for being sexually assaulted."

The women's group expected hundreds of people to attend a silent protest near the judge's offices on Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, an online petition seeking Baugh's ouster had been signed by more than 13,000 people by Wednesday afternoon.

Baugh, who according to court transcripts also said before handing down the sentence that the girl seemed "older than her chronological age," did not immediately respond to several requests for comment.

Rambold was charged by Yellowstone County prosecutors in 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, the Montana equivalent of a rape charge, linked to Moralez, a student in a technology class he taught at Senior High School in Billings.

Moralez killed herself in 2010 before the case could go to trial. In an agreement with prosecutors later that year, Rambold admitted to a single count of sexual intercourse without consent and prosecutors agreed to postpone the case for three years and dismiss it entirely if Rambold completed sex offender treatment.

Prosecutors reinstated the case after being notified last year by the treatment center that Rambold, who was suspended in 2008 from his teaching post and later resigned, had been dismissed from the program for violating its rules.

In April, Rambold pleaded guilty to the rape charge stemming from the 2007 assault of Moralez in his Billings home, according to legal documents.

The girl's mother, Auliea Hanlon, had testified prior to sentencing that she wanted him put behind bars, saying she believed Rambold's actions were a "major factor" in her daughter's suicide.

"Cherice has paid for the consequences of his actions. He was on paid leave while she was being blamed and ostracized and ridiculed by her peers," she said. "He was as free as a bird while she was getting threatened and treated like trash every day."

Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito said he and his team of prosecutors were reviewing the sentencing - as they do in all such cases - with an eye toward any procedural or legal errors that might allow an appeal.

He said Hanlon, the girl's mother, was rightfully frustrated: "She is a victim in this as is her poor daughter, who is no longer with us."



headline: Colombia extradites top drug gang leader to U.S.

Colombia extradited Diego Perez Henao, one of the country's most wanted gang leaders, to the United States on Wednesday to face charges for alleged cocaine trafficking and involvement in hundreds of murders, Colombia's prison authority said.

Henao, who goes by the alias Diego Rastrojo, was handed over to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials under tight security at a military airport in Bogota, the Colombian capital, and put on a U.S.-bound plane.

One of the heads of the Rastrojos criminal gang, Henao was captured in Venezuela in June 2012, then deported home to Colombia. A $5 million bounty was offered for his capture.

News pictures showed Henao being escorted to the plane by Colombian police, handcuffed and wearing a blue "Los Angeles" polo shirt.

Colombia's five main criminal gangs, which have around 3,800 members, were mostly formed after the disbanding of right-wing paramilitary groups in 2006.

Many of the paramilitary units morphed into criminal gangs supplying cocaine to cartels in Mexico and the United States, making the arrest of their leaders a top priority for Washington in its battle against drug trafficking.

Colombia is one of the world's top cocaine producers, making around 300 tons a year even after U.S.-backed efforts to stamp out the illegal trade. The country's leftist guerrillas, the FARC and the smaller ELN group, levy taxes on local production of coca but deny involvement in trafficking the drug.

The coca leaf is the raw material used to make cocaine.

The government has been in peace negotiations with the FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, since last November. Both the FARC and ELN, or National Liberation Army, are considered terrorist organizations by the United States and European Union.

headline: Detroit can keep casino tax revenue, judge rules
byline: By Bernie Woodall and Joseph Lichterman
8:31am EDT

strapped Detroit can continue to access an estimated $11 million a month in casino tax revenue, a U.S. bankruptcy judge ruled on Wednesday, while the court takes up a deal with creditors related to the revenue.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy petition, ruled that bond insurer Syncora Guarantee Inc cannot block the city from using taxes paid by the city's three casinos.

Rhodes said Syncora does not have a lien on the money used as collateral since 2009 to secure Detroit's obligations on interest-rate swap agreements. Detroit entered into those agreements in conjunction with the sale of pension debt for its two retirement funds.

Sinking under more than $18 billion in debt and other obligations, Detroit on July 18 filed for the biggest Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Many bankruptcy experts believe the case may be a guide for what could happen when other U.S. cities file for Chapter 9 protection.

Detroit collects about $180 million annually from casinos, and around $15 million is deposited each month into accounts overseen by U.S. Bank to meet collateral requirements. The bank sets aside $4 million a month for quarterly payments to swap counterparties, leaving the city with about $11 million.

Syncora, which insured the swaps and some Detroit pension debt associated with the swaps, wanted to stop the city from accessing the casino revenue. That led Detroit to sue Syncora, claiming the insurer's action could derail an agreement in principle over the swaps. Rhodes put that lawsuit and other litigation on hold.

Detroit has asked Rhodes to approve a deal that could terminate the swaps, which were used to hedge interest-rate exposure on some of the pension debt, at a discounted rate of as much as 25 percent, saving the city more than $70 million. Monthly payments to swap counterparties from casino revenue would end if the swaps are terminated.

The deal, involving UBS AG and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, is the only one with creditors that has been publicly disclosed by Kevyn Orr, the state-appointed emergency manager running Detroit since March.

Syncora, other bond insurers, some owners of the pension debt, Detroit labor unions and others have filed various objections in court to the deal. The judge has ordered parties involved in the deal and many of the objectors to attend a mediation session scheduled for Thursday.

Ambac Assurance Corp, which insures about $170 million of Detroit general obligation bonds, said in its court filing the deal "cannot be deemed to be fair and equitable vis-à-vis the city's other creditors, because the city is overpaying one set of creditors at the expense of other similarly situated creditors."

In June, Orr determined the $1.4 billion of pension debt sold in 2005 and 2006 was unsecured and allowed a payment default, forcing Syncora to make a $24.7 million payment to bondholders. Orr, however, deemed the $300 million owed to swap counterparties was secured.

A hearing into the swaps agreement initially set for September 9 was pushed back on Wednesday by Rhodes to September 23 to allow attorneys for the multiple parties involved more time to prepare.

DIGITAL 'DATA ROOM'

Rhodes on Wednesday also allowed Detroit's legions of creditors access to critical financial data without having to agree not to disclose the information.

Some creditors, including a union representing city workers, had balked at being required to sign nondisclosure agreements in order to view 70,000 pages of financial information in a digital "data room."

Rhodes agreed to the city's plan to redact personal information such as Social Security numbers and home addresses from the documents. The data room would not be open to the public or news media.



headline: Zimmerman's wife 'stood by her man' in Florida perjury, lawyer says
byline: By Barbara Liston
8:31am EDT

George Zimmerman's wife, who pleaded guilty on Wednesday to perjury, was channeling hit country song "Stand by Your Man" when she lied to a Florida court about the couple's finances after Zimmerman's arrest for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, her lawyer said.

The lawyer, Kelly Sims, spoke to reporters after Shellie Zimmerman pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of perjury for lying in a bond hearing last year.

Shellie Zimmerman told the 2012 hearing the couple was essentially destitute, even though they had accumulated about $135,000 between them through contributions to an online legal defense fund, prosecutors said.

Circuit Judge Marlene Alva in Sanford accepted a deal in which Shellie Zimmerman agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor perjury rather than the original charge of felony perjury in an official proceeding.

She was ordered to serve one year of probation, perform 100 hours of community service and write a letter of apology to Judge Kenneth Lester, in whose court the perjury occurred.

Sims said Shellie Zimmerman was scared and caught off guard when she was asked in court about the couple's ability to make bond.

"So she stood by her man like Tammy Wynette," Sims said, referring to the singer's hit single "Stand by Your Man."

In her one-page apology to Judge Lester, Zimmerman acknowledged that she had lied in claiming that she and her husband were destitute.

"Over the last 16 months, I have become intimately aware of the justice system, and the absolute importance of all parties being truthful," she wrote in her letter to Lester.

George Zimmerman was acquitted in July of murder in Martin's death, but his wife still faced the perjury charge for telling Lester that they had no money at a bond hearing.

George Zimmerman was arrested last year, about six weeks after he shot Martin, who was walking to the townhouse where he was staying in the central Florida city of Sanford.

The case drew national attention to Florida's self-defense law, known as Stand Your Ground, while also sparking intense debate on racial profiling and equal justice for African-Americans.

The Zimmerman's family credit union accounts showed that Shellie Zimmerman had transferred more than $74,000 from her husband's account to her own during the five days before the bond hearing, an investigator with the state attorney's office wrote in an affidavit supporting her arrest.

The Zimmermans discussed the transfers in coded language in several phone calls recorded at the jail in the days preceding the bond hearing, the affidavit said. They also talked about moving money to Zimmerman's sister's account and about taking money from a safety deposit box, the affidavit said.

Words from the first black U.S. president and bell ringing around the world on Wednesday will mark 50 years to the minute that civil rights leader Martin Luther King ended his landmark "I have a dream" speech.

Capping a week long celebration of King's historic call for racial and economic justice, President Barack Obama will speak at the Lincoln Memorial, site of King's address on August 28, 1963.

The "Let Freedom Ring and Call to Action" ceremony comes as almost half of Americans say much more needs to be done before the color-blind society King envisioned is realized.

Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton also will address the crowd at the ceremony, which includes bell-ringing at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), 50 years to the minute after King ended his clarion call of the civil rights movement with the words "let freedom ring."

About 50 U.S. communities or organizations have said they will ring bells. The Swiss city of Lutry and Tokyo are also taking part, said Atlanta's King Center, one of the event's organizers.

Other organizers include the National Action Network of civil rights leader Al Sharpton, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Council of Churches. The ceremony follows an interfaith service at Shiloh Baptist Church in Washington, organizers said.

Obama's address will wrap up more than a week of Washington events around the anniversary. They included a march on Saturday that drew thousands of people urging action on jobs, voting rights and gun violence.

King, a black clergyman and advocate of non-violence, was among six organizers of the 1963 "March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom," where he made his address.

King's speech is credited with helping spur passage of sweeping civil rights laws. A white prison escapee assassinated the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1968.



headline: Colorado has safest drivers; DC's most likely to crash -report
byline: By Karen Brooks
8:31am EDT

The best drivers in the United States live in northern Colorado, while motorists on the crowded roadways of Washington, D.C., are twice as likely to crash as the national average, according to Allstate America's Best Drivers Report released this week.

Drivers in the nation's capital get involved in crashes once every 4.8 years on average, compared with a national average of once per decade. The most dangerous cities to drive in after Washington are Baltimore; Providence; Hialeah, Florida and Glendale, California.

New York drivers have crashes on average once every 7.3 years, while those in Chicago and Houston crash once every 8 years.

By way of comparison, the average driver in Fort Collins, Colorado, crashes every 13.9 years. The next-safest cities were Boise, Idaho; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Brownsville, Texas and Madison, Wisconsin.

The report, released Tuesday, surveyed Allstate insurance claims over 2011 and 2012 in 200 of the United States' largest cities to determine how often drivers there have crashes.

The company uses the two-year time frame in each annual report to mitigate any spikes in the numbers due to weather events or similar unusual influences on the statistics.

Allstate drivers make up about 10 percent of all insured motorists nationwide, the report said.

The report draws distinctions between driving in big cities, where traffic, emergencies, public transportation and simply getting lost pose more dangers, and small-town driving, where high speed limits, fewer crosswalks and large vehicles are among the most common threats.

Indeed, almost all of the 20 cities with the safest drivers have less than half a million residents, the largest of them Tucson, Arizona, with 524,000 residents and crashes happening to drivers about once every 11.4 years - similar to Lincoln, Nebraska, which is about half the size.

Larger or more crowded cities landed on the bottom of the list. The 20 least safe cities for drivers include Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Newark and Miami.



headline: Murderer Jodi Arias requests new venue in Arizona sentencing retrial
byline: By David Schwartz

boyfriend, is seeking a change of venue for a sentencing phase retrial in her high profile murder case, saying she could not get a fair hearing in the Phoenix area, court documents showed on Wednesday.

The former waitress from California was convicted in May of killing her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander, who was found dead in his shower in a Phoenix suburb in 2008, shot in the face and stabbed multiple times with his throat slashed.

But the same Maricopa County jury that found Arias guilty of murder deadlocked on whether she should be executed or sentenced to life in prison following a sensational trial that captured attention in the United States with its tale of a soft-spoken young woman accused of such a brutal crime.

The deadlock forced the judge to declare a penalty phase mistrial, and prosecutors are seeking to impanel a new jury for a sentencing retrial to determine her fate.

Lawyers for Arias, 33, said in a motion filed on Tuesday that the extensive media attention to the case in Maricopa County made it impossible for her to get a fair trial there, and asked for a change of venue to another Arizona county.

The motion described the publicity surrounding the trial, which was live-streamed on the internet, as "highly inflammatory with Ms. Arias frequently being referred to as a stalker, a liar, crazy and a seductress."

"It would be hard to argue that this publicity at issue did not create a circus-like atmosphere," attorney Kirk Nurmi argued in the brief, saying that 70 percent of the media coverage took place in Maricopa County.

According to Arizona law, prosecutors have the option of retrying the sentencing phase of the trial with a new jury to determine if Arias should be sentenced to death. If that jury deadlocks, a judge would sentence Arias to life in prison, or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.

Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery will continue to seek the death penalty for Arias, a spokesman said on Friday.

The judge presiding over the case, Sherry Stephens, said at a hearing last month that she hoped to start jury selection in September. But on Monday, she delayed setting a date to impanel a jury, instead setting another status hearing in the case for the middle of next month.

The initial five-month murder trial, which began in January, was packed with graphic testimony, bloody photographs and sexual situations. Arias took the stand for 18 days and maintained throughout that the killing was in self-defense despite fierce cross-examination by prosecutors.

Last month, Lance Batten was walking the trails around Berkeley Tuolumne Camp in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California, singing the familiar songs of his summertime refuge going back 26 years.

This week, the 62-year-old retired computer programmer sat in his Berkeley, California, home reflecting on the damage the monstrous fire inflicted in recent days when it destroyed a large swath of the timeless spot in the woods that Batten remembers so fondly.

He had taken his children to the camp when they were small and in July he brought his grandchildren.

"It's not just the memories. A piece of your life is wiped out and gone," Batten said in a telephone interview. "No matter what happens it will never be the same."

The so-called Rim Fire, which has burned nearly 184,500 acres, continues to push into Yosemite National Park while threatening 4,500 homes along its northwestern flank. As of Tuesday night, it was 20 percent contained.

In addition to ravaging the Berkeley Tuolumne Family Camp, it has also claimed at least one cabin in Camp Tawonga, a Jewish camp about 8 miles north inside the Stanislaus National Forest.

The structures of other nearby camps remain untouched by the blaze, the Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office spokesman, Sergeant Scott Johnson, said on Tuesday.

But at the Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, most of the buildings - which include 72 tent-top cabins and a communal dining hall - have been destroyed, said Berkeley city spokesman Matthai Chakko. The 91-year-old, heavily-wooded camp was a summertime refuge for families across northern California, and particularly for residents of Berkeley, who enjoyed priority in reserving space there, Chakko said.

The camp had been fully booked for the rest of the summer, Chakko noted, and its occupants were evacuated five days before the fire came.

Faring better but still not out of danger was Camp Tawonga, which caters to both secular and religious Jewish youth and has occupied its 160 acres since 1964.

The camp's primary season ended shortly before the fire, so only six staff members were forced to flee, taking with them the camp's decades-old Torah scroll - the Jewish holy text - which survived the Holocaust. Also evacuated was a tome dating to the 1980s in which campers recorded their summertime memories.

Camp Tawonga, most of whose buildings sit on a meadow that is more easily defended by firefighters than are woodlands, lost one cabin in the blaze. The extent of the damage to other parts of the camp, including its garden and arts-and-crafts area, is not known, said camp director Jamie Simon.

"We feel cautiously optimistic," Simon said in a telephone interview. "We're grateful to the firefighters for all the work they've done so far."

headline: California governor proposes $315 million plan to ease prison overcrowding
byline: By Dan Whitcomb
8:31am EDT

California Governor Jerry Brown, facing a federal court order to ease overcrowding in the state's prison system, proposed a $315 million plan on Tuesday to expand inmate capacity by leasing space from county jails and other facilities.

The Democratic governor, who was joined by Republican leaders of the state legislature in announcing the bill, said his proposal would reduce California's prisons to 137.5 percent of capacity, as required by the court, and avoid the controversial early release of thousands of inmates.

He is seeking passage of the bill in the California legislature which would allocate funding.

"This legislation will protect public safety and give us time to work with public officials and interested parties to make thoughtful changes in the overall criminal justice system," Brown said in a written statement.

After years of litigation, a specially appointed panel of three appellate judges ruled in 2009 that California's prisons can exceed their design capacity but set a specific cap on the inmate population that would force the state to either find new homes for some 10,000 prisoners or let them go.

Frustrated with the slow pace of the state's response, the three judges have twice threatened Brown with contempt.

Earlier this month the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a petition for a stay of that order by state prison officials, who argued that they were working to meet the population target by December 31 but that doing so could be costly and pose a risk to public safety.

Though Brown's joint appearance with Republican leaders and Democratic Assembly Speaker John Perez suggested bipartisan support for his plan, Senate President pro tem Darrell Steinberg took immediate issue with the bill.

'NO PROMISE, NO HOPE'

"The governor's proposal is a plan with no promise and no hope. As the population of California grows, it's only a short matter of time until new prison cells overflow and the Court demands mass releases again," Steinberg said in a written statement.

"More money for more prison cells alone is not a durable solution; it is not a fiscally responsible solution; and it is not a safe solution," he said. "We must invest in a durable criminal justice strategy, which reduces both crime and prison overcrowding."

According to the governor's office, his plan would allocate $315 million for the state to "expeditiously" lease in-state and out-of-state prison capacity, including at county jails and private facilities.

Brown's proposal comes as new attention is being focused on California prisons during a hunger strike by inmates to protest conditions in special housing units where some prisoners are held for prolonged periods in isolation.

The protest is the third and largest hunger strike staged by inmates over solitary confinement in the last two years.

State officials deny the inmates' claims of inhumane conditions, saying that some prisoners have cell mates, are permitted visits and have access to a law library.

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation last week won a court order allowing them to force feed some of the prisoners taking part in the hunger strike, although officials said there was no immediate need to do so.

byline: By Paul Eckert and Eric M. Johnson

The United States will send its North Korean human rights envoy to Pyongyang this week to seek the release of an imprisoned and ailing U.S. Christian missionary, the State Department said on Tuesday.

Robert King, special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, will travel to Pyongyang on Friday at the invitation of the government on a "humanitarian mission focused on securing the release of U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae," the department said in a statement.

King will ask North Korea to "pardon Mr. Bae and grant him special amnesty on humanitarian grounds so that he can be reunited with his family and seek medical treatment," it added.

The White House urged North Korea on Tuesday to grant Bae, who suffers diabetes among other conditions, clemency and allow him to return to the United States.

Asked about his mission, King told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday that Bae had health problems.

"We're hopeful that we'll be able to make progress on that," he said.

King was visiting Tokyo ahead of his Pyongyang trip to meet with senior Japanese government officials and lawmakers including Keiji Furuya, minister in charge of issues related to the abductions of Japanese citizens by North Korea.

The release of Bae, which would remove an irritant in U.S. relations with North Korea, also would fit into a recent pattern of conciliatory steps by Pyongyang toward its neighbors.

In April, Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after North Korea's Supreme Court convicted him of state subversion. The court said Bae, 45, used his tourism business to form groups aimed at overthrowing the government.

Bae was detained in November as he led a tour group through the northern region of the country. His sentencing came amid acrimonious relations between Pyongyang and Washington over the reclusive state's nuclear program.

Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told Reuters on August 10 that her brother had been held at a prison for foreigners and put to work plowing and planting fields.

He was transferred to a state hospital because he suffered from a range of health problems, including an enlarged heart, chronic diabetes as well as back and leg pain, she said.

North Korea has used the release of high-profile American prisoners as a means of garnering prestige or recognition, rather than economic gain, by portraying visiting dignitaries as paying homage to the country and its leader.

That pattern has complicated the response from U.S. lawmakers and the State Department, which has called for Bae's immediate release on "humanitarian grounds," but had resisted sending high-profile envoys to negotiate.

Reports last month that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was set to visit North Korea to negotiate for Bae were denied.

In an Internet petition urging President Barack Obama to secure "special amnesty" for his father, Jonathan Bae wrote: "We have been distraught by my father's deteriorating health and his sentence of hard labor. However, we have not given up hope because we have faith in our government to represent and protect American citizens here and abroad."

King has experience negotiating in the reclusive state, which has sought to use imprisoned foreigners as high-profile bargaining chips.

Jun Young Su, an American citizen detained in North Korea on unspecified charges for six months, was released during a May 2011 visit by King to assess its pleas for food aid.

Jun was arrested and admitted committing a crime "against the state" following an investigation, North Korea's official KCNA news agency reported. Media reports said the California businessman had been doing missionary work in North Korea, which said he would be released on "humanitarian grounds."

Two American journalists arrested in 2009 by North Korea were held until former President Bill Clinton traveled there to negotiate their release.

"Many people will read too much into. What we've seen over the decades is that North Korea alternates between belligerent threats and even aggressive actions and charm offensives," said Bruce Klingner, a Senior Research Fellow for Northeast Asia at The Heritage Foundation.

In dispatching King, rather than a more prominent diplomat or former U.S. president, the State Department weighed the well-being of a citizen against gestures that might undermine its policy toward a bellicose state, Klingner said.

Earlier this year, North Korea threatened to stage nuclear attacks on the United States, among other military actions.

Rick Larsen, a U.S. congressman from Washington state, where Bae's family lives, has called for Bae's release.

"Kenneth's family has waited in anguish and uncertainty, but has never wavered in their tireless advocacy on his behalf," Larsen said in a statement.

The review panel is part of an effort to expand oversight of the programs, which Obama has defended as necessary to protect national security.

Its members are Richard Clarke, a former counterterrorism adviser in the Clinton and Bush White Houses; Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA; Peter Swire, who worked on technology issues in the Obama and Clinton administrations; Geoffrey Stone, a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago, where Obama worked before entering politics; and Cass Sunstein, Obama's former regulatory czar who is married to Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

The group will present interim findings in 60 days to the director of national intelligence, the White House said. They are expected to give a final report and recommendations to Obama by the end of the year.

Earlier this month, Obama also said he would work with Congress to reform laws that govern the collection of phone records and add scrutiny to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

He also said he wanted to provide more information to the public about the surveillance programs to restore trust.



headline: Measles-like virus may be cause of dolphin deaths on U.S. coast
byline: By Environment Correspondent Deborah Zabarenko
8:31am EDT

like virus that suppresses the immune system could be the reason an extraordinary number of bottlenose dolphins have died after becoming stranded along the U.S. East Coast, a panel of dolphin experts said on Tuesday.

Since July 1, 333 bottlenose dolphins have been found dead along coastlines from New York to North Carolina, the highest number in a quarter-century and almost 10 times the average of 33 for the same period and region over the last five years, according to Teri Rowles of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Virginia has had the largest number of stranded dolphin deaths, with 174, Rowles said in a telephone briefing.

The death toll is likely higher because there have been reports of dolphin carcasses floating off the East Coast, particularly in Virginia.

Rowles and other experts from NOAA, universities and marine institutes have tentatively attributed the deaths to cetacean morbillivirus, which is related to the virus that causes measles in humans.

Morbillivirus attacks dolphins' immune systems, leaving infected animals thin and vulnerable to other diseases, including pneumonia. Many of the stranded dolphins have lesions on their skin, mouths, joints or lungs, NOAA reported.

Different kinds of morbillivirus stay within a closely related species and there is no indication this outbreak could jump to people, said Jerry Saliki of the University of Georgia.

This kind of dolphin die-off has not occurred in the mid-Atlantic region since 1987-1988. If this outbreak follows a similar course, it could last until May 2014 as dolphin populations build up resistance to the virus, Rowles said.

NOAA has declared an Unusual Mortality Event, which offers support for bottlenose dolphins in this area under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act.

NO DOLPHIN VACCINE

"At this point, there isn't anything to stop the virus," Rowles said. While there are vaccines against morbillivirus that occurs in land animals, there is no vaccine that could be easily deployed to populations of dolphins, she said.

This month, NOAA declared an Unusual Mortality Event for bottlenose dolphins in Florida's Indian River Lagoon, where dolphin strandings are nearly three times the historic average this year. The agency did not offer a tentative cause for these deaths, but many of the dolphin carcasses in Florida were emaciated.

"There is a tipping point in populations," Stephanie Venn-Watson of the National Marine Mammal Foundation said. "The primary hypothesis is East Coast dolphins don't have the natural immune response to fight off the virus."

Asked whether pollution could be a factor, Rowles said experts are monitoring an area off Georgia where there are high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in the water. PCBs were banned in the United States in 1979, but they can remain at manufacturing sites for decades and are known carcinogens, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

No stranded dolphins have been reported along the Georgia coast, but that could change as the dolphins migrate south for the winter.

headline: Denver seeks 3.5 percent tax on sales of marijuana
byline: By Keith Coffman
8:31am EDT

The city of Denver, in a first step toward regulating newly legal recreational marijuana, will ask voters to approve a 3.5 percent sales tax on pot sales in a citywide ballot measure in November, a city official said on Tuesday.

The municipal sales tax, if approved at the polls, would be on top of a proposed 25 percent sales and excise tax that voters statewide will also be asked to adopt in November to fund the regulation and enforcement of non-medical cannabis use.

"We are breaking new ground, and the country is watching us," Denver City Council President Mary Beth Susman said on Tuesday, the morning after the council voted 11-1 to approve placement of the city tax measure on the ballot.

Last fall, Colorado and Washington became the first U.S. states to legalize the possession and use of small amounts of pot for recreational purposes, and both states are still working out how to regulate the sale and marketing of the drug, which is classified as an illegal narcotic under federal law.

Nearly two dozen states also allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Susman said Denver officials have not received any input from the U.S. Department of Justice as it carries out the will of Colorado voters.

"I think the federal government is waiting to see how tightly we can regulate this," she said, adding that Denver lawmakers next month will take up specific proposed ordinances on the licensing of marijuana shops.

Under the Colorado law, local governments can opt out of allowing cannabis stores in their jurisdictions. More than 50 municipalities have banned retail pot shops while nearly two dozen have imposed moratoriums on the shops, according to figures from the Colorado Municipal League.

Last month, he state's second-largest city, Colorado Springs, barred retail pot shops, but its medical marijuana shops are unaffected.

Denver officials estimate the proposed sales tax would add $3.4 million annually to the city's coffers, which would go toward enforcement and public health programs.



headline: Zimmerman lawyer expects Florida to be stingy about legal costs
byline: By Barbara Liston
8:31am EDT

The attorney for George Zimmerman said Tuesday he expects to recover from the state no more than a fraction of the defense expenses, despite his client's acquittal in July on murder charges in the death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.

Attorney Mark O'Mara is planning to seek reimbursement from the state for defense costs estimated at $200,000 to $300,000, but expects to receive $50,000 or less because of limitations on what the state can approve.

"I just think it's patently unfair that the state by overcharging a case they could not prove at trial gets to cost either Mr. Zimmerman, or me, or the donors a whole bunch of money that they're not responsible for," O'Mara said at a news conference.

Prosecutors contended that Zimmerman profiled Martin who was walking to the townhouse where he was staying in the central Florida city of Sanford in February 2012. The former neighborhood watch volunteer shot Martin during a confrontation, and told police he acted in self-defense.

The case drew national attention to Florida's self-defense law, known as Stand Your Ground, while also sparking intense debate on racial profiling and equal justice for African-Americans.

The sum sought by O'Mara does not include his standard fee, which he said in this case would have totaled about $1 million for 16 months' work, or the fees of other lawyers on the defense team, all of whom worked for free. O'Mara said the state's Judicial Administrative Commission rules on reimbursement requests.

Some of the Zimmerman's defense expenses, particularly fees for expert witnesses, remain unpaid. Some defense costs and Zimmerman's living expenses were paid by donors who gave $314,000 as of January through a defense website.

frisk" policy backed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin deemed the crime-fighting tactic unconstitutional because it targeted racially defined groups.

She also ordered the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee several reforms, including a trial program for police to use body cameras.

Her remedies addressed lawsuits brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.

The city is appealing her decision to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

In a letter dated on Tuesday, it said her decision was "rife with errors of law" that could be corrected on appeal, where the remedies she ordered could be overturned.

"Implementation of the broad-sweeping panoply of remedies based on such errors are likely to cause irreparable harm to defendants and the public safety," city lawyers Heidi Grossman and Linda Donahue wrote in the letter.

The city added that implementing the body camera pilot project "poses significant harm in terms of time, resources and possible impingement on privacy rights of the public."

Bloomberg has defended stop-and-frisk, saying it has helped drastically reduce crime during his nearly 12-year tenure.

The cases are David Floyd et al v. The City of New York, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-1034; and Ligon v. The City of New York, in the same court, 12-2274.

headline: Boston mayor reaches deal for Caesars casino at horse racetrack
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

Boston Mayor Thomas Menino reached a proposed deal with developers on Tuesday to build a $1 billion Caesars casino in the city's East Boston section that he said would generate at least $32 million in annual revenue for the city and create thousands of jobs.

The pact, expected since casinos were legalized in 2011, also includes an up-front payment of $33.4 million to East Boston and allows the Suffolk Downs horse racetrack, where the casino will be built, to continue to operate, the mayor said in a statement.

A referendum on the deal will be held within 60 to 90 days in East Boston, an outlying part of the city located across Boston Harbor past the city's airport.

"I have said from the start of this process that I wanted three things: a first-class, resort destination casino, an agreement that would benefit the people of East Boston, and a proposal that will be selected by the State Gaming Commission," said Menino, who is in the last year of a 20-year tenure as mayor. "We are well on our way to that and more."

Massachusetts legalized casino gambling in 2011. Lawmakers carved the state up into three districts, and allotted one casino license to each. Suffolk Downs, the only thoroughbred horse racing venue in New England, has been seen as the front-runner for the Boston-area license in a competition with rival Wynn Resorts, which has proposed a casino outside the city, in Everett.

About eight projects are vying for the three licenses, though none have yet won final approval.

The racetrack would join forces with casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp and build a Caesars-branded resort at Suffolk Downs that includes a casino, hotel, restaurants and retail outlets.

The deal provides for 4,000 permanent jobs, 2,500 construction jobs during the building of the facility, 2,225 jobs during an early opening period and 800 permanent jobs for a year before the early opening.

Under the deal, Boston would receive an estimated $52 million annually, with a guaranteed minimum of $32 million per year, Menino said.

Suffolk Downs has committed to spend $50 million annually on goods and services in Boston and $5 million in East Boston alone. It also would spend at least $45 million on roads, bridges, subway station improvements, bike lanes and ferry transportation.

The project would include two gaming areas, two luxury hotels with a total of 450 rooms, meeting and entertainment space, restaurants, retail space and a seven-story parking garage.



headline: Fort Hood gunman rests case without making statement
byline: By Ellen Wulfhorst
8:31am EDT

U.S. Army Major Nidal Hasan, facing the possibility of a death sentence for the November 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, rested his case without making a statement in the sentencing phase of his trial on Tuesday.

The jury of 13 military officers, who convicted the Army psychiatrist of killing 13 people and wounding 31 others, was instructed to return to court on Wednesday, when it will likely begin deliberating Hasan's sentence. Most of those killed and wounded were unarmed soldiers.

Given the opportunity to address the jury before the deliberations begin, Hasan declined to make any statement nor present any evidence in his defense.

"The defense rests," said Hasan, who has acted as his own attorney.

The most he has said in court was in his opening statement on August 6, when he admitted to being the gunman at the central Texas Army base and said he had switched sides in what he considered to be a U.S. war on Islam.

Standby defense attorneys for Hasan attempted to present so-called mitigating evidence that could be used to argue for a life sentence rather than the death penalty. That included details on his background, family life, education, military experience and logs of his behavior in jail.

"If no one makes a case for life, there is only death," said Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, one of the attorneys assigned to Hasan's case.

But Hasan objected to the effort on his behalf, telling Judge Colonel Tara Osborn he had "overzealous defense counsel."

The judge ruled in Hasan's favor, saying he should be allowed to control his side of the case.

"Major Hasan is the captain of his own ship," the judge said after repeatedly reminding Hasan that he could mount a stronger defense of his life.

"It is my free and voluntary decision," he told the judge at one point.

An American-born Muslim, Hasan earlier told mental health evaluators he wanted to become a martyr, and lawyers assisting him have said he was actively seeking the death penalty.

Hasan, 42, has disputed that claim.

The discussions about Hasan making little or no effort to argue for his life took place without the jury present.

Seated in a wheelchair, Hasan was bearded and wearing a camouflage Army uniform. He frequently rubbed his forehead and spent much of his time thumbing through court papers on the table in front of him.

He uses the wheelchair after being paralyzed when shot by police to end the rampage at the U.S. Army base, just weeks before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan.

The military jury convicted him on Friday of 45 counts of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder in what was the deadliest mass murder ever at a U.S. military base. The same jury can now sentence him to death or to life in prison.

Twenty family members and victims gave evidence during the prosecution's side of the sentencing phase. The prosecution concluded its case earlier on Tuesday.

Joleen Cahill, testified that she and her three children have struggled with emotional, health and work issues since the death of her husband, retired Chief Warrant Officer Michael Cahill, 62, an employee at Fort Hood. The couple had been married for 37 years.

One night, the widow said, she found herself having a thought that she described as one "you shouldn't have," without elaborating, and realized: "I need to start fighting back."

"The shooting is not going to destroy my life or my children's. He is not going to win. I am in control," she said.

If the jury unanimously recommends death as his punishment, Hasan could face lethal injection, possibly making him the first U.S. soldier to be executed by the U.S. military since 1961.

A death sentence would mean the start of a lengthy process requiring the approval of the Fort Hood commanding general, and the U.S. president, in order for there to be an execution.



headline: California wildfire burns deeper into Yosemite National Park
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

summer visitors, while the sprawling blaze also crept closer to thousands of homes west of the park.

The so-called Rim Fire, which has burned for 11 days mainly in the Stanislaus National Forest west of Yosemite, nearly doubled its footprint in the park overnight after encroaching on a reservoir that serves as the primary water supply for San Francisco some 200 miles to the west.

Officials said some ash from the fire had drifted onto the surface of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, but testing of samples taken from the artificial lake showed that water quality remained healthy.

If the water should become fouled by too much ash and soot and require filtration, it can be diverted through a treatment plant near San Francisco before being delivered to customers, officials from the city Public Utilities Commission said.

Meanwhile, a firefighting force of some 3,700 personnel, backed by teams of bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters, continued to make headway in their drive to encircle and suppress the flames.

By late on Monday, containment lines had been established around 20 percent of the fire's perimeter, nearly triple Sunday's figure, though the overall area of the blaze continued to grow as much of the firefighting effort focused on structure protection.

"We are making progress," Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said on Tuesday, adding that fire managers were looking forward to a cooling trend forecast for the end of the week. "That would bring some much-needed relief," he said.

The blaze was among the fastest-moving of dozens of large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West.

More favorable weather this week in the Pacific Northwest, including lower temperatures, diminished winds and even some rain, has helped firefighters gain an upper hand on a number of stubborn blazes in Oregon and Washington state.

Those gains have, in turn, freed up some fire crews and other thinly stretched resources, leading federal fire managers to lower the nation's wildfire threat index a notch.

"Things are really getting rosier," said Ken Frederick, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center, a support center for wildland firefighting, in Boise.

BUFFER ZONES AROUND HOMES

The Rim Fire has charred nearly 180,000 acres - an area larger than the land mass of Chicago - since it erupted August 17, most of that in the Stanislaus Forest, Berlant said.

It ranks as the biggest California wildfire since October 2007, when the Witch Fire torched nearly 198,000 acres and more than 1,600 structures in San Diego County, and the sixth-largest in state history, according to the records of Cal Fire, a state government site.

Firefighters hacking through dense, dry brush and trees to create clearings in the rugged terrain rushed on Tuesday to improve buffer zones around some 4,500 homes threatened by the blaze on its northwestern flank, Berlant said.

Most of those dwellings have been ordered evacuated or were under advisories urging residents to leave voluntarily or be ready to flee at a moment's notice. The fire has already destroyed dozens of homes and cabins, Berlant said, but no serious injuries have been reported.

As of Tuesday morning, the blaze had scorched nearly 42,000 acres of Yosemite - almost double the number from late Monday, forcing the closure of some campgrounds in the more remote northern part of the park and the main entrance road from the San Francisco Bay area. (<a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>)

The vast majority of the 1,200-square-mile park, including the Yosemite Valley area renowned for its towering rock formations, waterfalls, meadows and pine forests, remained open to the public and free of smoke. But late-summer crowds were notably diminished, park officials said.

"There are still people here, but there's definitely fewer visiting than there normally would be for this time of year, and that just happened within the last couple of days," park spokeswoman Kari Cobb told Reuters. "It's just the northern part of the park is smoky."

The Rim Fire, named for a Stanislaus National Forest lookout point called Rim of the World, has already damaged two of the three hydropower generating stations, linked to the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, that supply electricity for all of San Francisco's public facilities, such as hospitals and firehouses.

The city has been drawing on reserve power stored for emergencies and purchasing additional electricity on the open market to make up for the difference.

The fire also ravaged a 91-year-old summer camp operated by the Bay-area city of Berkeley - the Tuolumne Berkeley Family Camp - west of the Yosemite on Sunday, days after a nearby Jewish camp called Camp Tawonga was damaged.

The cause of the blaze remained under investigation.

headline: Judge speeds hearing on Detroit bankruptcy eligibility
byline: By Joseph Lichterman
8:31am EDT

The federal judge overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy filing is accelerating the already hurried process of determining whether the city is eligible for protection from its creditors.

Judge Steven Rhodes ordered late Monday that initial oral arguments in the case begin on September 18, well ahead of the October 23 date he originally scheduled for the start of the trial on the issue of eligibility.

Detroit filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history on July 18. Kevyn Orr, Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, has said he wants the city to be out of bankruptcy court by the time his term as emergency manager is scheduled to end in the fall of 2014.

Monday's order was the latest sign that Rhodes wants to set an aggressive timetable to move the city through bankruptcy court.

"A prompt oral argument on these legal issues will promote just, speedy and efficient determination of the city's eligibility to be a debtor" under the bankruptcy code, Rhodes wrote on Monday.

Rhodes also said he would delay hearing objections to the bankruptcy that center on potential cuts to retiree pensions, which unions and retiree groups argue are protected by the Michigan state constitution.

The judge wrote in his order that he "appreciates the extraordinary importance of the pension rights," but he will not consider arguments about potential cuts to pensions until after he decides whether the city is eligible for bankruptcy.

The eligibility argument will center on whether Detroit is insolvent, whether the city negotiated in good faith with its creditors, or whether there were too many creditors to make negotiations feasible.

The bankruptcy code requires only that Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, prove that the city is insolvent, Rhodes wrote, adding that the city does not need to "prove that any particular plan that it might later propose is confirmable."

Bill Nowling, Orr's spokesman, said Tuesday that delaying a decision on the pension funds until the city has filed a restructuring plan with the court was appropriate.

"We think the judge is absolutely right to say that that's a plan of adjustment issue and should be litigated during that phase of the proceedings."

Laura Bartell, a law professor and bankruptcy expert at Wayne State University in Detroit, said the judge's decision to postpone discussion of the pension issues was "logical."

In a June 14 report to the city's creditors, Orr said unsecured creditors, including pension funds, will receive a pro rata share of $2 billion of notes the city would issue and pay off as its financial circumstances improve.

City workers and retirees would also face changes to their pensions and health care coverage "consistent with available funding," Orr said at the time, which was before the city filed for bankruptcy.

Creditors filed 109 objections to the city's bankruptcy before the deadline last week. In their objections, unions and the city's two public pension funds made similar arguments, claiming a bankruptcy filing will lead to an unconstitutional reduction in retirement benefits.

The September 18 hearing will be used to hear arguments on legal issues in the case raised by city labor unions and others, including the constitutionality of Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy and of the Michigan law that allowed the city to file for bankruptcy.

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 25, in its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Detroit, argued that Chapter 9 encroaches on states' rights.

AFSCME, as well as the United Auto Workers and the city's two retirement systems, also claimed that the state law Gov. Rick Snyder used to appoint Orr violated the state constitution.

AFSCME's Ed McNeil, the chief negotiator for a coalition of 33 unions that represent most of the service workers for the city, said in a statement that the union is concerned about the hasty schedule.

McNeil added that "the order does not prohibit us from making constitutional arguments or arguments about the pensions at the September 18 hearing."

Arguments objecting to the underlying facts in the case, such as whether the city negotiated with creditors in good faith, will be heard on October 23, as originally planned.

AFSCME and the organizations representing retired Detroit police officers and firefighters also argued that Detroit has not proven it is insolvent and has not negotiated in good faith with its creditors.



headline: Four thousand run from the bulls in Virginia event
byline: By Gary Robertson
8:31am EDT

mile dirt track on Saturday in rural Virginia's version of the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain.

It was the first event of what promoters say will be a nationwide, 10-city bull-running tour modeled on the annual Pamplona event.

"I just didn't want to die, to get trampled by bulls and die," said Cat Brown, 22, who works in engineering and traveled from New York City for the run.

"It was a rush ... a shot of adrenalin," she said.

Brown had such a thrill dodging bulls and watching them race by at break-neck speed that she paid $30 to run again in the afternoon.

The first six runs were conducted with about 500 runners each, chased by 12 bulls, and the last run featured 24 bulls chasing about 700 runners.

About 8,000 people came to watch the runs, said Rob Dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of the Boston-based Great Bull Run. Most of those who signed up were 18 to 40 years old, and about 40 percent were women.

At least one runner suffered an injury that required a trip to a hospital. Another went to see a medic after being knocked down and stepped on by other runners.

Every participant in the race had to sign a waiver, absolving the organizers of liability should they be injured.

Dickens said it was "doing something dangerous and living to tell the tale" that draws participants to the event.

That was what drew Laurie Blaha, 27, of Richmond, Virginia. "I wanted to test myself," she said.

Blaha said she passed the test, conquering the fear and nervousness she had before the bulls ran onto the track.

"It was exhilarating," Blaha said. "I would definitely do it again."

Dickens said the only major problem came on the first run of the day, when the initial group of six bulls stopped about midway down the quarter-mile dirt course.

They didn't start running again until six additional bulls were let out of the gates. Dickens said they apparently didn't have the confidence to run alone, and needed more company.

After that, he said the staff overseeing the bulls began sending 12 bulls at a time.

In nearly all the runs held during the day, the bulls started slowly and then quickly accelerated to a stampede-like pace.

The Virginia run was set on the grounds of the Virginia Motorsport Park, a drag strip south of Richmond that offered spectators State Fair food such as fried Oreos and foot-long corn dogs.

Animals rights groups, such as PETA, have protested the Great Bull Run, saying the events puts stress on the animals.

Dickens has said the bulls are not harmed and has invited anyone observing someone abusing the animals to report it.

The next Great Bull Run is scheduled for October 19 in Atlanta. Other cities on the nationwide tour include Houston, Tampa and Los Angeles.

old graffiti artist who died after being shocked by a stun gun during a police chase earlier this month sued the city of Miami Beach on Tuesday for damages, alleging use of excessive force.

Israel Hernandez-Llach died on August 6 after police shocked him with a Taser as he ran away from officers who caught him spray-painting the wall of a shuttered McDonald's.

The lawsuit filed on Tuesday in Miami-Dade County court alleges that Miami Beach Police Department officers allegedly used "unnecessary, excessive and unconstitutional force" including the use of a Taser on Hernandez Llach.

Noting that the young, Colombian-born artist was slightly built and not carrying a weapon "officers had no reasonable basis to fear for their own safety or the safety of the public," the suit asserted. It also said officers celebrated by high-fiving one another as the victim lay on the ground dead or dying.

As a result "emergency medical attention was withheld with reckless disregard for the life and safety" of Hernandez-Llach, according to the complaint.

"A Taser is a weapon, a weapon that inflicts excruciating, incapacitating pain on the subject. It carries with it a risk of serious injury and death," Todd McPharlin, an Hernandez-Llach family lawyer, told reporters.

He spoke on the steps of a county courthouse joined by members of the family wearing black and holding hands. Israel's mother, Jacqueline Llach, began crying after he started speaking.

The family is seeking undisclosed damages. Attorneys for the family say Hernandez-Llach would likely not have been prosecuted over the spray-painting and would have probably faced a punishment of community service for a second degree misdemeanor.

Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez, who is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, has said that Hernandez-Llach was confronted by officers after vandalizing private property and ignored their commands to stop running.

He said Jorge Mercado, the officer who shocked the young artist with the Taser, acted according to policy in dealing with someone who had resisted arrest.

Once in custody, Hernandez-Llach, who was known as "Reefa" and whose work had appeared in some Miami art galleries, showed signs of medical distress and was pronounced dead soon after, according to police statements.

A formal cause of death has not been established in the case pending toxicology results.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is conducting an independent review of the police investigation into the death.

Florida's state attorney and the medical examiner for Miami-Dade County are also reviewing the case, officials said.

The Hernandez-Llach family also accuse Martinez and the city of failing to properly train and discipline the police officers involved.

Miami Beach police have come under scrutiny in recent years for a series of shootings and improper conduct, including the death of a 22-year-old man who was shot 16 times by police two years ago during a Memorial Day weekend hip-hop festival.

duty fight in a men's room in 2007.

He was also accused along with three other officers of falsely arresting and tasing two New York tourists in their Miami Beach hotel room in 2008. That case was closed after the two alleged victims withdrew their complaint due to lack of witness testimony, according to police records.



headline: Entergy to shut controversial Vermont nuclear plant
byline: By Eileen O'Grady and Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

Entergy Corp will shut the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, citing high costs tied to regulation and competition from cheap natural gas, bringing to an end a long battle with politicians and environmentalists seeking to close it.

Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin welcomed the news that the 40-year-old plant, which generates three-quarters of the state's power, will cease operations by the end of 2014, though the closure raises new problems for the New England state, including how long it would take to clean up the site.

Entergy's move came just two weeks after a federal appeals court largely sided with the company in its fight to prevent Vermont from shutting down the only nuclear power plant in the state and one of four in New England.

Opposition to the Vernon, Vermont, plant has grown over the years, most recently focusing on a January 2010 disclosure of a leak of radioactive tritium. Still, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted the plant a 20-year operating license in 2011 that would have kept it running until March 2032.

But Leo Denault, Entergy's chief executive since February, said in an interview with Reuters that the plant was no longer economically viable due to a combination of rising capital costs after the September 11 attacks, Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster and low wholesale electricity prices stemming from cheap natural gas burned by competing plants.

"We did everything we could to keep the plant open," he said, praising the 600 employees for operating the plant even when "they did not feel welcome in the state."

Opponents of the plant were quick to voice their approval.

"This is not a big surprise to me and I don't think it's a big surprise to many who follow the economics of aging nuclear power plants," Shumlin, Vermont's Democratic Governor who led the state's fight to have the plant shut down when its initial operating permit expired in 2012, told reporters.

Marvin Fertel, chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Institute said in a statement that the shut down was "a great loss to the state of Vermont, the regional economy and consumers, and the environment."

REGULATION, COMPETITION

The Fukushima meltdowns and radioactive contamination led regulators to review safety standards, which could lead to requirements for costly plant improvements, a decade after 9/11 prompted heavy spending to tighten security around plants.

Surging output of shale gas, which sent natural gas prices to 10-year lows in 2012, has also weighed on the nuclear industry. Last October, Dominion Resources Inc's Kewaunee plant in Wisconsin became the first nuclear plant to be closed due to cheap gas prices after hundreds of coal-fired plants had shut.

Natural gas-fired plants now account for more than half New England's energy supply, according to the region's grid operator.

With Vermont Yankee, a total of five U.S. nuclear plants have shut or will shut before their licenses expire.

Denault said Entergy is open to a settlement with New York State officials over the future of its controversial Indian Point nuclear plant, which is near New York City.

Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a local advocacy group which has been lobbying for Yankee's closure since the 1970s, said it felt vindicated by Entergy's decision.

"It represented a risk would could not afford for power we don't need," VPIRG Executive Director Paul Burns said in a statement.

Vermont's total energy consumption is the lowest in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In 2011, three-quarters of its power generation came from nuclear power, with another 21 percent from hydroelectric power.

Closure of the plant will probably not have a large impact on natural gas markets, Thomson Reuters analyst Reza Haidari said, estimating it would boost U.S. natural gas consumption by less than 0.01 percent.

Entergy said it will take an after-tax impairment charge of about $181 million in the third quarter due to the retirement of the plant, the smallest that it owns, and expects further charges of $55 million to $60 million related to future severance and other costs through the end of next year.

The New Orleans-based company said the shutdown would modestly benefit its operational earnings, excluding special items, within two years, with cash flow expected to increase about $150 million to $200 million through 2017.

Shares of the U.S. power company were little changed, down 26 cents to $62.81 per share on the New York Stock Exchange.

LONG CLEANUP AHEAD

Entergy's decision to close the plant leaves Vermont with the question of what to do with the site, located in the rural state's southeast corner, near New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

It could be some time before the site is available for other uses, warned energy specialist Christopher Russo of Charles River Associates in Boston.

"It's probably on the order of 50 years before it goes back to being a green field site," Russo said. "There's nowhere to move the nuclear fuel at this point."

That said, he noted, one of the greatest assets in a decommissioned nuclear power plant is its connection to the electrical grid, which could make the site attractive to a utility looking to install another style of generator.

"The grids were almost built around these plants," Russo said.

While Vermont officials have long fought to close the plant, area residents had an uneasy peace with it.

Fana Cyr, a 37-year-old builder from Hinsdale, New Hampshire, across the Connecticut River from the plant, said he was glad it was being shut down.

"I figure it will be safer, I've heard they had some problems with it," Cyr said. "Hopefully they clean up the mess."

Cyr discussed the plant as he fished in the waters of the same river that plays a role in the plant's cooling systems.

"We do fish here," he said. "I don't do much swimming here. And we definitely don't eat the fish."



headline: Maine 'hermit' pleads not guilty to stealing to support himself
byline: By Dave Sherwood
8:31am EDT

A Maine man who lived in the woods with nearly no human contact for 27 years, supporting himself by stealing food and supplies, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to seven counts of burglary and six of theft.

Christopher Knight, 47, was clean-shaven with closely cropped hair and looked well fed at the time of his arrest in April. He has grown a full beard in his four months in prison and now looks gaunt.

Since his capture, he has been the subject of a documentary, countless media stories, received marriage proposals and a "no-strings-attached" offer by a stranger to pay his bail.

Wearing baggy green prison clothes as he sat in a courthouse just 20 miles east of his long-time woodland hideout, Knight appeared unfazed by the bustle of reporters and television cameras.

He answered "not guilty" to each of the counts but otherwise did not address the court.

Justice Michaela Murphy set Knight's trial for October 8. Prosecution and defense attorneys said they were confident they would be able to reach a plea deal that would avoid trial.

"We're trying to come to an agreement that includes both the punishment angle and rehabilitation," said Kennebec County District Attorney Maeghan Maloney, adding that Knight was found competent to stand trial.

Police contend Knight committed as many as 1,000 burglaries in order to survive. The list of stolen items runs the gamut from flashlights, electrical tape and propane to video games and marshmallows.

Authorities initially said Knight confessed to many of the burglaries. His attorney Walter McKee said Knight pleaded "not guilty" because of technicalities involved with the confession.

He noted Knight said he had "always 100 percent completely accepted responsibility for what he did," and called the situation "awkward."

Knight has offered little explanation for why he walked away from his home in 1986 and began a life with almost no human contact. He was arrested in April after police said they caught him stealing food and supplies from a summer camp for the disabled.

At the time he was arrested, authorities said everything but his eyeglasses, the same pair he wore in a photo taken of him shortly before he disappeared, was stolen.

Knight's camp, well-appointed with a tent, sleeping bags and cookstove, was hidden amongst boulders and crevices on a hillside of evergreens just a few hundred yards from the nearest house.

The judge confirmed bail at $25,000, but prohibited third parties from offering it, making it unlikely Knight, who has no possessions, would post it.

"There are those who don't think he should be prosecuted at all. Others think he should be in prison for the rest of his life," said Maloney. "But no one wants him to return to the life he was living before unless he can do so legally."

A small Christian university in central Alabama was locked down for more than an hour on Tuesday, after an employee was shot by her husband on campus, university officials said.

The woman, a contract worker in the university's maintenance department, was taken to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries, Montgomery police said. Her condition was not immediately available, nor was her name or that of her husband.

Her husband was arrested after the lunchtime shooting, sparked by a domestic argument, said Dave Hogan, spokesman for Faulkner University in Montgomery, Alabama. The attack happened in a parking lot near the maintenance building, police said.

No students were involved, Hogan said.

The lockdown lasted just over an hour before campus activity resumed, Hogan said.

Faulkner University is affiliated with the Church of Christ. More than 3,500 students are enrolled in its four campuses across Alabama. Montgomery is the main campus.



headline: Couples challenge Nebraska ban on gay adoptive and foster parents
byline: By Brendan O'Brien
8:31am EDT

Gay and lesbian couples in Nebraska should be allowed to serve as foster or adoptive parents to children who are in state custody, according to a state court lawsuit filed on Tuesday.

A lesbian couple and two gay couples filed the lawsuit in a Lincoln district court arguing the state policy created in 1995 banning them from becoming foster or adoptive parents to children under care of Nebraska is unconstitutional.

The lawsuit comes two months after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred same-sex couples from federal marriage benefits.

The ruling has led to a wave of legal challenges in federal and state courts to laws that restrict the rights of gays and lesbians.

Nebraska's policy prohibits the state's department of health and human services from issuing foster-home licenses to or placing children with people who identify themselves as homosexuals or to people who are unrelated, unmarried adults living together.

According to Leslie Cooper, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the couples in Nebraska, the state, through the screening process, has made multiple exceptions for unrelated, unmarried adults who live together, but not for gay and lesbian couples.

"There should be individual screenings subjected to the same standards for everybody that applies," she said.

The lawsuit contends the policy is unconstitutional because it treat gays and lesbians differently than heterosexuals, violates their personal liberties and subjects them to prejudice based on sexual orientation.

Given Nebraska's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, the provision that excludes unrelated, unmarried adults from being adoptive and foster-care parents inherently applies to gay and lesbian couples, Cooper noted.

A lesbian couple in Michigan is challenging that state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and the state law that prevents them from jointly adopting each other's children.

State courts in Nebraska as well as Kentucky, North Carolina and Ohio have ruled that so-called second-parent adoptions are not available under current law. Second-parent adoption is the adoption of a child by a second parent in the home who is not married to the child's legal parent.

Nebraska is joined by Utah and Mississippi as states having the most restrictive adoption and foster-care policies, according to Cooper.

Utah, where gay marriage is not allowed, bans all unmarried individuals in cohabiting relationships from being adoptive or foster-care parents, while Mississippi only bans same-gender couples from those roles, she said.



headline: Eight months after massacre, Newtown begins new school year
byline: By Edith Honan
8:31am EDT

The Connecticut town that was the site of a shooting rampage that left 20 elementary school students and six faculty and staff dead last December, appeared largely the same on Tuesday as it did a year ago.

But as students from Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School began their first full academic year at their temporary quarters in the former Chalk Hill school in nearby Monroe, residents said they feel that life had changed.

"It's like after 9/11. The world looks different. It is different," said Kris Mauro, 46, a Newtown resident. "Everybody looks the same, everybody's just as nice. But it's a different world."

Mauro said her chief frustration is that she had hoped "we'd get rid of all the guns," but that gun-rights groups have instead been emboldened since the shooting.

Last December 14, Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old who had grown up in Newtown, shot and killed his mother before shooting his way into the Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he killed 26 people before turning a gun on himself. The sheer youth of Lanza's victims, mostly 6- and 7-year-olds, stunned the country.

The massacre inspired a package of national gun control measures in Congress as well as calls for better security in schools, including the presence of armed guards.

The bills, which included a national ban on assault weapons and expanding the use of background checks for gun purchases, were ultimately rejected after U.S. lawmakers decided they would have interfered with Americans' constitutional right to bear arms.

Several U.S. states - including Connecticut, New York and New Jersey -have passed laws tightening gun ownership requirements since the attack. Other states have expanded gun rights.

But in Newtown on Tuesday, the gun debate was secondary to hopes that kids here could have a normal school year.

"You don't forget, but you have to go forward," said Rose Scotti, 60, as she loaded groceries at a local store.

Around Newtown, a leafy and bucolic town, most of the informal memorials that once dotted the landscape here have been dismantled.

Near the Sandy Hook fire station, where anguished parents awaited news of their kids on the day of the shooting, a neighbor still hangs a sign that reads "God Bless the Families." It is accompanied by a large heart that frames 20 wooden crosses.

Some shop windows still display the green and white cards that were all over town after the shooting: "We are Sandy Hook. We choose love."

But at a local coffee shop, no one appeared to be talking about the shooting unless asked about it.

The site of the shooting is scheduled to be torn down and replaced by a new structure that still awaits formal approval. It is due to open in time for the 2016 school year and is expected to be enclosed in a high fence and be watched over by armed guards.

headline: New York officer charged with lying about photographer's arrest
byline: By Chris Francescani
8:31am EDT

A New York police officer has been indicted on three felony counts of falsifying records to justify his arrest last year of a New York Times photographer, the Bronx district attorney said.

A Bronx grand jury indicted NYPD officer Michael Ackermann on Monday in a case stemming from his arrest in August 2012 of photographer Robert Stolarik, whom Ackermann said had interfered with the arrest of a teenage girl.

Ackermann, 30, said in a police report at the time that Stolarik had repeatedly set off the flash on his camera in his face - blinding and distracting him - during the arrest.

But Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said in a statement that an investigation determined that Stolarik's camera did not have a flash attached at the time of the arrest, which took place at 10:30 p.m. on August 4, 2012.

Ackerman was indicted on three felony counts and five misdemeanor counts of falsifying records and making false statements.

He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of the most serious felony, tampering with public records. Ackermann was released without bail on Monday following an arraignment in state court in the Bronx.

He has been suspended without pay pending the outcome of his criminal case, NYPD Deputy Commissioner John McCarthy said .

Ackermann's attorney, Michael Martinez, did not immediately return a call for comment.

All charges against Stolarik, a longtime freelance New York Times photographer, have been dismissed, Johnson's office said.

Stolarik was photographing the arrest of a teenage girl following a street fight when a police officer told him to stop taking pictures, according to an account of the incident published last year in the New York Times.

Stolarik said he identified himself as a Times photographer and continued to shoot pictures.

A second officer grabbed his camera and "slammed" it into his face, he told the newspaper. He said police took his cameras and roughed him up before arresting him on charges of obstructing government administration and resisting arrest.

Following the arrest, police officials said Stolarik and others had been repeatedly ordered to move back, but that Stolarik pressed forward and inadvertently struck an officer in the face with his camera. They said Stolarik "violently" resisted arrest, according to the New York Times.

Stolarik did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A New York Times spokeswoman, Abbe Serphos, said in a statement, "We are pleased that officials in the Bronx took a serious look at this case and brought an indictment after finding police misconduct."

headline: Missing U.S. teenager, fascinated with wilderness movie, found dead
byline: By Karen Brooks
8:31am EDT

The body of an Arizona teenager whose disappearance into the woods a week ago may have been inspired by a movie about a young man who died after venturing into the Alaskan wilderness has been found in Oregon.

The death of 18-year-old Johnathan Croom, whose body was found on Monday evening in a wooded area in Oregon about 1,000 feet from his 2000 Honda CRV, is being investigated as a suicide, a statement from Douglas County Sheriff's Office said.

No other information was released in the statement from the office late on Monday.

Croom's car was found abandoned last week near the small town of Riddle, Oregon, in the southwestern part of the state. His identification and money were found inside the car.

Croom had failed to return on August 22 to resume classes at Mesa Community College in Arizona after driving to visit a friend in Washington state.

Croom's father David said son had sent a text message to a friend more than a week ago saying: "I'm going adventuring."

Speaking to Reuters on Sunday, David Croom described his son as a happy young man with an electric smile who in the past six months had grown fascinated by the true story of Christopher McCandless portrayed in the 2007 movie "Into the Wild."

In the early 1990s, McCandless, a recent college graduate, embarked on a cross-continental journey, discarding his possessions and living in the rugged Alaskan wilderness, where he eventually died of starvation.

McCandless' story was first made famous by a best-selling non-fiction book, "Into the Wild," by adventure writer Jon Krakauer, published in 1996, and then the movie.

The Douglas County Sheriff's Office found Croom's car on Wednesday.

David Croom said residents had told him they had noticed the abandoned vehicle as early as the weekend before that. He said he had been told by a logger that he had seen a young man with "the most amazing grin" walking with a woman two days earlier. Croom said he did not know who the woman might have been.

Croom said his son had split up with his girlfriend a few weeks ago and that may have been weighing on his mind.

Volunteers joined the search for the missing teenager, including one group that offered to send in drones and horses.

Aside from a stint with the Boy Scouts of America, David Croom said his son had little outdoors experience.

"He doesn't really have the skill set for this," he said.

Croom said he had not been aware of his son's fascination with McCandless' journey until after he went missing.

"The problem I have with that movie is that several kids have tried to emulate it, and what he was doing was dangerous," he said. "The guy in the movie doesn't make it."

headline: Preliminary hearing starts in U.S. Naval Academy rape case
byline: By Lacey Johnson
8:31am EDT

A preliminary hearing for three former U.S. Naval Academy football players charged with raping a drunken female midshipman got under way on Tuesday, the latest in a string of sexual assault allegations in the U.S. military.

The midshipmen - Tra'ves Bush, Eric Graham and Joshua Tate - have been charged with sexually assaulting the woman in April 2012 while she was passed out after drinking too much at an off-campus party.

The so-called Article 32 hearing will determine if a general court-martial is warranted. Navy Commander Robert Monahan, who is presiding over the case at Washington's Navy Yard, is expected to take several days to weigh the evidence.

Academy Superintendent Vice Admiral Michael Miller - after a probe by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service - in June ordered that Bush, Graham and Tate be charged with sexual assault and making false statements.

The investigation was touched off by allegations of an incident at the party in Annapolis, Maryland, site of the elite academy that educates Navy and Marine officers. The woman's attorney, Susan Burke, said in May that her client got drunk and passed out at the party at a "football house."

She woke up with little recollection of what had happened, and later learned that three football players were claiming to have had sexual intercourse with her while she was drunk, Burke said.

Burke said one of the football players pressured the woman not to cooperate with investigators. But when she followed the advice she was "ostracized and retaliated against by the football players and the Naval Academy community."

The woman was also disciplined for drinking. She sought legal help in early 2013 and the Navy reopened the investigation, Burke said.

Reuters generally does not publish the names of sexual assault victims.

The hearing comes after a spate of high-profile military sexual assault cases, including some involving personnel whose job it was to prevent sexual abuse.

An annual Pentagon study this year estimated that unwanted sexual contact in the military, from groping to rape, jumped by 37 percent in 2012 to 26,000 cases.

President Barack Obama told Marines at Camp Pendleton, California, this month that sexual assault undermined the U.S. military. He also spoke at the Naval Academy's graduation ceremony in May and urged the new officers to stamp out sexual assault in their ranks.

The increased number of sex-related incidents in the military prompted members of Congress to introduce legislation to toughen the Pentagon's handling of sex crimes.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and military service chiefs have opposed taking sexual assault prosecution decisions out of the chain of command.



headline: SEC says Indiana man used Ponzi scheme to fund a reality TV show
byline: By Jonathan Stempel
8:31am EDT

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged an Indiana man with running a $6 million Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors out of their retirement savings and used the money to invest in a bridal store, a bounty hunter reality television show, and a soul food restaurant owned by the bounty hunters.

The SEC on Monday said it obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of defendants John Marcum and his firm Guaranty Reserves Trust LLC.

Marcum, 49, of Noblesville, Indiana, was accused of deceiving at least 37 people into investing in promissory notes issued by his firm by promising double-digit annual returns with no risk to principal by day-trading in stocks.

"Marcum tricked investors into putting their retirement nest eggs in his hands by portraying himself as a talented trader who could earn high returns while eliminating the risk of loss," said Timothy Warren, acting director of the SEC's Chicago regional office.

The SEC said Marcum regularly gave clients account statements showing annualized returns of more than 20 percent with no monthly losses.

Instead, the regulator said he lost more than $900,000 on what little trading he conducted, and used the remaining funds to invest in start-up ventures and finance a lifestyle including Mercedes-Benz car payments, airline tickets, nightclub outlays, and charges to his former wife's credit card.

The SEC said none of the start-ups appears profitable, and that Marcum "is nearly broke, and his accounts contain less than $2,000." It said the scheme began to unravel in mid-2013 when Marcum became unable to meet some investors' redemption demands.

According to the regulator, Marcum admitted misappropriating investor money during a June 18 conference call with three investors, which was recorded.

It said he also told investors during the call that his insurance policies had a two-year waiting period for a "suicide clause" to take effect, and that if he failed to return their money he would kill himself so they could be made whole.

A lawyer for Marcum did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Marcum could not immediately be located.

The lawsuit seeks a fine, the recovery of ill-gotten gains, and a permanent ban on further wrongdoing.

The case is SEC v. Marcum et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Indiana, No. 13-01361.



headline: Another San Diego worker files claim, saying mayor harassed her
byline: By Dan Whitcomb
8:31am EDT

A San Diego parks employee who says Mayor Bob Filner put her in a headlock and rubbed against her breasts at a public event this year filed a $500,000 battery and sexual harassment claim against the city on Monday, her attorney said.

Stacy McKenzie, one of 18 women who accuse Filner of making unwanted sexual advances, is the second in two months to initiate legal action against the embattled politician. Her claim is the precursor to a lawsuit.

Filner, a former Democratic congressman who was elected mayor of California's second-largest city last year, announced on Friday that he would step down effective August 30 as part of a settlement with the city over a lawsuit filed by his former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson.

The city had filed its own suit against Filner, 70, seeking to recover any damages it might incur in Jackson's case. The City Council also voted to deny a request from the mayor's private lawyers to pick up any of his attorney fees.

McKenzie, a parks department district manager who has worked for the city for 32 years, alleged that the mayor touched her inappropriately during a public event in April.

"Filner, who was attending the event as a dignitary, sexually battered Ms. McKenzie after asking her on a date when he pursued her across a city park where families were gathered, grabbed her from behind and put her into a headlock with his right arm rubbing across her breasts and his left arm rubbing her upper arm," her attorney, Dan Gilleon, said in a statement.

In her written claim, McKenzie accuses the city of failing to prevent sexual harassment by Filner or to warn of his "predatory nature." The claim seeks $500,000 in compensatory and punitive damages.

"Although the city attorney previously stated he 'will not under any circumstance represent Bob Filner,' he has now switched corners and is defending the mayor," Gilleon said.

'WRONG MESSAGE'

"We believe downplaying Filner's conduct is not only legally wrong, it also sends the wrong message for a high profile, elected official to minimize the very type of sexual battery he has previously condemned," Gilleon said.

"At the same time, our client does not want her case to cost the city millions of dollars. We hope the city attorney will put aside both hats he has been wearing and negotiate a fair and balanced settlement," he added.

Neither a law firm representing Filner nor his press secretary could be reached on Monday afternoon for comment about the claim. A spokesman for San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith did not immediately return calls seeking comment.

In announcing his resignation on Friday, an emotional Filner apologized to San Diego residents but said no sexual harassment allegations had been proven against him.

"In a lynch mob mentality, rumors become allegations, allegations become facts, facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall," he said.

Since Jackson filed her suit last month, 17 more women have come forward to accuse Filner of groping, forced kisses or making other unwanted advances.

Among them were a retired U.S. Navy admiral, a college dean, a licensed vocational nurse, several business women and two military veterans who said he harassed them at a meeting for women who had been raped while serving in the armed forces.

Nearly every elected official in San Diego from both parties urged him to step down, including all nine members of City Council. The mayor has apologized for what he acknowledged was a pattern of disrespectful and intimidating behavior toward women.

election on Monday, railing against President Barack Obama's healthcare reform and touting her support of jobs and businesses.

Flanked by three Republican governors and standing before a crowd of about 60 supporters and protesters at a rally in Greenville, Haley pushed her business credentials and said she had brought thousands of jobs to the state.

"I promised I'd bring jobs to South Carolina," Haley said, speaking on the same day her campaign released a web video featuring endorsements by members of her state's business community. "As of today, 37,500 jobs in 45 of 46 counties. That's what we did in South Carolina."

Haley was swept into office on a tide of Tea Party support in 2010 when she was a junior state legislator. The daughter of immigrants from India, she was the first woman elected governor of South Carolina.

She also used the appearance on Monday to slam the Affordable Care Act, saying she was proud of the state for not expanding Medicaid "just because President Obama said we needed to."

States have come under fire for not expanding Medicaid by advocates who say it will leave the poor with no coverage, but conservatives argue that Medicaid is broken.

Some protesters booed her speech, but Haley responded by thanking them for being there, saying that her husband, Michael, was fighting in Afghanistan to give them that right.

Haley was joined on Monday by fellow Republican governors Rick Perry of Texas, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who used the occasion to take a swipe at Haley's Democratic opponent, who lost to her in 2010.

Jindal said Democrats like her opponent, state Senator Vincent Sheheen, "measure success in government by how many people are dependent on government."

Republicans, he said, measure success by how many people are not dependent on government, "not because we kicked them out, not because we pushed them to the curb."

Haley raised $619,000 in the latest campaign contributions filing period and had almost $2.5 million cash on hand as of July 10. Sheheen had raised about $611,000 in the same time period and had about $571,000 cash on hand.

A statewide poll conducted in April showed Haley's job approval rating at 43.5 percent.

Haley's administration was criticized last year after the nation's largest security breach of data from a state agency. Hackers stole millions of taxpayers' Social Security numbers, tax records and credit card numbers from state Department of Revenue computers that were, in some cases, 30 years old.

Haley also paid ethics fines for misreporting campaign contributions.



headline: Yosemite blaze rages closer to reservoir for San Francisco
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

One of the largest California wildfires in decades roared largely unchecked for a 10th day through forests in and around Yosemite National Park on Monday and threatened a reservoir that supplies most of San Francisco's water.

As of midday, the eastern flank of the so-called Rim Fire had burned to within a mile of Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy reservoir on the Tuolumne River, raising concerns about the possibility of ash and soot contaminating the sprawling artificial lake.

On Saturday, flames had been no closer than 4 miles from the reservoir, which supplies 85 percent of the water consumed by 2.6 million people in San Francisco and several communities in three adjacent counties about 200 miles to the west.

Roughly 300 million gallons of water is carried to the San Francisco Bay area daily through tunnels and an aqueduct, and reservoir samples show water quality has remained healthy since the fire began on August 17, according to a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.

"There's no evidence of a change in the water quality, and there's no change in our ability to deliver that water to all of our customers," said the spokeswoman, Suzanne Gautier.

If fallout from the blaze were to foul the Hetch Hetchy, its water could be diverted to a smaller Bay Area reservoir for filtration at a local treatment plant before delivery to customers, she said.

The Rim Fire, named for a Stanislaus National Forest lookout point called Rim of the World, has already damaged two of the three hydropower generating stations linked to the Hetch Hetchy reservoir that supply electricity for all of San Francisco's public facilities, such as hospitals and firehouses.

Gautier said the city for now was continuing to draw on reserve power stored for emergencies and purchasing additional electricity on the open market to make up for the difference.

Despite threats to water and power, firefighters have made headway against the blaze, although rugged terrain and the fire's remote location were complicating efforts to subdue the flames, fire managers said.

"There are places where they can't get in," said Mike Ferris, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. "It's just inaccessible."

As of Monday morning, fire crews working with hand tools and backed by bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters had carved containment lines around 15 percent of the blaze's perimeter, more than double Sunday's figure, though the fire's footprint continued to grow.

OVER 200 SQUARE MILES SCORCHED

The blaze in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains was among the fastest-moving of some 50 large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West. The fires have strained resources and prompted fire managers to open talks with Pentagon commanders and Canadian officials about possible reinforcements.

According to the latest estimates, the Rim Fire has charred nearly 150,000 acres or 234 square miles - the size of the city of Chicago - most of that in the Stanislaus National Forest west of Yosemite.

That ranks the blaze as the largest wildfire in California since August 2009, when the so-called Station Fire ravaged nearly 145,000 acres of the Angeles National Park north of Los Angeles, and one of the 20 biggest in state history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

By Monday morning, nearly 22,000 acres within Yosemite had burned, forcing the closure of the main road leading into the park from the San Francisco Bay area and prompting the evacuation of 74 campsites in the park's White Wolf area, officials said. (<a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>)

But the majority of the 1,200-square-mile Yosemite National Park, including the Yosemite Valley area famous for its towering rock formations, waterfalls, meadows and pine forests, remained open to the public.

The fire was not believed to pose a threat to the concrete structure of the 90-year-old O'Shaughnessy Dam, which forms the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, or of the granite basin it was built into, Gautier said.

But in addition to the immediate potential fallout of ash and soot, Hetch Hetchy's water could be left vulnerable to heavy runoff of debris and topsoil stripped of vegetation by the blaze and washed into the reservoir by winter rains, she said.

"When you burn down everything, you've got a moonscape out there when floods can contaminate the water," Governor Jerry Brown said during a visit to the fire zone on Monday. He declared a state of emergency for San Francisco on Friday due to threats to the city's water supply.

The blaze has destroyed about a dozen homes and 1,000 outbuildings, and some 4,500 additional dwellings remained threatened. Residents in the tiny town of Tuolumne and other communities near the western edge of the park were evacuated, but evacuation orders have been lifted for the enclaves of Pine Mountain Lake and Buck Meadows.

The cause of the wildfire remained under investigation. More than 3,700 firefighters have been assigned to the blaze, which was burning over steep terrain through scrub, oak and pine, stoked by stiff winds, high temperatures and low humidity.

terrorism cases against American citizens.

The August report revealed that a secretive DEA unit passes the NSA information to agents in the field, including those from the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI and Homeland Security, with instructions to never disclose the original source, even in court. In most cases, the NSA tips involve drugs, money laundering and organized crime, not terrorism.

Five Democrats in the Senate and three senior Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee submitted questions to Holder about the NSA-DEA relationship, joining two prominent Republicans who have expressed concerns. The matter will be discussed during classified briefings scheduled for September, Republican and Democratic aides said.

"These allegations raise serious concerns that gaps in the policy and law are allowing overreach by the federal government's intelligence gathering apparatus," wrote the senators - Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Tom Udall of New Mexico, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sherrod Brown of Ohio.

Holder, an appointee of U.S. President Barack Obama, is the country's top lawman as head of the Justice Department. The Justice Department is reviewing the congressional inquiry, a spokesman for Holder said on Monday.

The Reuters reports cited internal documents that show how DEA's Special Operations Division funnels information from overseas NSA intercepts, domestic wiretaps, informants and a large DEA database of telephone records to authorities nationwide to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.

The documents show that agents have been trained to conceal how such investigations truly begin - to "recreate" the investigative trail to effectively cover up the original source of the information, raising questions about whether exculpatory information might be withheld from defendants at trial.

'PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION'

The internal documents describe the process of recreating the evidence trail to omit any reference to the Special Operations Division as "parallel construction." For example, agents said in interviews, they act as if a drug investigation began with a traffic stop for speeding or a broken taillight, instead of a tip passed from the NSA. An IRS document describes a similar process for tax agency investigators.

Justice Department officials have said they are reviewing the matter. DEA officials have said the practice is legal and has been in near-daily use since the 1990s. The purpose is to protect sources and methods, not to withhold evidence, they said.

wrote to Holder on August 9, shortly after the original Reuters report.

"If this report is accurate, then it describes an unacceptable breakdown in the barrier between foreign intelligence surveillance and criminal process," the congressmen wrote.

On the CBS program Face the Nation on August 18, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, a Republican, said the use of NSA intelligence to make non-terrorism cases should be scrutinized. "I think we need to have a very careful examination of this. I think that the trust of the American people in their government is what's at stake here," he said.

headline: Following NY lawsuit, online lender to cease funding loans
byline: By Nate Raymond
8:31am EDT

An online lender accused by the New York attorney general of "scamming" consumers with high interest rates says it will cease funding loans next week.

Western Sky Financial LLC, which says it is owned by a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, posted a notice on its website saying it would cease funding loans on September 3.

No reasons were given. The notice came two weeks after Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued the company in a state court in Manhattan for charging interest rates as high as 355 percent for consumers who took out personal loans.

The interest rates exceeded the maximum 16 percent most lenders are allowed to charge under New York law, the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit, which also named CashCall Inc and its affiliate WS Funding LLC among other parties, said since 2010, Western Sky lent more than $38 million to New Yorkers via 17,970 loans.

Western Sky had already stopped lending to New York residents in March, amid the investigation. A spokeswoman for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company had faced several other recent regulatory challenges by state officials.

The Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services on August 1 sent out a notice of intention to issue a cease and desist order against Western Sky.

The Michigan action came days after Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens sued Western Sky for making illegal payday loans.

In addition to Schneiderman's lawsuit, the New York State Department of Financial Services had also this month demanded Western Sky and 34 other companies stop offering online payday loans to New Yorkers.

Western Sky had claimed immunity from state and federal law because of its ties to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. A lawyer for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

The case is People of the State of New York v. Western Sky Financial, et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451370/2013.



headline: New Mexico's largest county to allow gay marriage after court ruling
byline: By Zelie Pollon
8:31am EDT

sex marriages are now legal in New Mexico's most populous county and the city of Albuquerque, a court ruled on Monday, adding to recent victories for gays and lesbians seeking the right to wed statewide.

Last week, a judge in Santa Fe County ordered the county clerk there to issue same-sex marriage licenses and a clerk in the southern part of the state decided to hand out such licenses independently of any court ruling.

The ruling could set precedent for expanding the right of gays and lesbians to eventually marry statewide in New Mexico, said representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union.

Denying gays and lesbians the right to marry violates the state constitution, which prohibits gender-based discrimination, wrote Bernalillo County Judge Alan Malott in a decision on Monday clearing the way for same-sex marriage in that county.

"Gay and lesbian citizens of New Mexico have endured a long history of discrimination," Malott ruled. "Denial of the right to marry continues this unfortunate, intolerable pattern and establishes irreparable injury on plaintiffs' part."

The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Center for Lesbian Rights on behalf of same-sex couples seeking the right to marry. It is one of several cases filed recently in New Mexico on the question of gay marriage.

The case included plaintiffs from Santa Fe County and the judge also ruled that gay marriage licenses should be issued there. But a ruling last week by a different judge had already cleared the way for same-sex marriage in Santa Fe County.

Under Malott's ruling, Bernalillo County, with 673,000 residents, will also be required to immediately issue same-sex marriage licenses.

That will mean that three counties in New Mexico will hand out the licenses, including Do単a Ana County in southern New Mexico where the county clerk last week said he would start doing so.

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage.

"Our state is now on the brink of joining the growing list of states who live and honor the values of family, liberty and love," Peter Simonson, ACLU of New Mexico executive director, said in a statement.

The group was not sure how the ruling would affect the state's other 30 counties which are not issuing same-sex marriage licenses, said Micah McCoy, spokesman for the ACLU of New Mexico.

"It's a pretty unconventional route for this kind of case to take, but it will be very useful in arguing the case in other counties where people want to get married," McCoy said.

The New Mexico Supreme Court has declined to rule on lawsuits seeking the right for gays and lesbians to marry, but asked lower courts to handle them first.

Republican lawmakers in the state said they were contemplating ways to fight the decisions by the district court judges in Bernalillo and Santa Fe counties as well as the Dona Ana County Clerk's move to issue same-sex marriage licenses.

"It is inexplicable how a district court just today discovered a new definition of marriage in our laws, when our marriage law has not been changed in over a century," State Senator Bill Sharer, a Republican, said in a statement.

headline: U.S. Army sergeant receives Medal of Honor at White House ceremony
byline: By Ian Simpson
8:31am EDT

President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor on Monday to Army Staff Sergeant Ty Carter, who risked his life to save a wounded soldier under enemy fire during a battle in Afghanistan.

As Carter's family and members of his unit looked on, Obama placed the medal around the soldier's neck at a White House ceremony. It is the highest U.S. military honor.

Carter, 33, is the fifth living service member to receive the Medal of Honor for gallantry in Afghanistan or Iraq.

Carter, who also has been awarded the Purple Heart, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and is an advocate of treatment for others with the ailment, Obama said.

The president took the opportunity to raise the issue of PTSD in the military and urged soldiers not to be ashamed of it.

"It is absolutely critical for us to work with brave young men like Ty to put an end to any stigma that keeps more folks from seeking help," Obama said with Carter at his side.

Carter was the second U.S. soldier to receive the award for bravery for actions on October 3, 2009, when more than 300 Taliban insurgents tried to overrun 53 soldiers at Combat Outpost Keating in Afghanistan's isolated Nuristan province.

The outpost came under "a blizzard of bullets and steel, into which Ty ran not once, or twice, or even a few times, but perhaps 10 times," Obama said.

"In doing so, he displayed the essence of true heroism - not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but to serve others at whatever cost."

Carter, a cavalry scout with the 4th Infantry Division, resupplied ammunition to fighting positions. He fired on advancing Taliban from a Humvee, killing attackers and helping to turn back the assault.

He left the vehicle to rescue a badly wounded comrade, applying a tourniquet and first aid under fire before carrying him back to the Humvee and then to an aid station. That soldier later died of his injuries.

EXPOSED TO GUNFIRE

Carter again exposed himself to gunfire to cut down a burning tree that was threatening the aid station, Obama said.

Eight U.S. soldiers were killed and more than 25 were wounded in the battle at Keating outpost. Obama introduced relatives of those who died at the base, drawing a standing ovation from onlookers, and many family members wiped away tears.

After the ceremony, Carter said he was eager to represent those who had suffered as a result of the war.

"Only those closest to me can see the scars that come from seeing good men take their last breath," he told reporters.

Carter said during the battle he had lost some hearing in his left ear, but he said he would hear the cries of his wounded comrade forever.

Thanks to support from his superiors, friends and his family, Carter said: "I will heal."

"I promise the mothers, the fathers, and spouses of my fallen brothers that I will strive to live up to the responsibility this medal carries," he said.

"I give these men and their families all my respect, my humility and honor."

The battle was the first since the Vietnam War in which two living service members earned the Medal of Honor. Staff Sergeant Clinton Romesha received his medal in February.

Carter, who grew up in Spokane, Washington, enlisted in January 2008 and completed a second Afghanistan deployment in October. He is assigned to the 7th Infantry Division, serving at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state. Carter is married with three children.

The last battle for which two living service members received the Medal of Honor was the 1967 Battle of Ap Bac in Vietnam, a spokeswoman for the Congressional Medal of Honor Society said.



headline: New test aims to benchmark skills of U.S. college graduates
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

Seniors returning to classes at dozens of U.S. colleges and universities have one more hurdle to prepare for this school year: a new standardized test for graduating students intended to give prospective employers a measure of their abilities.

Called Collegiate Learning Assessment Plus (CLA+), the test aims to provide a more objective way to compare the intellectual achievements of graduates of different schools.

"It's another set of information that employers can use to review the applicant," said Robert Keeley, director of assessment services at the Council for Aid to Education, the New York-based nonprofit that has developed the test. "We're looking to equip students to share their scores more readily than they have in the past."

About 200 colleges and universities, including small liberal arts colleges Ursuline College of Pepper Pike, Ohio, and Stonehill College of Easton, Massachusetts as well as some of the California and Texas state university systems, have signed up to give the CLA+ tests at the end of the academic year now getting underway.

The test will measure analysis, problem solving, writing, quantitative reasoning and reading, the Council for Aid to Education said.

It could serve a similar role to the admission exams that graduate schools rely on as a standard evaluation for their applicants.

Students will be able to incorporate the results of the CLA+ test into their resumes and have the option of sending copies of the reports to potential employers, Keeley said.

The tests could help address the problem of grade inflation, with schools awarding higher grades over the years in an effort to attract and retain students, said Michael Poliakoff, vice president of policy at the nonprofit American Council of Trustees and Alumni.

"Employers want to see something they can rely on," Poliakoff said. "They don't want to see a portfolio of things that show a candidate may or may not have done."

Poliakoff, who participated in a focus group on the test's development, said the test could help graduates demonstrate "just how valid those grades on a transcript are."

The test is being phased in at a time when U.S. officials are wrestling with the rising cost of a college education. President Barack Obama last week proposed a plan to tackle soaring U.S. education costs with a new system that judges colleges and universities on their financial value and ties those ratings to disbursement of federal aid.

The plan calls on the U.S. Department of Education to institute a ratings system before the 2015 school year that would allow students and parents to select schools based on the best value for the money.

Douglas Bennett, a Council for Aid to Education board member and emeritus professor of politics at Earlham College in Indiana, said the test showed promise.

"A dirty secret about higher education for a very long while is, we've had no particularly good ways of knowing the most important thing, and that is whether students are learning," he said. "Partly that's been because we didn't have the right, clever ideas to figure out how to do that."



headline: State of Georgia high court to hear appeal on lethal injections
byline: By David Beasley
8:31am EDT

Georgia's Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear an appeal in the case of a death row inmate who challenged a new law shielding the identity and methods of companies that make the state's lethal injection drugs.

The decision could delay the execution of Warren Lee Hill by months, the court said.

Hill, 53, was sentenced to die for fatally beating another inmate in 1990 while serving a life sentence for killing his girlfriend. His lawyers claim he is mentally disabled and should not be executed.

Hill's execution was scheduled for July 19 but delayed by Fulton County Judge Gail Tusan after Hill challenged the constitutionality of Georgia's new law concealing the source of lethal injection drugs from the public, attorneys and judges in court proceedings.

The law was passed in March by legislators concerned about the dwindling supplies of pentobarbital, the injection drug, amid pressure by anti-death penalty activists on companies that provide lethal injection drugs to the state, attorneys said.

Attorneys for the state said the law was designed to protect the companies from harassment and lawsuits. But Hill's lawyers argued the law made it impossible to determine whether a drug has been tainted with other substances that could cause excessive pain to the prisoner.

The state of Georgia appealed Tusan's ruling to the state Supreme Court.

In agreeing to hear the case, the court on Monday asked attorneys to address four questions, including whether providing a sample of the execution drug to Hill's attorneys for testing prior to the execution would be a way to the resolve the case.

Oral arguments will likely be held in the next several months, the court said. Meanwhile, a stay of execution for Hill remained in place.

Lauren Kane, spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, declined to comment on Monday's decision. Brian Kammer, Hill's attorney, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.

In addition to challenging the constitutionality of the new state law, Hill's lawyers have also filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing he should not be executed because he is mentally disabled.



headline: Two charged with stealing source code from NY trading firm

frequency trading firm in an effort to start their own business.

Jason Vuu, 26, a former trader at Flow Traders LLC in Manhattan, was charged with emailing himself trading strategies, valuation algorithms and proprietary code from the firm and sharing the code with another man, Simon Lu, 25, according to criminal complaints filed by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance.

Another former trader at Flow Traders, Glen Cressman, 26, was charged with copying files containing trading strategies and valuation algorithms without permission, the complaints said.

Paul Shechtman, a lawyer for Lu, and Jeremy Saland, a lawyer for Vuu, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.

Charles Ross, who represents Cressman, said his client was innocent.

"He was a fine employee, and when everything about the case is aired, it will be clear he did nothing wrong," Ross said.

A lawyer for Flow Traders, which according to its website is an international proprietary trading house headquartered in Amsterdam, could not be reached immediately for comment.

The three men were arraigned on the charges two weeks ago and are due back in court on November 18, when they could face grand jury indictments. Lu currently resides in Pittsburgh, Vuu in California, and Cressman in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, according to prosecutors.

The arrests came a year after Vance's office charged former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (<span id="symbol_GS.N_0">GS.N</span>) programmer Sergey Aleynikov with stealing secret trading code. Aleynikov had been previously been convicted in federal court for the same actions, but his conviction was thrown out in February 2012 by an appeals court, which said federal espionage laws did not cover his alleged theft.

Vance then charged Aleynikov under New York state law. Earlier this year, a judge denied Aleynikov's attempt to have the state charges dismissed on double jeopardy grounds. Aleynikov, who pleaded not guilty, is free on bail.

Both Vance and the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, Preet Bharara, whose office brought the initial case against Aleynikov, have made combating computer crime and corporate espionage a top priority.

Lu, Vuu and Cressman all face multiple counts of unlawful duplication of computer-related material and unauthorized use of secret scientific material, the same charges Aleynikov is facing. The charges carry sentences of up to four years in prison.

Vuu sent copies of files from his work email account to his personal email address 10 times from August 2011 to August 2012, the complaint said. He also shared source code with Lu via the file-hosting service Dropbox after Lu suggested the code could help them start their own firm, according to the complaint.

Cressman's personal email account received copied files containing trading strategies and valuation algorithms twice in December 2012, according to the complaint.

The charges were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

headline: Hundreds of dogs rescued in multi-state dog fighting case

8:31am EDT

Some 367 pit bulls, many scarred and emaciated, have been rescued and a dozen people across the southeastern United States have been charged with dog fighting in what animal advocacy groups called one of the largest such raids in U.S. history.

"The number of dogs seized and the amount of money involved in this case shows how extensive this underworld of dog fighting is," U.S. Attorney for the Middle District Alabama George Beck said in a statement on Monday. "These dog fighters abuse, starve and kill their dogs for the supposed 'fun' of watching and gambling on a dog fight."

The suspects, who come from Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and Texas, face multiple charges related to dog fighting and gambling, with each charge carrying up to five years in prison. Dog fighting is a felony in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

At one site, some 114 emaciated, wounded dogs were found chained to tires, without food and water, and in makeshift shelters in scorching summer heat, rescue groups said.

"Thousands of others all over the country continue to endure unimaginable suffering and death just like this at the hands of dog fighters," said Tim Rickey of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which along with the Humane Society of the United States helped remove the dogs.

"We want to end it once and for all."

The U.S. Attorney said in a statement that the charges are the result of a three-year investigation by nearly two dozen state, local and federal agencies. They seized more than $500,000, drugs, guns and other evidence in what they called a high-stakes ring that saw bets up to $200,000 per fight, according to the statement.

This size of this raid is second only in the United States to a 2009 case in which more than 500 dogs were rescued and more than 100 people in eight states were arrested, according to the ASPCA.

headline: Fort Hood shooting victim struggling to cope with injuries
byline: By Ellen Wulfhorst
8:31am EDT

A U.S. Army staff sergeant partly paralyzed and brain damaged from the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, on Monday said his injuries left him deeply angry and worried about finding work, remaining married and caring for his infant son.

Staff Sergeant Patrick Ziegler was one of a dozen witnesses to tell of their losses in the sentencing phase for Major Nidal Hasan, who was convicted on Friday of killing 13 people and wounding 31 others in the November 5, 2009 attack on unarmed fellow service members. Family members of those slain talked of being suicidal and of seemingly insurmountable grief.

Hasan could face execution. The military jury of 13 officers who convicted him are now considering his punishment.

Some witnesses lost their composure as they testified about the toll of the slaughter on their lives. Young widow Cristi Greene broke down into sobs that obscured much of what she tried to say about her slain husband, Specialist Frederick Greene, age 29.

Jennifer Hunt, the widow of Specialist Jason Hunt, 22, said she twice had attempted suicide since his death.

"I pretty much lost my mind for a while," she testified.

Juan Velez recalled the day he learned his pregnant daughter Private Francheska Velez, 21, died at the hands of Hasan.

"It hurt me down to the bottom of my soul," Velez said. "He killed my grandson and he killed me, slowly."

Ziegler, who limped heavily to the witness stand, testified that he was shot four times, including once in the head. He underwent emergency surgery that removed 20 percent of his brain, he said.

"I was expected to either die or remain in a vegetative state for the rest of my life," he testified. He was 27 at the time of the shooting.

His injuries rendered him partly paralyzed, unable to use his left hand and with vision troubles, he said. A college graduate, Ziegler said he now has the cognitive abilities of a 10th- or 11th-grader and fears he will be unable to hold a regular job when he is discharged from the military next month.

"Eventually I will succumb to my wounds," he said. "I won't be able to function."

The shooting left him severely depressed and angry, he said.

"It pretty much affected every facet of my personality. I'm a lot angrier and a lot darker than I used to be," he testified.

He said his wife "kind of has to lead me around," and in caring for his 10-month-old son, he said: "I'm unable to interact and play with him like a normal father would."

Hasan did not cross-examine any of the witnesses during Monday's hearing. During the trial, Hasan did not call any witnesses on his behalf.

DEATH PENALTY POSSIBLE

Hasan, a psychiatrist, was convicted of 45 charges of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder. If the jury is unanimous, he could face the death penalty by lethal injection, possibly making him the first U.S. soldier to be executed by the U.S. military since 1961.

Hasan, 42, an American-born Muslim who acted as his own defense lawyer, told mental health evaluators he wanted to become a martyr and lawyers assisting him said he was actively seeking the death penalty, though Hasan has disputed that claim.

The trial recessed at about 3:30 p.m. CDT and was slated to resume on Tuesday with more witness testimony.

Hasan will continue to represent himself in the penalty phase. The judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, has repeatedly reminded him that military-appointed lawyers can represent him but he has declined.

Hasan was convicted of opening fire on unarmed soldiers weeks before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan. He admitted in his opening statement to being the shooter, saying he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war on Islam.

Twelve of the dead were active-duty soldiers and one retired. Of the 31 wounded, 30 were soldiers and one a police officer. Hasan was also charged for shooting at another police officer and missing.

A death sentence by Hasan's jury would trigger a lengthy process requiring the approval of the Fort Hood commanding general, and the president of the United States, in order for there to be an execution.

If he is sentenced to death, Hasan would become the sixth man on death row at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, a maximum security facility for military prisoners.

Specialist Hunt's mother described seeing the two uniformed military officers arrive at her home. Anticipating what they were going to tell her about her son, she said she quickly telephoned her daughter before they could speak so her daughter too could hear the news.

"I laid the cell phone on the table, and I told them, 'Go ahead,'" Gale Hunt testified. Then, she added, "I could hear my daughter screaming on the phone, but I couldn't answer her."



headline: Father fears 2007 movie inspired missing son to flee into Oregon woods
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

An Arizona teenager who appears to have vanished into the remote woods of Oregon may have been inspired by the 2007 movie "Into the Wild," based on the true story of a young man who ventured into the Alaskan wilderness and died there, his father said on Sunday.

Missing 18-year-old Johnathan Croom's 2000 Honda CRV was found a week ago on a road near the small town of Riddle, Oregon, with his identification and money inside it, his father, David Croom, said in a telephone interview from a search site.

The father said he became concerned that his son may have gone missing after he failed to return last Monday to resume classes at Mesa Community College in Arizona, after driving to visit a friend in Washington state.

Croom said his son sent a text message to a friend more than a week ago saying: "I'm going adventuring."

Croom described his son as a happy young man with an electric smile who had - in the past six months - grown fascinated by the true story of Christopher McCandless.

In the early 1990s, McCandless, a recent college graduate, embarked on a cross-continental journey, discarding his possessions and living in the rugged Alaskan wilderness, where he eventually died of starvation.

McCandless' story was made famous by "Into the Wild," a best-selling non-fiction book by adventure writer Jon Krakauer, published in 1996, that was made into a popular movie.

The Douglas County Sheriff's Office found Croom's car on Wednesday. David Croom, who is in Riddle to help in the search for his son, said residents there told him they'd noticed the abandoned vehicle as early as last weekend.

Dwes Hutson, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, declined to comment on the case.

Croom said he had searched along remote roads for his son after getting a tip from a logger who said he had seen a young man with "the most amazing grin" walking with a woman two days earlier. Croom said he didn't know who the woman might have been.

Private search groups and individuals have volunteered to help look for the missing teenager, including one group that offered to send in drones and horses.

Aside from a stint with the Boy Scouts of America, Croom said his son had little outdoors experience.

"He doesn't really have the skill set for this," he said.

Croom said his son had split up with his girlfriend a few weeks ago and that may have been weighing on his mind.

Croom described his son as 6'1" and weighing 140 pounds. He has brown hair and brown eyes and may be carrying a multicolored backpack.

Croom said he was unaware of his son's fascination with McCandless' journey until after he went missing.

"The problem I have with that movie is that several kids have tried to emulate it, and what he was doing was dangerous," said Croom. "The guy in the movie doesn't make it."

headline: U.S. spy agency edges into the light after Snowden revelations
byline: By Tabassum Zakaria
8:31am EDT

There was a time when the U.S. National Security Agency was so secretive that government officials dared not speak its name in public. NSA, the joke went, stood for "No Such Agency."

That same agency this month held an on-the-record conference call with reporters, issued a lengthy press release to rebut a newspaper story, and posted documents on a newly launched open website - icontherecord.tumblr.com (which stands for intelligence community on the record).

The steps were taken under pressure as President Barack Obama's administration tries to calm a public storm over disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that the surveillance agency and its British counterpart scoop up far more Internet and phone data than previously known.

The NSA's moves out of the shadows were meant to show that it operates lawfully and fixes mistakes when they are detected, but not everyone is convinced that it is a fundamental shift toward more openness at the intelligence agencies.

Some steps toward openness were unprecedented.

The government for the first time released opinions - previously labeled Top Secret - from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which never publicly airs its decisions on the electronic eavesdropping and communications collection by the NSA.

The move came despite resistance from some Justice Department lawyers and some NSA and CIA officials concerned about the amount of unredacted material going public in the three FISA Court opinions released, U.S. sources told Reuters.

In the end, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made the decision on how much material was released from the previously secret court opinions.

"There is no disagreement across the community with regard to whether or not we need to be more transparent and it is just a question of determining how far we can safely go," Shawn Turner, DNI spokesman, said.

Obama and other officials have said the NSA surveillance programs are lawful, have been approved by Congress and the FISA Court, and are aimed at detecting and disrupting terrorist plots.

The FISA court said the NSA may unintentionally have collected as many as 56,000 emails of Americans a year from 2008 to 2011 and may have violated the Constitution before adjustments were made.

Some analysts said intelligence agencies had not necessarily entered a brand new world of public displays of information.

"I wouldn't call it a seismic shift towards a greater transparency. The federal government put these documents out under duress," said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.

"The problem is they just keep releasing materials bit by bit and so the scandal never goes away."

Recent efforts by U.S. intelligence agencies to appear more open follow earlier comments by top-level officials that in hindsight raised questions of veracity.

Clapper was asked at a congressional hearing in March whether the NSA collected any type of data on millions of Americans to which he responded: "No sir."

After the Snowden revelations were published in June, Clapper told NBC his response at the hearing had been given in the "most truthful, or least untruthful, manner."

General Keith Alexander, director of the NSA, told Reuters in May that the agency had no interest in reading the emails of U.S. citizens, and quipped: "The great irony is we're the only ones not spying on the American people."

Government officials are loath to say that Snowden's disclosures prompted greater openness, but analysts say it did have an effect.

"The amount of knowledge that people now have about what NSA does means that we can't simply pretend it doesn't exist. That's where Snowden changed things," said James Lewis, a senior fellow, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

To make the disclosed NSA programs palatable to the public, more openness is required, he said. "There is a link between transparency and accountability and political acceptance."

Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the organization was pleased with the recent release of documents and hoped the government would release more in the coming weeks.

But it should not be viewed as a huge shift toward transparency by the administration, said Jaffer, whose group has also sued the federal government for more information on its use of unmanned drones.

"In fact, on the same day the president promised more transparency on surveillance issues, the CIA filed a brief in one of our 'targeted killing' cases arguing that it could not release legal memos about the drone program, could not release civilian casualty numbers, and for that matter could not even acknowledge that the agency had played any role in targeted killings," Jaffer said.

boyfriend.

Judge Sherry Stephens had been expected to decide on a date for the new penalty phase for Arias over the 2008 murder of Travis Alexander, who was found dead in his shower in a Phoenix suburb, shot in the face and stabbed multiple times with his throat slashed.

Arias was found guilty of the murder in May after a sensational trial that drew national attention with its tale of a soft-spoken young woman accused of such a brutal crime.

But the same jury that convicted her then deadlocked on whether she should be put to death or sentenced to life in prison, and prosecutors are seeking a penalty phase retrial.

At a hearing last month, the judge said she hoped to start jury selection anew in late September. But on Monday, she postponed setting a date to start the process of impaneling a new jury until at least mid-September, when she set another status hearing in the case.

In postponing setting a date, the judge said she needed to deal with pending legal filings in the case.

State prosecutors had previously asked in court filings for the penalty phase to start on July 30. Defense attorneys sought to delay the proceedings until January due to scheduling conflicts and the possibility that Arias might want to call witnesses to speak on her behalf.

Prosecutors have the option of retrying the sentencing phase of the trial, which would require a new jury. If there is another deadlock in the next sentencing phase, a judge would sentence Arias to life in prison, or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.

Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery will continue to seek the death penalty for Arias, a spokesman said on Friday.

The five-month trial, which began in January, was packed with graphic testimony, bloody photographs and sexual situations.

Arias, 33, took the stand for 18 days and maintained throughout that the killing was in self-defense despite fierce cross-examination by prosecutors.

Muriel Siebert, the first woman to own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, has died of complications from cancer, Leonard Leiman, a director at her firm Siebert Financial Corp., said on Sunday. She was 80.

The founder and president of Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. Inc, Siebert purchased her seat on the exchange in 1967, nearly a decade before the next woman would join her there.

Despite credentials including partnerships at two leading brokerages and the founding of her namesake firm, Siebert's initial attempt to gain a seat on exchange was met with sharp opposition and even ridicule by much of its all-male membership, according to her official biography on her company's website. She eventually prevailed.

Known as "Mickie," Siebert made another bold move in 1975, transforming her firm to into a discount brokerage on the first day that New York Stock Exchange members were allowed to negotiate their commissions.

"Mickie was a pioneer and recognized as a leader throughout the financial services industry and beyond," Joseph Ramos, Siebert Financial's chief operating officer, said in a statement. "She was respected as a strong voice of integrity, reason and sound business practices."

Siebert later became the first woman to serve as Superintendent of Banking for the State of New York, accepting the appointment by Governor Hugh Carey in 1977.

An outspoken champion of women and minorities in industry and government, Siebert made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in 1982, losing in the Republican primary to state lawmaker Florence Sullivan.

Sullivan went on to lose to Daniel Patrick Moynihan.



headline: Chicago students begin new term with fewer teachers, schools

largest school system makes do with fewer buildings.

More than 30,000 children on Monday will be directly or indirectly affected by the public school closures - either because they have to go to a new school or because their school is absorbing students from a shuttered building.

The system eliminated 1,581 teaching positions and 1,587 non-teaching positions this summer, but has hired back 1,000 teachers for the school year.

Chicago Public Schools officials have said the cuts to staff and the largest mass school closings in the nation were necessary to help stem a mounting deficit forecast at a record $1 billion in 2014. About a third of the teacher cuts were from closing schools.

The closings have affected mainly Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods. Parents and union leaders have protested, saying more children will have to cross gang territorial lines, leaving them potentially exposed to violence in a city that recorded 506 homicides in 2012.

Chicago Public Schools have hired 1,200 "safe passage" workers to staff school routes to make sure children arrive safely. This summer, there have been three reported homicides along or near those safe-school routes.

In remarks to reporters Monday morning, Mayor Rahm Emanuel spoke of the improvements to the system, including a full day for all kindergarten students.

"Obviously, kids are excited, like any child, upset about the summer being ended, but enthusiastic about the beginning of a new school year," Emanuel said.

Yellow signs mark safe passage routes, but some parents interviewed while walking their children to John B. Drake Elementary School on Monday said they saw signs but not enough workers. Drake's building has been closed and the school now shares a building with another school.

"I don't see that many safe passage people out here at all. I feel like it's a joke," said Rubin Livingston, 28, who said he will walk his son to school himself to ensure his safety. The "safe passage" route to Drake saw a homicide over the summer.

Drake students danced their way into the first day of classes Monday, with a DJ blasting music over a sound system and saying "Welcome back to school, children."

Quaneta Gates, 40, who has a child at Drake, welcomed the new year and said she is positive the transition will work out. Asked if she had concerns about her child's school being housed in a building with children from another school, she said "Life is about new experiences and you're supposed to meet new people."

But Gates said she was disappointed she did not see more safe passage workers on nearby streets.

Union leaders contend the safe passage program is soaking up money that could be spent on social workers, counselors and nurses at schools.

"They've created a problem of student safety and are investing almost exclusively in security at the expense of programs and staff to help students who are facing all sorts of issues," said Jackson Potter, staff coordinator for the Chicago Teachers Union.

The district said that salary increases negotiated last September to settle a strike with the teachers' union contributed to the budget deficit.

Chicago Public Schools serve 403,000 students in 681 schools. But enrollment has been falling for years, in part because people have been moving out of the city with most leaving poor neighborhoods.

Urban school districts have been grappling with declining enrollment across the country, and 70 cities have closed schools over the past decade.



headline: Ohio sees resurgence in meth busts, five years after record low
byline: By Kim Palmer
8:31am EDT

Methamphetamine lab seizures in Ohio have soared more than 400 percent in the past five years, accompanied by a spike in production resulting from new ways of making small quantities of the drug in mobile laboratories, officials said on Sunday.

The sharp rise in drug busts reverses a downward trend that had followed the advent of a tougher law in 2005.

Ohio meth busts reached 635 over the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, which runs from October 1 to September 30, up from a record low 112 in 2008, according to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

Seizures had declined from a high of 444 in to 2005 following the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, which forced retailers of nonprescription products containing pseudoephedrine and other active meth ingredients to place those products behind the counter and required consumers to show identification for each purchase.

A spokeswoman for the Ohio Attorney General's Office confirmed the numbers, first reported in Sunday's Cleveland Plain Dealer.

"We're seeing a continuous spike," Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine told the Plain Dealer. "It is easier (to make the drug). We used to talk about 'meth houses,' or places people would make this. Well today, you can make it in a pop bottle."

The "one pot" or "shake and bake" method uses two-liter bottles and easily available household items.

In neighboring Michigan, those methods accounted for more than 75 percent of all meth labs, according to a 2011 Michigan State Police report.

The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which tracks drug arrests and seizure statistics by federal fiscal year, plans to have final numbers at the end of next month.

The data comes from a voluntary reporting process by law enforcement around the state and does not include many of Ohio's 88 counties, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Attorney General's office said.

The drug seizures are concentrated in a handful of Ohio counties, many of them rural. Nearly one-third of all seizures occurred in Summit County, including the city of Akron, just outside Cleveland, with 191 meth lab seizures.

The counties representing Cleveland and Columbus reported two meth lab seizures each and Cincinnati reported 11.

Nationally there were 11,210 meth labs discovered in 2012, with Ohio ranking sixth among U.S. states. It trailed Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration website.

old World War Two veteran who survived the Battle of Okinawa, police said on Monday.

Kenan Adams-Kinard was taken into custody without incident in Spokane, Washington, overnight on suspicion of first-degree burglary and first-degree murder in the slaying of Delbert Belton, Spokane police said in a statement.

"Good investigative work and follow up on dozens of tips led to the apprehension of the suspect four days after the initial incident," the statement said.

Another 16-year-old suspect in the death, Demetrius Glenn, surrendered to police on Thursday over the killing of Belton, a U.S. Army veteran who was shot in the leg during the Battle of Okinawa as Allied forces began their invasion of Japan's home islands in 1945.

Belton had been waiting in the parking lot of a fraternal lodge on Spokane's north side last Wednesday to meet a friend. The friend arrived to find him in his car, severely beaten in the face and head. The longtime Spokane resident died the following day.

Surveillance videos and still photographs from the lodge and surrounding businesses led police to identify the two teens as suspects.

Police said Adams-Kinard was located in the basement of a Spokane apartment building, and that several other people with him were also arrested for rendering criminal assistance.

Glenn will be advised of the charges against him on Monday afternoon. Adams-Kinard will make his first court appearance on Tuesday.

A New Jersey man has come forward as the third and final winner of the $448 million Powerball jackpot after buying the winning ticket at a South Brunswick supermarket, New Jersey lottery officials said.

Mario Scarnici of Monmouth Junction claimed his share of the prize, which amounts to $86 million before taxes. Two of the three winning tickets in the August 7 drawing were sold in the state, according to a New Jersey Lottery statement released on Friday.

He purchased his ticket from the Super Stop &amp; Shop supermarket in South Brunswick Township.

Jose Perez, a night manager at the Stop &amp; Shop, said the winning ticket has been great for business and that employees are thrilled that the winner came forward to claim his prize.

"We were happy first of all that we sold it," said Perez in a telephone interview. "We sold a ticket before but nobody claimed it."

The store received a $30,000 bonus commission for selling the ticket, and will give that money to charity.

According to a report on the CentralJersey.com web site, Scarnici came forward with his two adult sons to claim his prize. He chose the cash option and will get about $62 million after taxes.

Members of a group of 16 Ocean County maintenance workers with a winning ticket will each receive about $3.8 million after taxes. The group, known as Ocean's 16, bought the Powerball numbers at the Acme Markets in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey.

Scarnici could not be reached for comment, nor could a representative for the state lottery.

Paul White, an engineer from Ham Lake, Minnesota, was the other winner.

The odds of winning the jackpot were about one in 175 million.



headline: Four thousand run from the bulls in Virginia event
byline: By Gary Robertson
8:31am EDT

mile dirt track on Saturday in rural Virginia's version of the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain.

It was the first event of what promoters say will be a national, 10-city bull-running tour modeled on the annual Pamplona event.

"I just didn't want to die, to get trampled by bulls and die," said Cat Jones, 22, who works in engineering and traveled from New York City for the run.

"It was a rush ... a shot of adrenalin," she said.

Jones had such a thrill dodging bulls and watching them race by at breakneck speed that she paid $30 to run again in the afternoon.

The first six runs were conducted with about 500 runners each, chased by 12 bulls, and the last run featured 24 bulls chasing about 700 runners.

About 8,000 people came to watch the runs, said Rob Dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of the Boston-based Great Bull Run. Most of those who signed up were 18 to 40 years old, and about 40 percent were women.

Two runners were taken to the hospital with concussion-like symptoms, according to Great Bull Run. One other runner saw a medic after being knocked down and stepped on by other participants.

Every participant in the race had to sign a waiver, absolving the organizers of liability in case of injury.

Dickens said it was "doing something dangerous and living to tell the tale" that draws participants to the event.

"I wanted to test myself," said Laurie Blaha, 27, of Richmond, Virginia..

Blaha said she passed the test, conquering the fear and nervousness she had before the bulls ran onto the track.

"It was exhilarating," Blaha said. "I would definitely do it again."

Dickens said the only major problem came on the first run of the day, when the initial group of six bulls stopped about midway down the dirt course.

They didn't start running again until six additional bulls were let out of the gates. Dickens said they apparently did not have the confidence to run alone, and needed more company.

After that, he said the staff overseeing the bulls began sending 12 bulls at a time.

In nearly all the runs held during the day, the bulls started slowly and then quickly accelerated to a stampede-like pace.

The Virginia run was set on the grounds of the Virginia Motorsport Park, a drag strip south of Richmond.

Animals rights groups, such as PETA, have protested the Great Bull Run, saying the events puts stress on the animals.

Dickens has said the bulls are not harmed and has invited anyone observing someone abusing the animals to report it.

The next Great Bull Run is scheduled for October 19 in Atlanta. Other cities on the nationwide tour include Houston, Tampa and Los Angeles.



headline: Yosemite wildfire grows, fueling dangerous winds
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

A colossal wildfire raging on the edge of Yosemite National Park has produced dangerous weather patterns by fueling thunderous pyrocumulus clouds that can alter the wind direction rapidly, potentially trapping firefighters, forest officials said on Sunday.

The so-called Rim Fire grew to 134,000 acres by early Sunday morning, up 9,000 acres from the day before, with smoke columns rising more than 30,000 feet, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Dick Fleishman.

"That's a real watch-out situation for our firefighters when they see that kind of activity, they know that the wind could actually move that fire right back on them," Fleishman said. "That's been happening every afternoon."

The fire was threatening power and water supplies to San Francisco, about 200 miles to the west, and scorched part of Yosemite, a park known for its waterfalls, giant sequoia groves and other scenic wonders.

Started on August 17 in the Stanislaus National Forest, the fire remained largely unchecked with extreme terrain and increased wind hampering efforts at containment, Yosemite National Park spokesman Tom Medema said. Seven percent of the wildfire is now contained, he said.

The fire blackened just over 12,000 acres in the northwest corner of Yosemite by Sunday, up marginally from the day before, consuming brush, oaks and pines and threatened some giant sequoia trees in the park, Medema said.

Officials have closed parts of the park's northwestern edge throughout the week, including the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir area, Lake Eleanor, Lake Cherry and the Tuolumne and Merced giant sequoia groves.

The fire by Sunday burned within 3 miles of the reservoir and was still 20 miles from Yosemite Valley, the park's main tourist center, Medema said. About 2,700 firefighters were expected to be on the front lines on Sunday to fight the fire.

Officials said they have no plans to shut down the entire park or its top attractions.

California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday declared a state of emergency for San Francisco, saying the fire had damaged the electrical infrastructure serving the city and forced the Public Utilities Commission to shut down power lines.

The Hetch Hetchy Reservoir provides water to 2.6 million customers in the San Francisco area and Brown in his declaration said the city's water supply could be affected if the blaze harms the reservoir, most likely by contaminating its water with ash.

There was no evidence of ash in the reservoir by Saturday evening, said Tyrone Jue, spokesman for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.

San Francisco could draw on water from neighbors if the supply is compromised, he said.

DROUGHT-PARCHED WEST

Yosemite, one of the nation's major tourist destinations, attracted nearly 4 million visitors last year. The park has been posting updates and alerts on its website. (<a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>)

The blaze in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains is now the fastest-moving of 50 large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West. The blazes have strained resources and prompted fire managers to open talks with Pentagon commanders and Canadian officials about possible reinforcements.

A 111,000-acre fire near the resort town of Sun Valley in central Idaho was 82 percent contained on Sunday as the number of firefighters assigned to the blaze was reduced to several hundred from a high of 1,800, officials said.

At its height a week ago, the blaze forced the evacuation of 2,250 homes in upscale developments in a scenic river valley known for a world-class ski resort and for premier hiking and biking trails that wind through the Sawtooth Mountains.

The Rim Fire had destroyed 11 homes, 12 outbuildings and four commercial properties by Sunday.

Evacuation advisories were lifted for roughly 2,500 residences in two Tuolumne County communities on Saturday, but at least 2,000 households were under evacuation advisories, Fleishman said.

Highway 120, one of four access routes to Yosemite, was temporarily closed. The highway leads to the west side of the 750,000-acre (300,000-hectare) national park.

The 2013 fire season has already drained U.S. Forest Service fire suppression and emergency funds, causing the agency to redirect $600 million meant for other projects like campground and trail maintenance and thinning of trees to reduce wildfire risks, agency spokesman Mike Ferris has said.



headline: Judge to rule on San Bernardino bankruptcy, pensions loom
byline: By Tim Reid
8:31am EDT

an important test for the federal law used by Detroit and other U.S. cities burdened by pension payment costs.

Most observers expect federal bankruptcy judge Meredith Jury to rule that cash-strapped San Bernardino, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, is eligible for Chapter 9 protection, a year after it declared bankruptcy having effectively run out of cash to meet its day-to-day obligations.

A city of just 240,000, San Bernardino could be a precursor for what is shaping up as a central issue in the far bigger bankruptcy case of Detroit: whether an insolvent city can cut already-promised pensions for its workers and pay less into its public retirement funds.

In an unprecedented move, San Bernardino halted its biweekly payments to the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) for an entire year after declaring bankruptcy last August.

San Bernardino has now resumed payments to Calpers, America's biggest pension fund and San Bernardino's largest creditor, but no city has ever halted employer payments to Calpers before. The $260 billion pension fund is the only party objecting to San Bernardino's bankruptcy, saying that pension funds should not be treated like other creditors. Calpers may appeal the eligibility decision.

In Detroit, which last month filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, estimated at $18.5 billion, the state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, has already called for cuts to current and future pension benefits in any bankruptcy plan. Unions representing workers have objected to the bankruptcy by arguing that it contravenes benefits' protection enshrined in Michigan's state constitution.

LIKE A LAB TEST FOR DETROIT

In both San Bernardino and Detroit, the idea of cutting back pension payments has set up a high-stakes battle between Wall Street bondholders and state pension funds over how they are treated when cities run out of money - an issue that could eventually find its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

"There is a real parallel between San Bernardino and Detroit," said Michael Sweet, a bankruptcy attorney with Fox Rothschild in San Francisco, who is not representing any party in the San Bernardino or Detroit cases.

"Both cities have shown an appetite to take the pension issue head-on. If the judge rules San Bernardino eligible for bankruptcy, it opens the way for the city to propose a plan that could impair Calpers - which could put this little city ahead of what is happening in Detroit."

Calpers has taken the opposite stance in the case of Stockton, another California city, which was found eligible for bankruptcy in April. Stockton has kept current on all payments to the pension fund.

The judge overseeing the Stockton case has said that the question of whether Calpers remains to be paid in full under a bankruptcy plan could become an important issue when the city presents its exit plan.

James Spiotto, a municipal bankruptcy specialist and a partner at Chapman &amp; Cutler in Chicago, said the issue for San Bernardino - and other cities in bankruptcy - is simple: it comes down to what they can feasibly pay creditors under a bankruptcy plan.

"If San Bernardino has to pay everything it owes to Calpers - can they survive as a municipality?"



headline: U.S. authorities probe killing of grizzly bear near Yellowstone
byline: By Laura and Zuckerman
8:31am EDT

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is investigating the killing of a grizzly bear near Yellowstone National Park in eastern Idaho, not far from where a grizzly attacked two biologists this month, state wildlife officials said on Saturday.

It is generally illegal to kill grizzlies in the 48 contiguous states, where the bears are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. But the law does allow the animals to be killed if they are threatening humans.

The caretaker of a residence near the park shot the grizzly on Friday night, said Gregg Losinski, regional conservation educator with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.

The caretaker was armed with a high-powered rifle while at the home because a grizzly had previously torn down a bird feeder on the property and eaten the seeds, Losinski said.

State wildlife biologists have collected tissue samples from the bear for DNA testing to compare with fur taken from a site nearby where a grizzly startled from sleep charged and bit two biologists on August 15.

Also on that day, a mother grizzly attacked and wounded two hikers who unexpectedly encountered the bear's cub, park officials said.

Grizzly and human conflicts happen mostly in the autumn when the bears are driven to seek food in order to bulk up before hibernation, said Losinski.

About 600 bears roam Yellowstone and its border states of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.



headline: In bustling Houston, it's a case of 'Build, baby, build!'
byline: By Anna Driver and Ilaina Jonas
8:31am EDT

With Texas one of the few bright spots in the U.S. economy, the skyline of swaggering Houston is where the action is as builders and global oil companies, from Phillips 66 to Exxon Mobil Corp, look past previous busts and spend billions on gleaming new buildings.

The U.S. shale oil and gas revolution - which has already changed industries from railroads to pipelines and refineries - is helping drive the voracious appetite for office space needed for the expanding workforce in the world's energy capital.

Demand is so hot that Houston is one of the few places where banks - including Wells Fargo &amp; Co, which is seen as one of the more conservative big banks - will loan money for a new building without demanding developers first have a tenant.

"Houston is booming and bar none the strongest market in the United States of America," said Joseph Sitt, chief executive of Thor Equities, which has two projects underway in Houston.

There are some 56 office buildings totaling at least 11 million square feet under construction in and around Houston, according to real estate services firm CBRE Group Inc. That is equivalent to 190 football fields.

In the forested suburbs, Exxon has what it calls "one of the largest commercial construction projects underway in North America." The nearly 400-acre campus with 20 buildings will have enough room for 10,000 employees.

With crude now above $100 a barrel, money is flowing freely. And while the shale oil and gas transformation means North America may be energy independent by the end of this decade, economists are wary when people say this boom will be different. They counsel caution.

"The Texas oil and gas industry is not known for long periods of stability," Karr Ingham, economist for the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers. "Nobody wants what happened (in past busts) to happen again."

To be sure, the amount of space being built is still only a fraction of the 88.9 million square feet developers constructed in Houston from 1980 through 1986, a flurry that more than doubled the city's office market, according to real estate research firm Reis Inc.

The Texas economy grew 4.8 percent last year, the fastest pace among the big U.S. states. New workers are pouring into Houston, which needs new offices for the 100,000 jobs it added last year. Houston is on track to add another 80,000 this year.

But over-exuberance about real estate and oil have afflicted Houston before. In the early 1980s developers built a 71-story green glass tower with a footprint shaped like a dollar sign.

It took nearly two decades to recover from Houston's big crash in the 1980s, which was brought on by a collapse in oil prices. Vacancy rates soared to near 30 percent in 1983 from 9.8 percent two years prior, according to Reis.

The current building cycle is in large part propelled by burgeoning domestic production of oil and natural gas unlocked from shale formations through hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.

"If you are investing in Houston, you're a believer in the energy sector long term, which we are," said Russell Cooper, managing director of capital transactions at Shorenstein Properties LLC in San Francisco.

The firm in January bought a building of more than one million square feet in downtown Houston from Exxon for $48 million. It plans to put a new glass skin on the building and may connect it to the air-conditioned tunnel system downtown, where office workers eat and shop to escape torrential rains and steamy heat.

Exxon has put two other buildings in Houston and one in Virginia up for sale, ahead of the move to its new campus.

ENERGY CORRIDOR

Tower cranes dot the landscape of Houston's so-called energy corridor, about 15 miles from downtown. The area, located on the western edge of the city, is experiencing rapid growth as companies build and expand. There, refining company Phillips 66 is constructing a 14-acre campus with over a million square feet for its 1,800 employees.

Firms are loading their blueprints with plans for everything from basketball courts to childcare centers and fancy coffee shops to attract hard-to-find energy experts.

Near the Exxon campus, an entire master-planned community called Springwoods Village with room for up to 5,000 houses and apartments is going up to accommodate new workers.

While others construct facilities for employees, some companies are building space to push the frontiers of oil technology.

BP Plc is spending more than $100 million over the next five years to build a new three-story building that will house the huge supercomputing complex used to speed up BP's search for oil and gas around the world.

"It made more sense to create a new home," said Keith Gray, manager of BP's High Performance Computing unit. "It became clear that a freestanding building was needed to address growth needs."

Other oil and gas companies with buildings under construction or in preliminary stages in Houston include BHP Billiton Petroleum, Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron Corp, which plans a 50-story tower downtown.

One building which started on spec - meaning banks loan money for construction even if a tenant isn't lined up - is the 550,000-square-foot Energy Center Three in west Houston.

Principal Real Estate Investors, part of Principal Financial Group, and developer Trammell Crow Co started the building with a loan of roughly $100 million from a Wells Fargo-led syndicate.

Within four months, oil company ConocoPhillips signed a lease for the entire building and half of Energy Center Four, which is not yet under construction, said Aaron Thielhorn, managing director of Trammell Crow's Houston business unit.

Brian Stoffers, president of CBRE Capital Markets, said spec building in Houston in many ways makes it an outlier.

"The dynamics of the Houston market are so robust right now that it's the exception to the economic rule around the rest of the country," he said.

Of the buildings under construction, 29 will be rentals that will not be owner-occupied. Of those, 13 broke ground without signed leases but six of those have since found tenants.

Vacancy rates in the most expensive, modern office buildings in Houston are tumbling. Second-quarter vacancy slid to 6.9 percent from 12 percent in the same period two years ago, according to CBRE. The broader office vacancy rate is 14.2 percent versus a national average of 17 percent.

DANGER AHEAD?

While access to shale deposits has diminished worries about supplies, much of the new demand for crude oil in recent years has been led by developing nations such as China and India.

Big slowdowns in those developing economies could hit the price of crude and cool enthusiasm for building in Houston.

"If China and India have hit a plateau, then I think we have to ask where are the drivers for oil demand in the future," said the University of Houston's Robert Gilmer.

Chinese growth slowed to 7.5 percent in the second quarter - below the 8.9 percent average of the last six years.

Apart from shale, crude oil prices generally need to stay above $65 per barrel to produce from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico or the oilsands in Canada for companies to make money.

Another risk is overbuilding. Houston, a sprawling 8,778-square-mile metropolis, has no zoning restrictions, a fact that has some investors including New York-based GreenOak Real Estate Advisors, looking elsewhere to buy.

Owners in areas where building is constrained can reap big rewards when demand for space rises, fueling rent spikes of sometimes 20 percent. That rarely happens in Houston, where developers can easily build.

"When you're dealing with a market like Houston, there's nothing to hold developers back," Ryan Severino, Reis senior economist said. "You can literally can go next door and put up a building."



headline: Service held for mother, brother of abducted California teenager

8:31am EDT

Hannah Anderson, the Southern California teenager whose alleged abductor authorities say killed her mother and brother, wiped away tears on Saturday at a memorial service for her slain family.

Some 250 people attended the service for Christina Anderson, 44, and her son Ethan, 8, at the Guardian Angels Roman Catholic Church about 20 miles east of San Diego.

It was held two weeks after a multi-state search for Anderson, 16, and her suspected kidnapper, James Lee DiMaggio, 40, ended at a mountain lake in the Idaho wilderness, where an FBI agent shot and killed DiMaggio.

Police say that, before driving off with Hannah, the family friend-turned-abductor lured Christina Anderson and Ethan to his home in Boulevard near San Diego and killed them.

Their bodies were discovered on August 4 in the wreckage of the property, which DiMaggio is believed to have set ablaze with the aid of a timer.

"Ethan was a handsome little guy with spirit, the kind of guy you'd want for a son, a brother, a friend," the boy's great-uncle, Dave Braun, told those in attendance.

Braun described Christina Anderson as a "wonderful mother and friend" who was always ready to help people. "We will miss them forever and always think of them," he said.

The Anderson family lived in Lakeside near San Diego.

The slayings and kidnapping made national headlines and triggered one of the most widespread Amber Alerts in the history of the system used to notify motorists of a kidnapping.

DiMaggio and Anderson were photographed in his car at 12:10 a.m. on August 4, some 20 hours before DiMaggio's house went up in flames. Anderson later told NBC News in an interview that aired on "Today" that DiMaggio had picked her up the previous day from her cheerleading camp.

"Our prayers were answered for the safe return of Hannah and true justice was served that day by the FBI," Braun said. "Now we turn our thoughts to healing."

Authorities have not publicly discussed any possible motives for DiMaggio's alleged actions. Braun told reporters that DiMaggio had developed an apparent infatuation with the high school student that had made Hannah uncomfortable.

Braun noted that it was particularly troubling that his niece and great-nephew were killed by a close family friend.

"We are still shocked by that," Braun said. "We are concerned now about Hannah and how she'll recover from this."

headline: Fifty years later, U.S. marchers urge fulfillment of King's 'dream'
byline: By Doug Palmer and Ian Simpson
8:31am EDT

Tens of thousands of marchers converged on Washington on Saturday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech and to urge action on jobs, voting rights and gun violence.

"We believe in a new America. It's time to march for a new America," civil rights leader Al Sharpton told the predominantly black crowd from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

Sharpton and other speakers paid tribute to King and other civil rights leaders for progress over the past five decades that led to significant gains, including Barack Obama's election as the first black U.S. president.

But the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida last year and the Supreme Court's recent decision to strike down a portion of the nation's voting rights law showed the struggle was not over, they said.

"King saw the possibility of an Obama 50 years ago. The world is made of dreamers that change reality because of their dream. And what we must do is we must give our young people dreams again," Sharpton said.

The "National Action to Realize the Dream" was led by Sharpton and Martin Luther King III, King's oldest son.

"We ain't going to let nobody turn us around. We're going to keep marching down to freedom land," King told the crowd. "I know that Daddy is smiling up above knowing that your presence here today will assure the fulfillment of his dream."

Organizers expected 100,000 people to attend the rally and march from the Lincoln Memorial in the National Mall to the Washington Monument, passing by the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial.

The National Park Service does not make crowd estimates and organizers did not immediately respond to request for their own.

Under a bright blue sky, a huge throng of people crowded both sides of the 2,000-foot-long (610-metre) reflecting pool east of the Lincoln Memorial.

More than 40 groups participated in the march, among them the Service Employees International Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Federation of Teachers. It aimed to call attention to job opportunities, voting rights, gun violence, women's rights and immigration reform.

Despite big gains politically and in education, nearly half of those who responded to a poll by the Pew Research Center in Washington, think far more needs to be done to achieve the color-blind society that King envisioned.

King was among six organizers of the 1963 march, and led about 250,000 people to the Lincoln Memorial and delivered his "I have a dream" speech from its steps.

'SO MUCH HATE'

The speech and march helped spur passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act in 1964 and 1965, respectively.

King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. He was assassinated on April 4, 1968 at age 39.

That is still a bitter memory for Velma Lois Jones, an 82-year-old former math teacher from Memphis, Tennessee, who participated in the first march 50 years ago and was back on Saturday to help keep King's dream alive.

"I was down at the Mason Temple where he was going to speak that night, waiting for him to come, when I got the news. And it was a devastation," Jones said.

"We've got so much hate in this country that eradicating it will never end," she said. "But the fact that I'm here says I have hope that things are going to be better."

Obama is scheduled to speak on Wednesday at a ceremony marking the actual anniversary of the march at the Lincoln Memorial. The commemoration will include a nationwide ringing of bells at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT).

Charles Wise a 61-year-old nurse, said he traveled from Brotmanville, New Jersey with his wife for the march because "the way things are going, participation is required."

"You can't stand on the sidelines and hope things get better. You have to get out and make them get better. When they start to go after voting rights, as many of us that died for those, the answer is 'hell no,'" Wise said.

Harrison Hawkins, a retired Smithsonian museum worker who celebrated his 70th birthday this week, remembered there was far less security at the 1963 march.

While most of the crowd on Saturday was kept at a distance from the Lincoln Memorial, Hawkins said 50 years ago "you could walk around here. There wasn't anybody stopping you. I got up on the steps" to listen to King's speech.

Like others at the march, Hawkins acknowledged that black Americans have much more freedom than they did in the early 1960s and said he still marvels that a black man has become president.

"There's been a lot of changes, but there needs to be a lot more. The Congress needs to let Barack Obama do his job ... They're holding him back. They won't let him do anything just because he's a black man," Hawkins said.

Many young blacks were outraged by the Trayvon Martin case and what they see as an assault on voting rights, but said they also were worried about finding a job to pay off tens of thousands of dollars of student debt.

"Right now, I work part time, but it doesn't pay for anything," said Naada Boulandi, a 29-year-old aspiring interior designer from Silver Spring, Maryland, who graduated from college in May.

Mel Wilson, manager for social justice and human rights for the National Association of Social Workers, said that is a problem that many minorities face.

"We still deal with massive unemployment, disproportionate unemployment among black and Hispanic youth and that needs to change," the 66-year-old said.



headline: Former head of failed Alaska dairy indicted for fraud
byline: By Yereth Rosen
8:31am EDT

The head of a defunct Alaska dairy that was created partly with the assets of a public dairy under the oversight of former Gov. Sarah Palin has been indicted for allegedly bilking the state for $430,000 in fraudulent agricultural loans.

Karen Olson of Wasilla, former chief executive of the now-defunct Matanuska Creamery, was indicted on Friday by a federal grand jury on three counts of wire fraud, plus mail fraud and making false statements to influence the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Olson's indictment came eight months after her former business partner, Kyle Beus, was accused in a federal court indictment of defrauding the Agriculture Department of $643,000 in agricultural grants that prosecutors said in part went to personal purposes rather than the faltering dairy.

The Matanuska Creamery in Palmer, Alaska, opened in 2008, in large part from assets of the state-owned Matanuska Maid dairy that went out of business in 2007. The private creamery received several government loans and grants before shutting down at the end of 2012.

Although Olson and Beus were business partners and the , charges against the two are similar, the cases are separate, Assistant U.S. Attorney Retta Randall said. Beus is scheduled to go to trial in September in Anchorage federal court.

If convicted, Olson faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine, Randall said.

Palin was not implicated in the criminal case, Randall said, although the collapse of the Matanuska Creamery is considered a blot on her gubernatorial record.

Palin was governor when the dairy, which was then owned by the state, announced plans to go out of business in 2007 and she fired its board and replaced it with a new one. Palin approved state grants to keep the dairy in business but it failed and many of its assets went to create a new private dairy. That dairy failed last year.

Palin's Alaska critics accused her of botched management and of favoring her Wasilla-area friends over experienced business people. Palin said at the time her goal was to ensure a smooth privatization to keep local dairy farmers in business.

Beus' attorney could not be reached immediately for comment and public court documents did not list an attorney for Olson.



headline: Wildfire enters Yosemite, threatens San Francisco water, power
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

moving wildfire raging on the edge of Yosemite National Park that is threatening power and water supplies to San Francisco about 200 miles to the west.

The so-called Rim Fire, which had grown to just over 125,000 acres as of early Saturday, remained largely unchecked with extreme terrain hampering efforts at containment.

"We are making progress but unfortunately the steep terrain definitely has posed a major challenge," said Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

"Today we're continuing to see warm weather that could allow this fire to continue to grow very rapidly as it has over the last several days," Berlant said. He described the fire as the 16th largest on record in California.

California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday declared a state of emergency, warning that the fire had damaged the electrical infrastructure serving the city, and forced the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission to shut down power lines.

There have been no reports of blackouts in San Francisco.

Ashley Taylor, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service, said high humidity and firefighting efforts through the night had helped some.

"Firefighters are still working with the same difficult situation, and they're really taking every opportunity they can to take hold of this fire," Taylor said. "They're working very hard to take this down."

The Hetch Hetchy Reservoir provides water to 2.6 million customers in the San Francisco area, and Brown in his declaration said the city's water supply could be affected if the blaze affects the reservoir.

The Hetch Hetchy watershed provides about 85 percent of San Francisco's total water needs, according to the Western Urban Water Coalition, organization of largest water suppliers in western United States.

The fire on Saturday remained about 4 miles west of the reservoir and more than 20 miles from Yosemite Valley, the park's main tourist center, Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman said.

The fire was consuming brush, oaks and pine and was about 5 percent contained as of Saturday.

The fire had blackened about 12,000 acres in the northwestern corner of Yosemite as of Friday.

Berlant said about 2,700 firefighters were expected to be on the front lines on Saturday to fight the fire, which started on August 17 in the Stanislaus National Forest.

DROUGHT PARCHED

Yosemite, one of the nation's major tourist destinations, attracted nearly 4 million visitors last year. The park has been posting updates and alerts on its website. (Alerts: <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>)

The blaze in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains is now the fastest-moving of 50 large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West that have strained resources and prompted fire managers to open talks with Pentagon commanders and Canadian officials about possible reinforcements.

Taylor said there had been one reported injury, a heat-related injury to a firefighter, due to the fire. About 4,500 residences, three commercial buildings and 1,000 outbuildings are currently threatened by the fire, she said.

An American Red Cross shelter at the Mother Lode Fairgrounds in Tuolumne County located north and west of the fire had 184 people on Saturday, spokesman Jordan Scott said.

Campers forced from Stanislaus National Forest had taken shelter there earlier in the week, but the fairgrounds shelter now had people forced to leave area homes, he said.

"People coming in are obviously concerned about their home and their situation," but their spirits have been "generally upbeat," Scott said in a telephone interview.

Taylor said there is no plan to close Yosemite National Park due to the fire. However, park officials have closed areas in its northwestern edge throughout the week, including the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir area, Lake Eleanor, Lake Cherry and Tuolumne Grove of Giant Sequoias.

Highway 120, one of four access routes to Yosemite, which is known for its waterfalls, giant sequoia groves and other scenic wonders, was temporarily closed. The highway leads to the west side of the 750,000-acre (300,000-hectare) national park.

The 2013 fire season has already drained U.S. Forest Service fire suppression and emergency funds, causing the agency to redirect $600 million meant for other projects like campground and trail maintenance and thinning of trees to reduce wildfire risks, agency spokesman Mike Ferris has said.

The service has spent some $967 million to protect lives and properties amid a season that has seen fires in Idaho, Utah, Colorado and California threaten homes and communities that border forest and wild lands where fire is more dangerous and costly to fight, Ferris said.



headline: Four thousand run from the bulls in Virginia event
byline: By Gary Robertson
8:31am EDT

mile dirt track on Saturday in rural Virginia's version of the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain.

It was the first event of what promoters say will be a nationwide, 10-city bull-running tour modeled on the annual Pamplona event.

"I just didn't want to die, to get trampled by bulls and die," said Cat Jones, 22, who works in engineering and traveled from New York City for the run.

"It was a rush ... a shot of adrenalin," she said.

Jones had such a thrill dodging bulls and watching them race by at break-neck speed that she paid $30 to run again in the afternoon.

The first six runs were conducted with about 500 runners each, chased by 12 bulls, and the last run featured 24 bulls chasing about 700 runners.

About 8,000 people came to watch the runs, said Rob Dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of the Boston-based Great Bull Run. Most of those who signed up were 18 to 40 years old, and about 40 percent were women.

At least one runner suffered an injury that required a trip to a hospital. Another went to see a medic after being knocked down and stepped on by other runners.

Every participant in the race had to sign a waiver, absolving the organizers of liability should they be injured.

Dickens said it was "doing something dangerous and living to tell the tale" that draws participants to the event.

That was what drew Laurie Blaha, 27, of Richmond, Virginia. "I wanted to test myself," she said.

Blaha said she passed the test, conquering the fear and nervousness she had before the bulls ran onto the track.

"It was exhilarating," Blaha said. "I would definitely do it again."

Dickens said the only major problem came on the first run of the day, when the initial group of six bulls stopped about midway down the quarter-mile dirt course.

They didn't start running again until six additional bulls were let out of the gates. Dickens said they apparently didn't have the confidence to run alone, and needed more company.

After that, he said the staff overseeing the bulls began sending 12 bulls at a time.

In nearly all the runs held during the day, the bulls started slowly and then quickly accelerated to a stampede-like pace.

The Virginia run was set on the grounds of the Virginia Motorsport Park, a drag strip south of Richmond that offered spectators State Fair food such as fried Oreos and foot-long corn dogs.

Animals rights groups, such as PETA, have protested the Great Bull Run, saying the events puts stress on the animals.

Dickens has said the bulls are not harmed and has invited anyone observing someone abusing the animals to report it.

The next Great Bull Run is scheduled for October 19 in Atlanta. Other cities on the nationwide tour include Houston, Tampa and Los Angeles.



headline: Non-citizens could serve on California juries under bill passed Fri
byline: By Sharon Bernstein
8:31am EDT

Immigrants who are legally in the United States but not citizens would be allowed to serve on juries in California under a bill passed by the state legislature on Friday.

As written, the bill does not expressly require all lawful permanent residents to serve on juries, but many lawmakers said they assumed it would become mandatory.

The bill would allow immigrants to be included in the pool of potential jurors if they were permanent legal residents of the United States and live in California. Since those called for jury duty are expected to serve, some lawmakers said that right could become an obligation.

Governor Jerry Brown has not yet said whether he will sign the measure, which supporters said would increase the pool of people available to serve on juries while also increasing the rights and responsibilities of immigrants.

The bill's sponsor, Democratic Assemblyman Bob Wieckowski, likened the rules disqualifying immigrants who are permanent residents from jury service to long-discarded laws that kept blacks and women from serving.

"What we look for in jurors are characteristics like integrity, honesty, impartiality and the willingness to listen to all the evidence before coming to a conclusion," said Wieckowski, who represents the San Francisco Bay Area suburb of Fremont. "Lawful permanent residents, who live in the same county and speak English, can serve effectively as jurors."

But Rocky Chavez, a Republican who represents part of San Diego County, said allowing non-citizens on juries could deprive defendants of their right to have their case decided by a jury of their peers.

"Not everywhere is innocent until proven guilty," Chavez said during debate on the bill. "In some countries, it's guilty until proven innocent."

Such cultural differences could affect how an immigrant viewed a case, he said. In addition, he said, immigrants who have chosen to live in the United States without taking on the mantle of citizenship might find jury service onerous.

"I have lived overseas," he said. "I wouldn't want to serve on a jury in Japan."

The bill passed on a largely party line vote with three Democrats joining Republicans in opposition.

headline: Lawyer for George Zimmerman chides him for visiting gun factory
byline: By Barbara Liston
8:31am EDT

George Zimmerman's lawyer has chided him for visiting a Florida firearms factory that makes the type of gun he used to kill unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin last year.

Zimmerman in July was acquitted of murder in Martin's death in a racially charged case that polarized the U.S. public and raised questions about Florida's loose gun laws and equal justice.

"We understand how George visiting the factory that produces the gun used to shoot Trayvon Martin is seen as inappropriate," Shawn Vincent, spokesman for Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara, told Reuters on Friday.

Celebrity news website TMZ posted a photo of Zimmerman at the Kel-Tec plant in Cocoa, shaking hands with an employee and grinning.

The website reported that he asked questions about the legality of buying a Kel-Tec KSG, a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun.

Zimmerman, 29, shot Martin, who was 17 years old, in the heart with a 9mm Kel-Tec pistol.

Zimmerman was a volunteer watchman for a gated community in central Florida when he killed Martin in February 2012.

Martin was walking back to the town house where he was staying after a trip to a nearby convenience store to buy Skittles candy and a can of iced tea.

Prosecutors argued that Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, profiled Martin as a criminal, pursued him and killed him. Zimmerman said Martin attacked him and that he acted in self-defense.

Less than three weeks after his acquittal, Zimmerman was stopped for speeding on a Texas highway 25 miles southeast of Dallas, and notified the officer that he was carrying a gun in his glove compartment, according to Texas officials.



headline: San Diego mayor announces resignation over scandal
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, facing a sexual harassment lawsuit and numerous allegations of inappropriate behavior toward women, said on Friday that he would resign in a speech before the City Council.

Addressing the council after members emerged from a closed meeting where they discussed a proposed settlement over how to handle the lawsuit by the mayor's former press secretary, Filner said his resignation would be effective August 30.

A Democratic former congressman elected last year to lead California's second-largest city, he had faced mounting pressure to step down over behavior toward women he has acknowledged was unsuitable.

While Filner, 70, pledged to resign, his speech to a room full of reporters, accompanied by occasional cheers from supporters, was also defiant at times as he described being forced out of office.

"My own personal failures were responsible," Filner said. "I'm sorry I let you down."



headline: New Mexico judge orders clerk to issue same-sex marriage licenses

sex couples the right to wed.

The New Mexico decision ended a lawsuit filed by two men, Alex Hanna and Yon Hudson, after they were refused a marriage license by the clerk of Santa Fe County earlier this year.

"It is the first time that a judge in New Mexico has determined that the constitution and laws of New Mexico require marriage equality," said Brian Egolf, a lawyer and state legislator who represented Hanna and Hudson. "We're very excited for our clients."

Thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage.

In her ruling, which was issued late Thursday, District Judge Sarah Singleton said there was nothing in New Mexico's law or constitution prohibiting same-sex marriage.

She ordered the Santa Fe county clerk, Geraldine Salazar, to begin issuing licenses to same-sex couples or appear in court to explain why she shouldn't have to.

On Friday, Salazar complied. She said she had always supported gay marriage, but feared that the licenses would be considered illegal.

"I am a fervent supporter of same-sex marriage in New Mexico and have always believed that the restrictive and antiquated statutes in our state must fall to the principles of equal protection embodied in our constitution," Salazar said in a statement Friday.

Couples began gathering in her office Friday afternoon, amid cheers, laughter, tears and hugs.

In 2004, the county clerk in Sandoval County, New Mexico, began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but stopped doing so after the state attorney general said gay marriage was not legal in New Mexico.

The case that prompted this week's ruling was one of several filed recently in New Mexico on the question of same-sex marriage. The state Supreme Court was initially asked to rule on them, but asked lower courts to handle them first.

Two women who sued in one of the other suits, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, were also married on Friday with a license issued in Santa Fe by Salazar.

Jen Roper and Angelique Neuman were married in the Christus St. Vincent cancer center where Roper was undergoing treatment, the ACLU said in a press release.

"We are so very happy to be officially married after 21 years together," Roper said in a statement. "Now we just ask that the courts move quickly to ensure that our marriages are fully recognized and respected by the state."

A county clerk in southern New Mexico had already begun issuing licenses in advance of the ruling.

"Maybe I'm jumping the gun, but so be it," said Do単a Ana County Clerk Lynn Ellins on Wednesday. "Equal protection should apply to everyone."

headline: U.S. soldier who killed Afghan villagers gets life without parole
byline: By Eric M. Johnson
8:31am EDT

A decorated American soldier was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on Friday for killing 16 unarmed Afghan civilians, mostly women and children, in two bloody nighttime forays from his military post.

Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, a veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, has admitted to slaughtering the villagers in attacks on their family compounds in Kandahar province in March 2012.

He pleaded guilty to the killings in June in a deal that spared him the death penalty, and a sentencing jury of six military personnel deliberated less than two hours on Friday before deciding he should spend the rest of his life in prison.

Bales, who appeared in a military court in Washington state in blue military dress, showed no emotion as the verdict was handed down, but his mother cried and rocked back and forth.

Army prosecutors said Bales acted alone and with premeditation when, armed with a pistol, a rifle and a grenade launcher, he left his outpost twice during the night, returning in the middle of his rampage to tell a fellow soldier, "I just shot up some people."

The killings marked the worst case of civilian deaths blamed on a rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in Afghanistan.

"He wiped out generations and he ruined lives forever," prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Jay Morse told the jury in his closing arguments. "He should be known by one official title from this day until the day he dies: inmate."

In arguing for life without parole, Morse told jurors that Bales lacked a moral compass, and played video in which Bales could be seen returning to base on the day of the killings, cloaked in a blanket snatched during the rampage.

"This is the walk of a cold blooded killer," Morse said.

Defense attorneys had contended that Bales carried out the killings after suffering a breakdown under the pressure of the last of his four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. They said he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before shipping off to Kandahar province.

"We won the case when we got the death penalty off the table," John Henry Browne, one of Bales' attorneys, said in a statement after the sentence was handed down, adding the defense would mount an automatic appeal.

'WE DIDN'T GET OUR WISH'

Some Afghan survivors of the attack and family members of the victims who had been flown to the United States to testify about the impact of the shooting later expressed disappointment at a news conference that the penalty was not stronger.

"This murderer jumped into my house in the middle of the night, killed 11 members of my family and then burned them," said villager Hajji Mohammad Wazir, who lost his wife and six of his seven children, among other relatives, in the attacks.

"We were brought all the way here from Afghanistan to see if justice would be served. But not our way. The justice was served (in the) American way, their way," he said. "We wanted this murderer to be executed but we didn't get our wish."

Bales' sentencing came the same day a separate military jury convicted U.S. Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan of killing 13 people in 2009 when he walked into a medical facility at Fort Hood, Texas, and opened fire on unarmed soldiers with a laser-sighted handgun. He could face the death penalty.

Prior to the sentencing, Bales told the jury on Thursday he had struggled with anger issues that worsened after his third military deployment, but that he had tried to disguise his problems behind a veneer of normalcy. He said he briefly sought treatment before his final deployment but stopped after he felt it was not working.

He also apologized, both to his fellow servicemen and to the Afghan villagers, for the killings, saying: "What I did is an act of cowardice behind a mask of fear, bullshit and bravado."

In seeking the possibility of parole for Bales, civilian defense attorney Emma Scanlan had tried to persuade the jury to look at Bales' life in entirety while deciding on an appropriate sentence.

"We don't throw out the first 38 years," Scanlan said. "That doesn't mean, again, that there is anything about this that is not completely horrific."

Scanlan read a letter Bales wrote to his children and family before the attack in which he compared Afghan children to his own, saying they love "to eat candy and play soccer."

"Those aren't the words of a cold-blooded murderer who likes to kill innocent women and children," Scanlan said.

government movement, authorities said on Friday.

Undercover officers met with David Brutsche, 42, and his roommate Devon Newman, 67, more than 30 times, during which the suspects said they wanted to capture a police officer during a routine traffic stop, according to a police report.

Brutsche and Newman then planned to hold the officer in a makeshift jail and conduct a trial in what they considered a "sovereign court of law," the report said.

The suspects, arrested on Tuesday, intended to kill the officer after the trial, douse the body with bleach and vinegar and dispose of it in the Nevada desert, police said.

Police initiated the investigation of Brutsche in April when officers who came in contact with the man heard him "espouse the beliefs and ideology of the sovereign citizen movement," Lieutenant Jim Seebock of the Las Vegas Police Department's Counter-Terrorism Section told reporters.

Brutsche said "he was not subject to the laws of Clark County" where he lived "nor the United States," Seebock said.

Adherents of the "sovereign citizen" movement believe individuals are sovereign nations, and federal, state and local laws do not apply to them.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, said the number of hard-core believers in sovereign citizen principles may be 100,000 based on the number of tax protesters in the country.

Las Vegas police said Brutsche and Newman discussed their plans with undercover officers posing as sovereign citizen supporters, and the two had already set up a makeshift prison in the master bedroom of a private residence two days before they were arrested.

"The suspects further believed that once the first kidnapping and execution was accomplished, they would be compelled to keep repeating their actions, kidnapping and killing multiple officers," Seebock told reporters.

The two are charged with conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and attempted kidnapping with a deadly weapon, said Tess Driver, spokeswoman for the Clark County District Attorney's Office.

They have not entered a plea to the charges, but a preliminary hearing at a Las Vegas court is scheduled for September 9, Driver said. Prosecutors said they had not yet calculated the maximum sentence the suspects could face if convicted.

Brutsche's lawyer in the Public Defender's Office and Newman's attorney Carl Arnold could not be reached for comment.

In a jailhouse interview with local station KTNV, Newman denied the charges.

She said she wanted people to "to realize that our freedoms are being eroded. I want them to stand up for themselves and demand that the government apply the Constitution."

Newman and Brutsche are being held without bail at Clark County jail, Driver said.

old World War Two veteran who survived the Battle of Okinawa, police in Spokane, Washington, said on Friday.

Demetrius Glenn was taken into custody on suspicion of first-degree robbery and first-degree murder in the slaying of Delbert Belton after turning himself in on Thursday night, Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub said in a written statement.

Straub said police have "probable cause" to arrest the second suspect, Kenan Adams-Kinard, 16, who remains at large.

"We would encourage Mr. Adams-Kinard to surrender immediately," Straub said.

Belton was a U.S. Army veteran who was wounded in the Battle of Okinawa as Allied forces began their invasion of Japan's home islands in 1945.

The longtime Spokane resident was meeting a friend at the Fraternal Order of Eagles Lodge on Spokane's north side Wednesday night, Spokane Police Sergeant Lydia Taylor said.

The friend discovered Belton inside his car with "traumatic" injuries to his face and head, she said.

Taylor said Belton was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries early on Thursday morning.

Still photographs from the lodge's security cameras that captured two young males running from the scene were released to the public, which led police to identify the two teens as suspects.

In the city where baseball legends Satchel Paige and Willie Mays played on a segregated team, plans for a new Negro League Baseball Museum were unveiled Friday.

Several former players for the famous "Birmingham Black Barons" turned out for the occasion anxious to honor their old teams and teammates.

The interactive museum will feature holograms that allow visitors to stand in the line of fire as Paige pitches one of his legendary fastballs.

Visitors will also be able to meet former players volunteering at the museum who will be free to "tell all the lies they want," joked Layton Revel, founder of the Center for Negro League Baseball Research (CNLBR) in Dallas.

"It will be a museum like no other one in the country," said Revel, who will be donating most of the memorabilia that will fill the 5,000 square foot museum, including 1,500 baseballs.

His massive collection was once displayed in a now-closed museum in Dallas and could cover 30,000 square feet, he said.

Negro League teams were professional baseball teams made up of African-American players excluded from the all-white major leagues during segregation.

They began informally in the late 1800s and operated professionally from 1920 to 1960, drawing large crowds around the country. Some of Major League Baseball's most talented players emerged from these leagues, including Jackie Robinson, the first black player in the modern era to be signed by a major league team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, in 1945.

The new museum plans to work in unison with the Kansas City, Missouri-based Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, which was founded in 1990, Birmingham Mayor William Bell announced at a press conference.

"We look forward to cooperating in spreading the word of the history of the Negro leagues and its relevancy," concurred Bob Kendrick, president of the Missouri museum. "Birmingham has a rich black baseball history and great players whose careers began there."

The Birmingham museum will focus on the segregated Southern League and the Industrial League as well as the integration of baseball, to complement Birmingham's civil rights past.

"I played for the Raleigh Tigers for one year, before the St. Louis Cardinals signed me in 1963. I was one of the first black players after integration, and I was only 17 years old," said Ernest "Big Dog" Fann, now 70 years old, who's story will be featured in the new facility.

The Birmingham City Council in May approved $400,000 in funds for the $2 million construction project adjoining Birmingham's new downtown baseball field.

The rest of the funding will be raised privately, according to Chuck Faush, Jr. a spokesman for the mayor.

Construction is slated to start in October for a December 2014 opening.

largest city.

A visibly emotional Filner addressed the San Diego City Council after members emerged from a closed meeting where they voted 7-0 to accept a settlement that requires him to step down, effective August 30, in exchange for the city joining in his legal defense in the lawsuit.

Filner, a 70-year-old Democratic former congressman elected San Diego mayor last year, had faced mounting pressure to step down after acknowledging behavior toward women that he said was unsuitable.

While Filner pledged to resign, his speech to a room full of reporters, accompanied by occasional cheers from supporters, was also defiant at times as he described being forced out of office.

"Certainly it was never my intention to be a mayor who went out like this," Filner said, before making an apparent reference to his 1960s work with civil rights group the Freedom Riders.

"You know I started my political career facing lynch mobs, and I think we have just faced one here in San Diego," he said. "In a lynch mob mentality, rumors become allegations, allegations become facts, facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall."

Filner's former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, sued him in July, accusing him of sexually harassing her. Since then 17 more women have come forward to say he groped them or made other unwanted advances.

Jackson's lawsuit is at the center of the settlement between Filner and the city, which sued him last month seeking to hold him responsible for any damages arising from the lawsuit.

As part of the deal, the city will join in his legal defense, according to an outline of the arrangement from the City Attorney's office which will be responsible for representing the mayor.

The city could also underwrite up to $98,000 in attorney fees for Filner's private legal defense, the document said, and while the city would pay for some forms of damages that may arise, it would not cover punitive damages.

'NO INTENTION TO BE OFFENSIVE'

During his speech, Filner, the first Democrat elected mayor of San Diego in two decades, also acknowledged that he had offended women.

"I had no intention to be offensive, to violate your personal or emotional space," he said.

High-profile attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Jackson, welcomed Filner's pending resignation.

In a statement, Allred noted that Filner in his speech had taken credit for protecting seals on San Diego beaches. "Unfortunately, he failed to give as much protection to the women who came into contact with him as he gave to the seals," she said.

Jackson, in her own written statement, said Filner "will not be missed."

Jessica Levinson, an associate clinical professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said Filner's only bargaining chip in discussions with the city had been his threat to remain in office.

"It sounds like it's an actual compromise, both sides get something," she said. "Ultimately what San Diego needs is for Filner to step down and for them to have a functioning mayor who's allowed in City Hall, and that the city doesn't fear that if he's allowed around women something bad is going to happen."

Under the city charter, City Council President Todd Gloria will assume the role of mayor until a special election is held within 90 days of the effective date of Filner's resignation.

If no single candidate in the special election wins a simple majority, then a runoff election would be held between the top two vote-getters within 49 more days.

The scandal will not hurt the chances of future Democratic candidates, said Steven Erie, a political science professor at the University of California at San Diego.

"I don't think it's damaged the Democratic brand for the simple reason that almost every major Democratic politician demanded Filner resign within about a week or so" of the scandal erupting, Erie said.



headline: Guantanamo war crimes tribunal in 'hot mess' over computer problems
byline: By Jane Sutton
8:31am EDT

Defense lawyers asked the judge in the Guantanamo war crimes tribunal on Friday to halt pretrial hearings in the 9/11 case until technicians fix a slew of computer and email problems that they said had made it nearly impossible to do their work.

"We're basically put back in the 19th century," said Army Major Jason Wright, who represents the alleged mastermind of the hijack plane attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed. "It takes about five to 10 times what it would normally take to do defense functions."

Pentagon technical advisers have said it would take up to 111 days to fix the problems once a contract was signed and money allocated, and that it was unlikely the work could be finished before the start of 2014.

The judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, said he would consider the matter further at a pretrial hearing scheduled to start on September 16 and decide then whether to cancel hearings set for October, November, December and January.

"I understand the serious nature of being able to communicate as a defense counsel," the judge said.

Defense lawyers said emails they sent were not received, investigative files that took years to compile had vanished and outside monitors were able to access their internet searches. Prosecutors and defense lawyers had temporarily been given access to each other's files, they said.

Some of the problems were disclosed earlier in the year. By April they had grown so severe that the chief defense counsel, Air Force Colonel Karen Mayberry, ordered defense lawyers to stop using their Pentagon computers for any confidential casework.

That means that to share draft documents with legal team members in other cities, they load them onto external drives, go to Starbucks and file them via Wi-Fi using their personal computers and personal email accounts, Wright said.

He said the chief of staff for the Pentagon official overseeing the tribunals issued her diagnosis in a conference call on Thursday, declaring: "This is a hot mess."

Clay Trivett, one of the prosecutors, questioned the severity of the problems, noting that the defense lawyers had produced PowerPoint presentations and extensive briefs for 29 legal motions argued at a week-long hearing that ended on Friday.

The problems stem from two main sources, the lawyers said.

Some began when technicians tried to create a mirrored system so work they did in Washington and work they did at the remote Guantanamo naval base were synchronized in both systems. Other issues began with a switch in email servers.

Defense attorney James Harrington, who represents Yemeni prisoner Ramzi bin al Shibh, said he had essentially been reduced to drafting motions with pen and paper.

Another of Mohammed's lawyers, David Nevin, called the problems especially worrisome in a death penalty case that prosecutors have routinely described as the most complex in U.S. history.

"In this day and age you cannot practice law this way," Nevin said.

The five defendants are accused of training and funding the hijackers who rammed four commercial jets into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania in 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people. They face charges that include conspiring with al Qaeda, terrorism and murder.

All five skipped court on Friday, the Muslim holy day.

Nine people whose relatives died in the attacks traveled to the base to watch the hearings. They said they had already waited 12 years for a verdict but would be patient if the computer problems caused more delays.

"We want something that stands on appeal," said Stephan Gerhardt, a Canadian citizen whose brother, Ralph, was a Cantor Fitzgerald vice president killed in the World Trade Center. "If it's going to take longer than we'd like it to take, that's fine. We're going to be here 'til the end."



headline: Florida imam gets 25 years in prison for aiding Pakistani Taliban
byline: By Zachary Fagenson
8:31am EDT

old south Florida imam was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a judge on Friday for funneling more than $50,000 to the Pakistani Taliban.

Hafiz Kahn was convicted in March on four counts of providing money and support to the group, which the United States considers a terrorist organization. He had faced a maximum of 60 years in prison, and prosecutors sought a 15-year sentence.

"The seriousness of what he did and the potential harm it could have caused is something this court takes seriously," U.S. District Judge Robert Scola said.

A U.S. citizen born in Pakistan, Khan was the imam at the Flagler Mosque, one of Miami's oldest mosques. He was arrested in 2011 along with two of his sons.

Prosecutors said Khan sent money to family and friends in Pakistan between 2008 and 2010 that was funneled to the Taliban, which they say used some of the funds to buy weapons.

"Mr. Khan took a list of his contacts and his desire to have sharia law in Pakistan and brought his mosque into this effort," said prosecutor John Carlton Shipley Jr. "He brought his family into this effort."

Evidence against the elder Khan included bank records and wiretapped phone calls in which he solicited money and expressed support for Pakistani Taliban efforts to overthrow the Pakistani government and attack Americans.

Khan said the money was intended to help support relatives, war victims and a school he had founded in his hometown in the Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan.

"Whatever money I sent was for the Islamic faith and to help poor people," Khan said through a translator. "I was never sympathetic to terrorists."

Prosecutors dropped charges against one of Khan's sons last year, citing a lack of evidence. A judge acquitted the other son for the same reason after prosecutors finished presenting their case in court in January.

Khan testified in court that he lied about supporting the Taliban because he wanted a $1 million donation from a purported Taliban sympathizer, a man who was actually an FBI informant.

The Pakistani Taliban was formed by Islamic militants in 2007. The U.S. State Department declared it a foreign terrorist organization three years later.

The group has been connected to a December 2009 suicide bomb attack on a U.S. military base in Khost, Afghanistan, that killed seven people. In 2011 the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for suicide bombings that killed more than 80 people in northwestern Pakistan.



headline: Fast-moving California wildfire rages into Yosemite National Park
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

A California wildfire swept further into Yosemite National Park on Friday, remaining largely unchecked as it threatened one of the country's major tourist destinations.

The so-called Rim Fire, which started on Saturday in the Stanislaus National Forest, had blackened 11,000 acres at the northeastern corner of Yosemite as of Friday afternoon after exploding in size overnight, park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said.

The blaze burning in the western Sierra Nevada mountains is now the fastest-moving of 50 large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West that have strained resources and prompted fire managers to open talks with Pentagon commanders and Canadian officials about possible reinforcements.

So far, the flames edging into scenic Yosemite have reached as far as Lake Eleanor, a remote area of the park which is normally accessible for fishing and hiking but was closed earlier this week along with several other areas after the fire broke out.

The park has been posting updates and alerts on its website on areas of access and closures. <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>)

The blaze, which has now charred a total of 165 square miles of forest land, mostly outside of Yosemite, was about 4 miles west of Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and some 20 miles from Yosemite Valley, the park's main tourist center, Cobb said.

"We're not anywhere near closing the (entire) park," she said. "We have to wait and see what the fire activity is and what it does, and we're just going to try as hard as we can to help with the suppression of the fire."

The Rim Fire, named for a Stanislaus National Forest lookout point called Rim of the World, has so far destroyed four homes and 12 outbuildings and was only 2 percent contained as of Friday.

"Firefighters are still going to have a stressful situation out there," fire information officer Ashley Taylor said of the fire burning in steep, rugged terrain. "We are just expecting a very active fire."

California Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Tuolumne County. A firefighter suffered heat-related illness while battling the flames on Thursday.

YOSEMITE ENTRANCE CLOSED

Highway 120, one of four access routes to a park known for its waterfalls, giant sequoia groves and other scenic wonders, was temporarily closed. The highway leads to the west side of the 750,000-acre park.

Located 195 miles from San Francisco and 315 miles from Los Angeles, Yosemite attracted nearly 4 million visitors last year.

The park was also threatening 4,500 homes near the burn zone, up from 2,500 on Thursday, and an undisclosed number of homes were ordered evacuated on Friday, adding to earlier evacuations.

In Idaho, meanwhile, crews increasingly had the upper hand over a massive blaze near the ski resort town of Sun Valley, as a storm system predicted to bring lightning and high winds brought rain instead.

The so-called Beaver Creek fire, now 67 percent contained, at its peak forced out occupants of 2,250 houses in upscale neighborhoods outside Sun Valley and destroyed one home and seven other buildings in a resort area in central Idaho where land and properties are valued at up to $8 billion.

The fire, sparked by lightning on August 7, has charred 111,000 acres of sagebrush, grasslands and pine forests in the Sawtooth Mountains at the height of a summer tourist season that draws thousands.

With the bulk of mandatory evacuation orders lifted, residents wearied by weeks of smoke and fire expressed new optimism. Linda and Ray Johnson, who were forced from their home near Ketchum last Friday and evacuated a second time in the pre-dawn hours on Saturday, returned to a home untouched by flames.

"I think the man upstairs was pulling a lot of strings," Linda Johnson said. "We're all just surviving with as much grace as we can and being as grateful as we can."

The 2013 fire season has already drained U.S. Forest Service fire suppression and emergency funds, causing the agency to redirect $600 million meant for other projects like campground and trail maintenance and thinning of trees to reduce wildfire risks, said agency spokesman Mike Ferris.

The service has spent some $967 million to protect lives and properties amid a season that has seen fires in Idaho, Utah, Colorado and California threaten homes and communities that border forest and wild lands where fire is more dangerous and costly to fight, Ferris said.

With hotshots and other elite fire crews stretched thin, U.S. fire managers will decide in coming days whether to seek U.S. military or international aid to check the roughly 50 large fires burning in the West.

depressants.

Outraged at police who cited Florida's "Stand Your Ground" self-defense law as a reason not to arrest neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, Agnew felt compelled to make a stand of his own.

The 28-year-old from Miami led the longest sit-in in memory at the Florida Capitol this summer. On Wednesday he will step up to the microphone in Washington to add his voice to those of President Barack Obama, former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and others commemorating the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech.

Now a salaried field organizer for the Service Employees International Union, Agnew represents a generation of civil rights activism half a century removed from King's iconic address.

Martin's killing prompted Agnew and many others to question whether equal justice in the United States was still only a dream.

The group he helped start, which calls itself the Dream Defenders, camped for 31 days in the office of Governor Rick Scott to protest Zimmerman's acquittal in July.

"We think the political landscape of America is turning very much in favor of young people now," Agnew told Reuters. "We want people to come together and talk about the future of Florida."

Many people blamed Zimmerman's acquittal on the Stand Your Ground law, under which people in fear of their lives no longer must try to retreat before defending themselves with potentially lethal force.

As the protest progressed, the Dream Defenders broadened their platform to include other issues, including educational opportunity and drug incarceration rates.

The Dream Defenders' protest surpassed by two weeks the 2011 pro-union sit-in at the Wisconsin Capitol, which was cut off by court order.

The group, which has established chapters on six of Florida's major public college campuses, is positioning itself to play a role in the 2014 midterm elections in a state that will be pivotal in the presidential campaigns that launch soon after.

"They planted the seeds for issues and mobilization efforts that clearly are going to be evident in the 2014 election cycle," said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida.

Agnew met fellow Dream Defenders founders Gabriel Pendas and Ahmad Abuznaid a decade ago, when he was a student at Florida A&M; University in the state capital, Tallahassee.

They got a taste of activism in 2006 while participating in marches and a two-day student-led sit-in at then-Governor Jeb Bush's office over the death of another black teen, Martin Lee Anderson, at a juvenile boot camp.

The Florida legislature subsequently closed all five state camps.

FROM SALES TO ACTIVISM

As a child of poverty, Agnew said he felt obligated upon graduation to use his business degree to secure a spot for himself in the middle class, and he took a sales job with pharmaceuticals company Eli Lilly &amp; Co.

But his experience in the Anderson case kept tugging at his conscience.

So within weeks of Martin's killing, Agnew said he gave up his $52,000 salary ($63,000 with bonuses), rented out his house and reconnected with Pendas, who was working as a union organizer in Miami, and Abuznaid who was vacationing in Amsterdam after passing the Florida bar.

Agnew draws a connection between the Dream Defenders and the anti-war and civil rights movements of two generations ago, especially after some of the 1960s leaders such as Jesse Jackson and Julian Bond joined them briefly in the Florida Capitol.

Bond agreed. "I think it's fair to say that, in many, many ways, what happened here over the last several days is very much like what happened across the South in the days when I was a young guy," he told Reuters as the Dream Defenders were decamping on August 15.

Despite ending the sit-in, Agnew said the Dream Defenders had accomplished some of their goals, including getting the speaker of Florida's House of Representatives to call for a committee hearing next month on the Stand Your Ground law.

He said it was fitting that the 50th anniversary of King's speech was only a few days away.

"There are many comparisons to be made between today and yesterday," he said. "This is the same struggle, the same fight, the same eagerness to do something about it. And we're lucky to have these spirited young people involved in it."

reaching law.

Restaurants want to increase the number of hours that define a full-time worker. Unionized electrical workers are seeking to change the treatment of health plans offered by multiple employers. Medical device companies hope to end a tax against them even though they are already paying that tax.

Lobbyists face slim odds of getting any additional changes to the law before October 1, when millions of Americans will be able to sign up for subsidized health insurance through online exchanges in each state.

But there is an urgency to push for changes now, legislative experts say, because it will become much harder to do so once the law takes full effect in January. Lobbying may also give these groups leverage in negotiations down the road.

"You can continue advocating for a change, and then you can trade those chips later on for something else," said Dan Mendelson, a former Clinton Administration health official who is chief executive of advisory company Avalere Health. "The fact that everybody knows they're unlikely to get anything will not stop advocacy."

A Reuters review of lobbying records found that more than 500 companies, business groups, consumer advocates, unions and other organizations weighed in on the Affordable Care Act during the second quarter of this year.

A typical issue in Washington attracts 15 interest groups at any one time, according to research by Beth Leech, a Rutgers University political science professor who has written three books about lobbying. At the height of political debate over the law, just before Congress passed the legislation in March 2010, more than 1,000 stakeholders lobbied on the bill.

"The Affordable Care Act, from beginning to end, has had an extraordinary amount of lobbying," said Leech. "All these rules are being made for the first time, so there's a great urgency to have that first rule be a rule you like."

The National Health Council, which represents patients diagnosed with chronic diseases, is fighting a government decision to delay until 2015 a limit on out-of-pocket costs for some consumers. According to the February ruling, Americans who end up being covered by two different companies for medical and pharmacy costs will have to meet maximum spending limits for both, potentially doubling their costs.

To push the issue, the health council drafted a letter signed by more than 100 patient groups objecting to the government's plan. Advocates then argued their case on a July conference call with representatives from three federal agencies - Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services. The government responded by saying the policy would stand.

"We understand that implementation of something this new, this big is going to be difficult," said Marc Boutin, NHC executive vice president, who wants to alleviate the out-of-pocket burden by January 1. "But we should not be creating additional barriers to access."

CHANGES IN THE SERVICE OF SMOOTHER ENROLLMENT

Others hope the Obama administration will show greater flexibility toward last-minute changes that would help the government sign up millions of uninsured Americans in the law's first year.

"We're in a homestretch just to get to October 1 at this point," said Krista Drobac, a policy adviser with law firm DLA Piper's healthcare policy and regulatory group. "The changes that you're going to see between now and then increase the chances of a smooth open-enrollment period."

She cited an agreement announced late last month between the U.S. government and eHealth Inc allowing the online insurance broker to enroll individuals eligible for tax subsidies in more than 30 states.

Some may have a tougher hill to climb. After more than three years of trying to solicit changes through the administration, the National Restaurant Association has turned to Congress to alter the law's definition of a full-time worker to one who works 40 hours a week, up from 30.

Starting in 2015, employers with more than 50 full-time staff are required to provide health coverage or face a penalty.

Waiters, kitchen staff and other restaurant employees work variable shifts that are difficult to track, while many restaurants are already monitoring the 40-hour threshold that triggers overtime payments, said Michelle Neblett, the NRA's director of labor and workforce policy. The 30-hour threshold would hurt the ability of employees to work flexible hours, she said, as managers will grow skittish about costs.

Groups may win success by finding ways to avoid the healthcare law's political quagmire altogether.

For instance, the medical device and health insurance industries may seek relief from new taxes imposed by Obamacare by lobbying on tax-reform proposals, arguing that the levies they face have been decoupled from Obamacare. "It's strictly an issue of corporate taxation," said J.C. Scott, chief lobbyist for the Advanced Medical Technology Association.

Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, said her center has written more than 100 pages of comments this year to influence new regulations. She recognizes that the administration has likely closed the door on tweaking rules.

"States really have to turn their attention to getting this up and running," Alker said.



headline: U.S. soldier who killed Afghan villagers gets life without parole
byline: By Eric M. Johnson
8:31am EDT

A decorated American soldier was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on Friday for killing 16 unarmed Afghan civilians, mostly women and children, in two bloody nighttime forays from his military post.

Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, a veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, has admitted to slaughtering the villagers in attacks on their family compounds in Kandahar province in March 2012.

He pleaded guilty to the killings in June in a deal that spared him the death penalty, and a sentencing jury of six military personnel deliberated less than two hours on Friday before deciding he should spend the rest of his life in prison.

Bales, who appeared in a military court in Washington state in blue military dress, showed no emotion as the verdict was handed down, but his mother cried and rocked back and forth.

Army prosecutors said Bales acted alone and with premeditation when, armed with a pistol, a rifle and a grenade launcher, he left his outpost twice during the night, returning in the middle of his rampage to tell a fellow soldier, "I just shot up some people."

The killings marked the worst case of civilian deaths blamed on a rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in Afghanistan.

"He wiped out generations and he ruined lives forever," prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Jay Morse told the jury in his closing arguments. "He should be known by one official title from this day until the day he dies: inmate."

In arguing for life without parole, Morse told jurors that Bales lacked a moral compass, and played video in which Bales could be seen returning to base on the day of the killings, cloaked in a blanket snatched during the rampage.

"This is the walk of a cold blooded killer," Morse said.

Defense attorneys had contended that Bales carried out the killings after suffering a breakdown under the pressure of the last of his four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. They said he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before shipping off to Kandahar province.

"We won the case when we got the death penalty off the table," John Henry Browne, one of Bales' attorneys, said in a statement after the sentence was handed down, adding the defense would mount an automatic appeal.

'WE DIDN'T GET OUR WISH'

Some Afghan survivors of the attack and family members of the victims who had been flown to the United States to testify about the impact of the shooting later expressed disappointment at a news conference that the penalty was not stronger.

"This murderer jumped into my house in the middle of the night, killed 11 members of my family and then burned them," said villager Hajji Mohammad Wazir, who lost his wife and six of his seven children, among other relatives, in the attacks.

"We were brought all the way here from Afghanistan to see if justice would be served. But not our way. The justice was served (in the) American way, their way," he said. "We wanted this murderer to be executed but we didn't get our wish."

Bales' sentencing came the same day a separate military jury convicted U.S. Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan of killing 13 people in 2009 when he walked into a medical facility at Fort Hood, Texas, and opened fire on unarmed soldiers with a laser-sighted handgun. He could face the death penalty.

Prior to the sentencing, Bales told the jury on Thursday he had struggled with anger issues that worsened after his third military deployment, but that he had tried to disguise his problems behind a veneer of normalcy. He said he briefly sought treatment before his final deployment but stopped after he felt it was not working.

He also apologized, both to his fellow servicemen and to the Afghan villagers, for the killings, saying: "What I did is an act of cowardice behind a mask of fear, bullshit and bravado."

In seeking the possibility of parole for Bales, civilian defense attorney Emma Scanlan had tried to persuade the jury to look at Bales' life in entirety while deciding on an appropriate sentence.

"We don't throw out the first 38 years," Scanlan said. "That doesn't mean, again, that there is anything about this that is not completely horrific."

Scanlan read a letter Bales wrote to his children and family before the attack in which he compared Afghan children to his own, saying they love "to eat candy and play soccer."

"Those aren't the words of a cold-blooded murderer who likes to kill innocent women and children," Scanlan said.



headline: Possible closure of Ohio clinic shows new tactic in U.S. abortion clash
byline: By George Tanber
8:31am EDT

duty police patrol the parking lot.

A sign in a neighbor's window reads: "You Shall Not Murder."

Toledo's Capital Care abortion clinic, the only one in this rust belt city of 285,000, has become the latest front in the national battle over abortion rights, this one centering on a new state law that bars agreements to move women needing emergency care to public hospitals.

Toledo's clinic may have to close because its transfer agreement with a public hospital expired last month and under the new law it cannot renew it.

Abortion clinics in Ohio are required to have so-called transfer agreements with hospitals under which a patient can be admitted in case of complications. In 2011, the latest year for which data is available from the health department, complications arose in 91 of 24,764 abortions performed in Ohio.

The new law passed by Ohio's Republican-dominated legislature in June blocks public hospitals from entering into transfer agreements with abortion clinics. The result is that clinics either must have arrangements with private hospitals, since those with public hospitals are barred, or be forced to close since they would be operating without the required transfer agreement in place.

Eight other states require abortion clinics to have transfer agreements, including Nebraska and Wisconsin, and abortion rights groups fear Ohio's crack down could be replicated elsewhere.

"This is a brand new idea," said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. "It wouldn't be surprising if next year we saw this restriction appear in other states."

A renewed push by conservative Republicans to put fresh restrictions on abortion at the state level has resulted in a rash of new legislation over the past two years. New laws have ranged from limits on insurance coverage for abortions to requirements that women considering an abortion undergo an ultrasound test, during which technicians typically are required to point out a fetus' visible organs.

Some states have extended waiting periods for those who seek an abortion, while others have zeroed in on later term abortions.

Ohio's law marks yet another approach. Backers of the legislation say a transfer agreement with a public hospital amounts to indirect support for abortion, paid by many who disagree with it.

"We think it's going to protect taxpayers who oppose abortions," Ohio Right to Life President Michael Gonidakis said.

State Rep. Lynn Wachtmann, a Republican who chairs the House health committee, helped prepare the language for the transfer agreement law, which was included as a provision in the budget bill.

"The real issue with any agreement with a public hospital is the vast majority of the people in Ohio feel that no public funds or public entities should be supportive of the babykilling industry," said Wachtmann.

Opponents of the law say it will put women's health at risk, and decry it as a maneuver to undermine the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing the right to abortion. The court has left the states free to place various restrictions on abortion.

Nearly one in ten abortions performed in Ohio in 2011 was in Lucas County, which includes Toledo, according to the health department. A second abortion clinic in Toledo closed earlier this year.

Capital Care Network of Toledo's agreement with the University of Toledo Medical Center, a public hospital, to transfer patients in case of complications expired on July 31. It cannot renew that agreement under the new law.

Ohio's health director, Theodore Wymyslo, told Capital Care he is proposing revoking the facility's license, and that it has 30 days to request a hearing. His letter was received August 6, and the clinic had not yet requested a hearing as of Friday, according to the department.

"We are seeking a way to stay open," said Dr. Thomas Michaelis, who works at the clinic. "We have lawyers who are working on this out of our main office in Columbus."

Michaelis said if the clinic closes, women in the area will have to travel to Detroit, Cleveland or Columbus for abortions.

Terrie Hubbard, identified by the health department as the owner of Capital Care Network in Columbus, did not respond to requests for comment.

It was not clear if the new Ohio law would affect the state's 11 other abortion clinics, since the measure only directly affects those with transfer agreements with public hospitals rather than private.

Ohio Right to Life's Gonidakis said he does not know of any other abortion clinic tied to one of the state's 18 public hospitals. The health department said it was still reviewing the measure and its impact on the state's clinics.

Abortion rights groups, however, say the impact of the Ohio law could be felt beyond the Capital Care clinic.

"It's just a very shrewd way to close abortion clinics," said Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio. "This isn't about patient safety - this is about putting barriers between women and a safe, legal medical procedure."

A woman waiting at a bus-stop with her infant son near the Capital Care clinic said she had considered making an appointment there when she found out she was pregnant again two months ago. But then she heard the clinic was closing.

"I'm not happy," said the 21-year-old woman, who gave her name only as "Faye." "They made the decision for me."

Defense lawyers asked the judge in the Guantanamo war crimes tribunal on Friday to halt pretrial hearings in the 9/11 case until technicians fix a slew of computer and email problems that they said had made it nearly impossible to do their work.

"We're basically put back in the 19th century," said Army Major Jason Wright, who represents the alleged mastermind of the hijack plane attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed. "It takes about five to 10 times what it would normally take to do defense functions."

Pentagon technical advisers have said it would take up to 111 days to fix the problems once a contract was signed and money allocated, and that it was unlikely the work could be done before the start of 2014.

The judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, said he would consider the matter further at a pretrial hearing scheduled to start on September 16 and decide then whether to cancel hearings set for October, November, December and January.

"I understand the serious nature of being able to communicate as a defense counsel," the judge said.

Defense lawyers said emails they sent were not received, investigative files that took years to compile had vanished and outside monitors were able to access their internet searches. Prosecutors and defense lawyers had temporarily been given access to each other's files, they said.

Some of the problems were disclosed earlier in the year. By April they had grown so severe that the chief defense counsel, Air Force Colonel Karen Mayberry, ordered defense lawyers to stop using their Pentagon computers for any confidential casework.

That means that in order to share draft documents with legal team members in other cities, they regularly go to Starbucks and file them via Wi-Fi using their personal computers and personal email accounts, Wright said.

He said the chief of staff for the Pentagon official overseeing the tribunals issued her diagnosis in a conference call on Thursday, declaring: "This is a hot mess."

Clay Trivett, one of the prosecutors, questioned the severity of the problems, noting that the defense lawyers had produced PowerPoint presentations and extensive legal briefs for 29 legal motions argued at a week-long hearing that ended on Friday.

The problems stem from two main sources, the lawyers said.

Some began when technicians tried to create a mirrored system so work they did in Washington and work they did at the remote Guantanamo naval base were synchronized in both systems. Other issues began with a switch in email systems.

Defense attorney James Harrington, who represents Yemeni prisoner Ramzi bin al Shibh, said he had essentially been reduced to drafting motions with pen and paper.

Another of Mohammed's lawyers, David Nevin, called the problems especially worrisome in a death penalty case that prosecutors have routinely described as the most complex in U.S. history.

"In this day and age you cannot practice law this way," Nevin said.

The five defendants are accused of training and funding the hijackers who rammed four commercial jets into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania in 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people. They face charges that include conspiring with al Qaeda, terrorism and murder.

All five skipped court on Friday.

criminals.

And soon it expects at have at least three more.

Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan, who was found guilty on Friday of killing 13, mostly soldiers, in a rampage at a military base in Fort Hood Texas, could become the sixth man on death row at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Army staff sergeant Robert Bales, who was sentenced Friday to life in prison without parole for killing 16 Afghan civilians in a nighttime massacre last year, is also to serve out his sentence in Leavenworth, a semi-rural community in northeast Kansas.

U.S. soldier Bradley Manning, who was sentenced on Wednesday to 35 years in prison for turning over classified files to WikiLeaks, is also set to serve his sentence in Leavenworth.

It is the only maximum security - or "Level 3" - prison operated by the Department of Defense, handling military men who draw lengthy sentences for crimes deemed among the worst of the worst.

For decades the prisoners who were sent to Fort Leavenworth were locked away in an imposing fortress nicknamed the "Castle," which rose high from the bluffs along the Missouri River and had a reputation for grim surroundings and a strict adherence to discipline for the more than 1,000 prisoners it held.

The barracks of the original facility were torn down in 2004, but ghosts of executed prisoners continue to haunt some of the still-standing facilities, locals say.

The $68 million dollar, modern-day facility, known simply as the USDB, opened in 2002 and now houses about 450 prisoners. There are no bars, cells have solid doors and a window, and prisoners are spread through three triangular shaped housing units.

Five inmates at USDB are on death row, all convicted of premeditated murder or felony murder. There is no death chamber at the USDB and the last military execution dates back to 1961 and it is not clear when or if another will take place. Unlike state executions, members of the military cannot be executed unless the U.S. President personally confirms the death sentence.

If he receives the death penalty, the 42-year-old Hasan would live in an isolated corridor away from other inmates. Hasan was found guilty Friday of premeditated murder for killing 13 and attempting to murder 32 people in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas in November 2009. The convictions mean Hasan could face lethal injection. The penalty phase of Hasan's court-martial begins on Monday and the jury will make a recommendation to the judge, who will determine the sentence.

Prison officials will not speak about Manning or Hasan specifically - they refuse to discuss individual inmates. But spokeswoman Kimberly Lewis said no one gets special treatment at the USDB.

That means requests for special attire or hormone therapy, such as Manning's lawyer has said his 25-year-old client will seek to transition his gender from man to woman, will be hard to come by.

"According to Army regulations soldiers can not receive hormone therapy or reassignment surgery," said Lewis.

The prison does offer individual and group therapy, as well as vocational training. Inmates can learn woodworking, sheet metal and welding skills, barbering and study how to be a dental assistant. Inmates also have the use of an indoor gym and weight room, a music room, library and an arts and crafts studio as well an outdoor baseball field, running track and basketball court.

Currently on death row at Fort Leavenworth are Army private Ronald Gray, who was convicted of multiple murders and rapes in crime spree in 1986 and 1987; former Army sergeant Hasan Akbar, convicted of murdering two people and attempting to murder 16 soldiers in an attack on a camp in Kuwait; Dwight Loving, an Army private who robbed and killed two cab drivers, shooting them each in the head; Andrew Witt, of the U.S. Air Force, who was convicted of stabbing a husband and wife to death in their home; and Timothy Hennis, also of the Army, who was convicted of killing a North Carolina mother and her two children.

sighted handgun.

It was the deadliest mass murder ever at a U.S. military base.

The convictions mean Hasan could face the death penalty by lethal injection, possibly making him the first soldier to be executed by the U.S. military since 1961.

Hasan, dressed in combat fatigues and seated in a wheelchair after being paralyzed from the waist down when shot by police to end the rampage, stared directly at the jury while the panel's president read the verdict. Afterward he looked down, stroking his beard.

The jury of 13 combat veterans - nine colonels, three lieutenant colonels, and one major - deliberated about three hours on Thursday afternoon and another three hours on Friday morning. They will determine Hasan's sentence after hearing the penalty phase of the court-martial starting on Monday.

Hasan, 42, told mental health evaluators he wanted to become a martyr and lawyers assisting him said he was actively seeking the death penalty. Hasan disputed that claim without outright denying it, then sat passively as prosecutors presented overwhelming evidence against him.

Hasan, an American-born Muslim who acted as his own defense lawyer, admitted in his opening statement to killing 13 people and wounding 31, saying he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war on Islam. He was also charged with attempted premeditated murder on a 32nd person he shot at and missed.

Twelve of the dead were active duty soldiers and one was retired. Of the wounded, 30 were soldiers and one a police officer.

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges, and the conviction renewed calls by advocates who are seeking combat benefits for the victims similar to those paid to victims of the attacks of September 11, 2001.

Two attorneys representing some of the victims criticized the Department of Defense for classifying the attack as "workplace violence," and Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson vowed to fight for state veterans' benefits such as access to below-market interest rates for loans to buy land.

"MY BABY, MY BABY"

In their closing statement, prosecutors stressed that Hasan's rampage on November 5, 2009, was premeditated, noting that he wore a uniform even though he was on leave and stuffed his pockets with paper towels to prevent some 20 magazines of ammunition from jingling.

Prosecutors called 89 witnesses in two weeks of testimony, with many describing in horrific detail the bloodbath in and around a medical building at Fort Hood.

Private Francheska Velez, who was pregnant, screamed "my baby, my baby" before being shot dead. Others were gunned down while trying stop Hasan, and survivors reported seeing the red laser of his weapon flashing across their eyes. Investigators recovered 146 shell casings from the scene.

Amid speculation about the emotional toll on victims who may have had to face cross-examination from him, Hasan spared them from questioning.

For Hasan to be eligible for the death penalty, the jury needed to find he killed at least two people, and at least one of those had to be a unanimous premeditated murder conviction.

The jury must also be unanimous in order to impose the death penalty, which would trigger a lengthy process requiring the approval of the Fort Hood commanding general, and later the president of the United States, in order for there to be an execution.

The shootings came at a time of heightened tensions over the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which strained relations between the United States and countries with predominantly Muslim populations.

Hasan opened fire at an area where soldiers were being evaluated before being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan or after returning home, yelling "Allahu akbar" ("God is greatest" in Arabic), according to several witnesses.

Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing, praised Hasan as a hero and "a man of conscience." U.S. intelligence officials say Hasan had sent emails to Awlaki, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011. The judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, blocked those emails from being submitted as evidence in the trial.

Hasan told the judge at one point during the trial his attack was motivated by "an illegal war" and that he had "adequate provocation" to launch the attack on soldiers readying to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Hasan's trial took place at the same time as two other high-profile courts-martial. Also on Friday, Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales was sentenced to life in prison for killing 16 Afghan civilians in 2012. On Wednesday, U.S. Army Private First Class Bradley Manning was sentenced to 35 years for providing secret files to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.

striking inmates protesting against the practice, a U.N. expert said on Friday.

Californian prisoners launched a hunger strike on July 8 to demand an end to the housing of inmates in near-isolation for years on end because they are believed to be associated with gangs.

Juan E. Méndez, the independent United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, said the U.S. government should abolish the use of prolonged solitary confinement under all circumstances.

"Even if solitary confinement is applied for short periods of time, it often causes mental and physical suffering or humiliation, amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and if the resulting pain or sufferings are severe, solitary confinement even amounts to torture," Méndez said in a statement.

Solitary confinement should only be used "in very exceptional circumstances, as a last resort, for as short a time as possible and with established safeguards in place" and under strict medical supervision.

About 80,000 U.S. prisoners are in solitary confinement, including nearly 12,000 in California, said the statement issued by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Méndez was particularly concerned about California's Pelican Bay maximum security prison, which has more than 400 prisoners who have been in isolation for over a decade, with an average time in solitary of 7.5 years.

California's jails won federal court permission this week to force-feed hunger-striking inmates, even if they have signed orders asking not to be resuscitated. A prison health spokeswoman said on Tuesday there was no imminent need to do so.

As of Monday, 136 inmates were taking part in the strike.

Méndez said it was "not acceptable to use threats of forced feeding or other types of physical or psychological coercion against individuals who have opted for the extreme recourse of a hunger strike".

In many cases the inmates are isolated for 22-23 hours per day in cells measuring 8 by 12 feet, with poor ventilation and no natural light, the statement said.

The comments by Méndez, a professor at the American University - Washington College of Law, are not binding on the United States, but his opinions could form the basis for debate at the United Nations.

The U.S. record is due to be scrutinized in October by the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance with a landmark treaty on civil and political rights.

Méndez is himself a former torture victim from Argentina.



headline: Philadelphia teachers protest pay cut demands
byline: By Hilary Russ
8:31am EDT

Hundreds of teachers in Philadelphia voiced their outrage on Thursday at proposed pay and benefit cuts as public school officials demanded $133 million in concessions from employees because of a financial crisis.

With the teachers' labor contract due to expire on August 31 and school set to start about a week after that, the district and union leaders are still far apart on terms, according to George Jackson, spokesman for the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers.

Teachers are being asked to take salary cuts of between 5 and 13 percent next year and to pay more for health coverage.

More than 200 teachers held a march and then rallied outside the school board offices on Thursday to protest the demands.

Teacher Darcel McClen expressed disappointment that she has had to spend $1,000 of her own money on classroom supplies and taught 30 kindergartners without a classroom aide last year.

McClen, who took a pay cut to switch careers and become a teacher nine years ago, makes about $56,000 a year and is facing a 13 percent pay cut.

"It's like we're not appreciated," she said. "It's an awful feeling."

Scott Knoflicek, a middle school science teacher protesting with his two young daughters in tow, said he goes dumpster diving for the bottles, cans, furniture and other supplies he needs to teach his lab classes.

Because of the budget crisis driven by a weak economy and falling enrollment in traditional schools, the school district had to shutter 30 schools over the past two years. In June, it laid off about 3,800 teachers, assistant principals, aides and other staffers to close a $304 million shortfall. Pension benefits are set at by the state and are not an issue in the local negotiations.

The long-brewing financial crisis for Philadelphia's school system reached a crescendo earlier this month when Superintendent William Hite threatened to delay the start of the school year because the district had so few remaining employees.

A last-minute $50 million loan from the city is expected to allow Hite to rehire about 1,000 employees and allow the schools to reopen on-time on September 9.

STUDENTS FLEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Urban school systems across the United States have been hammered by reductions in state aid since the 2007-09 recession. In many states, the level of aid still hasn't returned to pre-recession levels.

The rapid growth of charter schools has compounded the problem, as students flee traditional public school systems and take a share of state funds with them.

Philadelphia has hemorrhaged students. In 2008, just 16 percent of pupils were enrolled in charter schools. But for the 2013-2014 school year, about 62,000 - or more than a third - of Philadelphia's 198,000 students will attend one of about 80 charter schools, according to Moody's Investors Service.

When school starts, Philadelphia will have about 134,000 students in 212 public schools, according to Fernando Gallard, spokesman for the district.

"We are at the (negotiating) table every day," he said. "We hope it's a positive result." He declined to provide further details on the status of talks.

Jackson, the teachers' union spokesman, would not say whether members were prepared to strike if no agreement is reached.

"We're planning to continue negotiations and work toward a contract that's good for the our schools, our students, our members and the school district," he said.

In Chicago, teachers walked off the job for eight days at the start of the school year in 2012. It was the city's first teachers' strike in a quarter of a century, spurred on by Mayor Rahm Emanuel's drive for sweeping education reforms as their contract was about to run out.

Pennsylvania has played a role in overseeing Philadelphia's school district since 2001, when the state established a school reform commission (SRC) for the district. Three of its five members are appointed by the governor and two others by the mayor, with no elected members.

The city has a population of about 1.5 million, down from a peak of more than 2 million in the 1950s. Its median family income of about $37,000 is well below the state and national average.



headline: Bank of America reviews long-hours culture after intern's death

hours culture of the world's top banks.

Moritz Erhardt, a 21-year-old German student, was found dead late last week at his London accommodation after allegedly working for 72 hours without sleep during a summer internship with the U.S. bank's investment banking division.

The cause of his death remains unknown, and the bank has declined to comment on reports that he was epileptic. The results of blood tests are not due back for several weeks.

But Erhardt's death raised questions over who was responsible for the long hours worked by ambitious graduates who push themselves to the limit during summer internships to secure jobs in the highly competitive and well-paid finance industry.

A spokesman for Bank of America said it had convened a senior working group to "look at all aspects our working practices, with a particular focus on our junior populations".

He declined to comment on who would be involved in the group, how long the review would take, or possible outcomes.

"Our immediate priority is to do everything we can to continue to support the Erhardt family, our interns and impacted employees at this extremely difficult time," he said in a statement.

Former interns and junior employees say 20-hour days, weekends at work and meals in the office are par for the course in the glass towers of finance in London and New York.

Many talk of the "magic roundabout" where workers get a taxi home after dawn and leave it waiting while they have a quick shower and then return to work.

"SLAVERY IN THE CITY"

But Erhardt's death has spurred a debate about the grueling schedules that interns endure, with one British newspaper dubbing the lifestyle "slavery in the city".

Many interns, however, said they imposed these long hours on themselves as they were determined to use the summer to prove that they had what it takes to succeed.

Gordon Chesterman, director of the careers service at the University of Cambridge, one of the UK's top universities, said it was the responsibility of employers to change the system.

"My hope is that this has been a wake-up call and that employers will take a long, hard look at what they are doing with their interns ... How much longer can we carry on with this regime of long hours?" Chesterman said.

Employment lawyers said companies had legal obligations to ensure employees, including interns, were not exposed to health and safety risks and warned that failing to meet those obligations could leave them open to criminal prosecution and hefty fines.

"Allowing or turning a blind eye to an intern going beyond the call of duty to show they can best handle the pressure may breach those duties and statutory obligations if an intern is injured as a result," said Michael-John Andrews, expert employment lawyer from Barlow Robbins LLP.

A spokeswoman for Britain's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills declined to comment on working conditions for interns but said under European Union rules workers aged 18 and over could decide to work more than a standard 48-hour week.

Interns, however, were skeptical that banks could end the workaholic culture that consumes newcomers every summer.

"You'd have to have someone checking security passes to see how long they've been in the office, but even when they are at home they are glued to their Blackberry and feel like they're on call," said a former intern at Nomura.

parched American West.

Preliminary plans for military and international aid come as the U.S. Forest Service is feeling the pinch of federal budget cuts known as sequestration even as demand for firefighters and equipment such as air tankers is exceeding supply, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise.

Elite teams of firefighters known as hotshots and smoke jumpers, whose job it is to mount the initial attack on blazes in remote, rugged terrain, are stretched too thin, said Stephen Gage, assistant operations director for fire and aviation management for the Forest Service.

The agency's 100-plus hotshot crews are all either assigned to fires in the West or are taking required periods of rest and recovery, leaving no spare teams to dispatch to any additional fires where they might be needed, he said.

"We have just a limited number of those assets. We'd love to give everybody what they need when they ask for it," he said. "Deciding which area gets those highly skilled crews and which doesn't is the hardest thing we do."

Fire managers are poised to decide in coming days whether to "pull the trigger" on a pending request to the U.S. military for an initial deployment of 200 ground troops to supplement firefighting personnel, Gage said. It would take roughly a week to train and mobilize those troops, who would then be assigned to large fires in the West.

Thousands of firefighters were laboring on Thursday to suppress dozens of blazes raging in several Western states, from a monster fire menacing the area around the world-class ski resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, to a California blaze near Yosemite National Park that more than tripled in size overnight.

Meanwhile, weather forecasters have predicted heightened wildfire risks for northern California, the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Rockies posed by storm systems likely to bring lightning and strong winds.

FIRE INDEX RAISED

U.S. fire managers this week opened the way to potentially seeking military aid and gaining firefighting resources stemming from agreements with Canada, Australia and New Zealand by raising the national wildfire alert index to the maximum level of 5 for the first time in five years.

Gage said he could not recall any previous instance in recent years when the United States has requested large-scale Canadian assistance, such as fire crews and aircraft, in addition to the several air tankers already on loan from Canada.

"We've opened discussions with Canada about utilizing their assets if they are available," he said.

Federal fire officials have already shifted stores of equipment such as hand tools and supplies from Southern states like Kentucky to the West amid all-out air and ground offensives against flames that have charred hundreds of thousands of acres (tens of thousands of hectares) of parched sagebrush, grasslands and forests.

The 2013 fire season has already seen the most destructive fire in Colorado history, the deadliest blaze on record in Arizona and has forced the evacuation of many thousands across the region.

Years of drought have played a key role in the ignition and spread of blazes that fire managers say stand out for their intensity and speed, even as the overall acreage burned remains below the 10-year average.



headline: Planned Parenthood sues Indiana over abortion clinic requirements
byline: By Susan Guyett

called abortion pill to have full surgical facilities, which it says would halt abortion services at a clinic in the state.

Under the law, Planned Parenthood would have to upgrade its clinic in Lafayette, Indiana, to surgical standards or stop administering RU-486, commonly called the abortion pill, it said in a lawsuit filed in Indianapolis federal court.

Separately, the group that has been at the forefront of the U.S. national battle over abortion won a legal fight to block an Arizona law that would have cut off funding through the state for its health care clinics because they also performs abortions.

Imposing surgical facility requirements on clinics where no surgery is performed "is not only unreasonable, it is utterly irrational ...," Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky said in the lawsuit, which seeks a federal court injunction.

Legislators supporting the law that took effect July 1 have said it would protect women's health. It requires clinics providing non-surgical abortions to have separate procedure, recovery and scrub rooms like surgical centers starting January 1.

Planned Parenthood operates four of the 10 clinics that provide abortions in Indiana. Three Planned Parenthood clinics perform surgical abortions and administer the abortion pill at up to nine weeks of pregnancy. The Lafayette clinic offers only the abortion pill at up to nine weeks of pregnancy.

The Lafayette clinic provided 54 non-surgical abortions in the 12 months ended July 1, and other medication, primarily contraception, more than 10,000 times, the lawsuit said.

If the Lafayette clinic stops providing non-surgical abortions, the closest clinics are 60 miles away in Indianapolis or 85 miles in Merrillville, Planned Parenthood said, adding that the Lafayette clinic would continue to provide health services.

Planned Parenthood applied on July 15 with Indiana state health officials for a license and a waiver of the requirements.

The Indiana law exempts physician's offices from the requirements as long as surgical procedures performed there are not primarily surgical abortions and abortion-inducing drugs are not the primarily prescribed drugs.

The requirements violate a woman's constitutional right to privacy, equal protection and are "arbitrary and irrational" in violation of a woman's right to due process, the lawsuit said.

The two-pill abortion medication called RU-486 has been legally available in the United States since 2000. By 2008 it accounted for about a quarter of U.S. abortions performed before nine weeks of gestation, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports the right to abortion.

In the Arizona case, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco affirmed that the law robs individuals on Medicaid of the ability to choose healthcare services. The law would have stopped Medicaid funding for all procedures to any healthcare provider who performed abortions.

The bill targeting Planned Parenthood was signed into law in May 2012 by Republican Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, with the strong backing of socially conservative lawmakers. It came as part of nationwide moves by abortion opponents to defund groups like Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers.

Medicaid, a joint program between states and the federal government, provides healthcare coverage for low-income individuals.



headline: Beaten Ohio inmate dies in prison's third killing in a year
byline: By Kim Palmer
8:31am EDT

An Ohio prisoner who was beaten with baseball bats by his fellow inmates has died, becoming the third man killed in just the past year at an overcrowded state prison in northeastern Ohio, officials said on Thursday.

James Oglesby, 32, who was serving a life sentence for aggravated murder and kidnapping, died Wednesday at a Toledo hospital, said Ricky Seyfang, spokeswoman for the state corrections department. He was beaten Sunday in the recreation yard at Toledo Correctional Institution, Seyfang said.

"Three homicides in one facility is high," said Joanna Saul, executive director of the Correctional Institution Inspection Committee, a state legislative group that monitors prisons.

Ohio's entire prison system had one confirmed homicide in 2010, two in 2011 and three in 2012, Saul said. With Oglesby's death, the Toledo prison has had three homicides since September 2012, she said.

Saul said her group had just inspected the prison, which she said has been plagued by high employee turnover and gang violence in part due to overcrowding. Ohio's prison system has been operating at about 130 percent of capacity, she said.

The Toledo prison was built in 2000 to house 950 prisoners in individual cells. Inmates have been doubled up and more than 200 maximum security inmates added since 2010, raising its population to nearly 1,300, according to Saul and Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction records.

Violent attacks between inmates have increased 113 percent, and inmate attacks on staff by 73 percent since the prison went to two inmates per cell, Saul said.

"Toledo has a high employee turnover rate and that means less experienced officers dealing with the challenges of a higher security population," Saul said.

Seyfang said Oglesby's killing is under investigation. He had been transferred to the prison in February, she said.



headline: Ex-paramedic jailed after Texas explosion released on bail
byline: By Lisa Maria Garza
8:31am EDT

A former paramedic who responded to a deadly explosion at a Texas fertilizer plant in April, only to be charged weeks later with unlawful possession of pipe bomb components, was released from a county jail on Thursday.

A federal judge ordered Bryce Reed, 31, to be released on a $25,000 bond into the custody of his mother.

Reed was indicted in May for possession of an unregistered destructive device. Earlier he had become one of the faces of the rescue effort in the aftermath of the massive explosion in the town of West.

The West Fertilizer Co facility exploded on April 17 about 20 minutes after a fire was reported at the plant. The blast killed 14 people and badly damaged a residential area, including an apartment building, nursing home and school.

The cause of the fire remains unknown. Investigators say they have not eliminated the possibility that it was set intentionally.

This month McLennan County District Attorney Abel Reyna said a state law enforcement report on Reed concluded there was no evidence linking him to the incident. Reed has denied any involvement.

known faces of the town following the blast. When the fire broke out at the plant, he assisted in the evacuation, he told Reuters. He later learned that a close friend was among the dead.

His trial is due to begin at federal court in Waco on September 23.

On Thursday, Jonathan Sibley, Reed's attorney, said his client was "thrilled" with the judge's decision.

"We are glad the court reviewed the evidence and decided that Mr. Reed should be released pending his trial," Sibley said in an email. "We look forward to our day in court and addressing the allegations against Mr. Reed."



headline: Bradley Manning faces legal and social difficulties as transgender
byline: By Ellen Wulfhorst
8:31am EDT

Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier sentenced this week for leaking 700,000 classified documents to WikiLeaks in the biggest breach of secret data in the country's history, could soon be entangled in another legal showdown.

Unlike the court-martial Manning faced for leaking the data, the next challenge could play out in federal court over a far different issue: sexual identity.

Manning's announcement on Thursday of wishing to live as a woman named Chelsea raised unprecedented legal questions over whether the Army will provide the female hormone therapy Manning wants to undergo, not to mention questions over how life will unfold as a transgender military inmate.

"The prime issue concerns the manner in which Chelsea Manning will be treated in prison, and whether she will have the same access that all prisoners have to treatments that are prescribed to her," said Michael Silverman, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund in New York.

"Will the prison in which she is housed allow her doctors to treat her the same way they allow them to treat other prisoners?" he asked.

Manning, 25, was sentenced to 35 years at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, which houses military prisoners about 25 miles north of Kansas City, Kansas.

At Fort Leavenworth, Manning will have access to mental health professionals, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, social workers and behavioral science specialists, according to an Army spokeswoman.

But she said the Army did not provide hormone therapy, which is what Manning would seek, or gender-reassignment surgery.

"I'm hoping that Fort Leavenworth will do the right thing and provide that," Manning's attorney, David Coombs, said on the "Today" show. "If Fort Leavenworth does not, then I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that they are forced to do so."

Neal Minahan, a Boston lawyer who won a federal court decision in 2011 for his client to receive hormone therapy in a Massachusetts state prison, said federal judges have consistently knocked down bans on such therapy.

"What is very clear is that prisons cannot do exactly what Leavenworth is doing in saying that there is a blanket ban on hormone therapy as a matter of policy," he said.

But while Manning's first step would be getting a doctor's prescription for the treatment, the soldier will likely face years getting legal approval in the courts, Minahan said.

Manning's lawyers argued during the sentencing phase of the court-martial that the soldier suffered from gender identity disorder. Coombs said on Thursday that Manning has had feelings of being female since childhood.

The American Psychiatric Association in its newest diagnostic manual replaced "gender identity disorder" with "gender dysphoria" to remove the stigma associated with the diagnosis and avoid what it said was the incorrect indication that gender nonconformity was a mental disorder.

Prescribed treatments for gender dysphoria can range from hormones, which typically affects breast development and other secondary sex characteristics, to facial feminization and genital surgery.

Challenging the Army's policy on hormone therapy could have long-term broader benefits, said Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project at Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders, or GLAD.

In the Massachusetts case, she said, the ruling not only knocked down the policy but also helped launch training for prison staff.

"It's that kind of training and education that I think ultimately changes the ways people view the transgender experience," Levi said. "As there's more understanding of the medical condition, there's more humanity that is extended to people who experience it."

Coombs said he was not worried about Manning's safety in a military prison since inmates there were first-time offenders who wanted to complete their sentences and get out.

Still, experts said transgender inmates tend to be vulnerable or targeted, and steps taken to protect them can be punitive, such as segregation or isolated cells. Fort Leavenworth is an all-male prison. Female military prisoners are housed at the Naval Consolidated Brig Miramar in California.

A spokeswoman for the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Manning case.

"The worst case scenario is that she's going to experience harassment or abuse in prison as a result of being transgender," said Silverman, of the Transgender Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund. "That abuse might or could include the withholding of medical treatment.

"It's hard for people who haven't been diagnosed with gender dysphoria to understand quite how severe it can be to have treatment withheld," he said. "It can have profoundly debilitating effects on people."



headline: Planned Parenthood sues Indiana over abortion clinic requirements

called abortion pill to have full surgical facilities, a requirement it says would halt abortion services at a central Indiana clinic.

Under the law, Planned Parenthood would have to upgrade its clinic in Lafayette, Indiana, to surgical standards or stop administering RU-486, commonly called the abortion pill, it said in a lawsuit filed in Indianapolis federal court.

Imposing surgical facility requirements on clinics where no surgery is performed "is not only unreasonable, it is utterly irrational ...," Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky said in the lawsuit, which seeks a federal court injunction.

Legislators supporting the law, which took effect July 1, have said it would protect women's health. It requires clinics providing non-surgical abortions to have separate procedure, recovery and scrub rooms like surgical centers starting January 1.

Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a statement on Thursday that, "We look forward to respectfully asserting the state's case" in defending the constitutionality of the law.

Planned Parenthood operates four of the 10 clinics that provide abortions in Indiana. Three Planned Parenthood clinics perform surgical abortions and administer the abortion pill at up to nine weeks of pregnancy. The Lafayette clinic offers only the abortion pill at up to nine weeks of pregnancy.

The Lafayette clinic provided 54 non-surgical abortions in the 12 months ended July 1, and other medication, primarily contraception, more than 10,000 times, the lawsuit said.

If the Lafayette clinic stops providing non-surgical abortions, the closest clinics are 60 miles away in Indianapolis or 85 miles away in Merrillville, Planned Parenthood said, adding that the Lafayette clinic would continue to provide health services.

Planned Parenthood applied on July 15 with Indiana state health officials for a license and a waiver of the requirements.

The Indiana law exempts physician's offices from the requirements as long as surgical procedures performed there are not primarily surgical abortions and abortion-inducing drugs are not the primarily prescribed drugs.

The requirements violate a woman's constitutional right to privacy, equal protection and are "arbitrary and irrational" in violation of a woman's right to due process, the lawsuit said.

The two-pill abortion medication called RU-486 has been legally available in the United States since 2000. By 2008 it accounted for about one-fourth of U.S. abortions performed before nine weeks of gestation, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports the right to abortion.

As approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the drugs are dispensed by prescription directly from a physician. They are not available in pharmacies.

frisk policy that he argues is necessary to fight crime.

The council passed another measure, also opposed by the mayor, that would create a watchdog to monitor the New York Police Department.

The two bills are aimed at restricting police use of the stop-and-frisk policy in which officers in high-crime areas stop people on the basis of reasonable suspicion that they could be engaged in criminal activity.

The policy, strongly defended by Bloomberg, has come under increasing criticism, particularly from a federal judge who ruled it unconstitutional earlier this month.

Bloomberg released a strongly worded statement about the council, saying the votes were "an example of election year politics at its very worst and political pandering at its most deadly."

"Both bills outsource management of the NYPD to unaccountable officials, making it harder for the next mayor and police commissioner to make the decisions they believe necessary to keep our city safe," he said.

The council's inspector general bill creates an independent monitor over the police department for a seven-year period that would make recommendations on how the department could be improved. It passed by a vote of 39 to 10.

The stop-and-frisk measure expands the definition of racial profiling and allows people who believe they have been profiled to sue police in state court. It passed by a vote of 34-15.

"It's an historic day," said Council member Jumaane Williams, the lead sponsor of the bill. "We have a lot more work left to do. But I'm very happy that the council did its job, moving in the right direction when others wouldn't."

The city has taken the first steps toward an appeal of the ruling by U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin, who called stop-and-frisk "indirect racial profiling" that targeted racially defined groups, resulting in the disproportionate and discriminatory stopping of blacks and Hispanics.

Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly have argued that police make the most stops in minority neighborhoods because that is where crime rates are highest.

The council's inspector general bill takes effect on January 1, 2014, when the city will have a new mayor. The racial profiling bill takes effect in 90 days.

In June, the 51-member council passed the two laws with just enough support to override a veto.

Bloomberg vetoed the bills in July, challenging the council to override him with a two-thirds majority vote.

old Australian university student police say was murdered "for the fun of it" by three bored Oklahoma teenagers, has surpassed $113,000, according to the "gofundme" website.

The donations, which totaled $113,311 (AUD $125,524) as of Thursday afternoon, are to cover expenses for Lane's family to be able to fly to Oklahoma to receive his body and return him to Melbourne, the website said.

Lane, who was attending East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma, on a baseball scholarship, was killed by a gunshot in the back on Friday as he was jogging in Duncan, Oklahoma.

The organizer of the Christopher Lane Fund, Marshall Veal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On the website, he said that "through all the confusion and hard times we have been able to clear things up and Christopher Lane is being taken back to his family in Australia."

According to the Duncan Banner newspaper, Veal is a former teammate of Lane's.

Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards Jr., 15, have been charged with first degree murder, according to the Stephens County District Attorney's office. Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, has been charged with use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory to murder after the fact, the District Attorney's office said.

According to police, Jones said the three teens decided to kill someone "for the fun of it."

Police said Jones told them on Sunday that the three teenagers saw Lane out jogging and decided he would be their target, followed him in their vehicle and then shot him. Jones was driving the car, and Luna fired the gun, according to prosecutors.

California said on Thursday it would consider a soft launch of its Obamacare online health insurance exchange if tests of the new system next month show it isn't ready to accommodate wide public access.

If the system is not ready, the exchange would at first use an "aided enrollment" in which counselors help California residents sign up over the phone or in person.

Under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, millions of uninsured Americans will be able to sign up for new government subsidized health insurance plans starting on October 1 via online exchanges in each state.

But the scale of the effort, and the political resistance to the reform law in many states, has led to delays in implementation and raised questions about whether all 50 states will be ready by that date.

California, which embraced Obamacare early on, is considered one of the most crucial states for the administration's enrollment effort. The Covered California exchange said current tests of its technology are going well, with more complete results expected in early September, according to spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.

"So far everything is looking good," Hidalgo said. "Until the tests are done, we don't know the full extent of the functionality ... We are working to be fully functional by October 1."

Covered California discussed the issue with insurers on Wednesday as part of a regularly scheduled weekly meeting.

Earlier this month, Oregon decided to use a limited enrollment option in the first weeks of October to work through technical and other potential issues with the exchange.

Covered California aims to sign up 1 million to 1.4 million people in 2014. Overall, exchanges across the country are expected to provide coverage for 7 million people next year.

byline: By David Ingram
8:31am EDT

FBI Director Robert Mueller sought on Wednesday to dispel any perception among Americans that the bureau and the Justice Department let bankers go free after they helped bring about the U.S. financial crisis.

The complexity of the crisis made it difficult to identify what crimes might have occurred and to explain to Americans why there was a scarcity of prosecutions on Wall Street, Mueller told reporters in response to questions about the crisis.

Mueller was speaking in a rare interview 12 years into the job and just weeks before his September 4 departure.

"I would say that's a misperception. There were a number of contributing factors to the crash in 2008, and if you look at the statistics in terms of persons we've investigated and prosecuted, there are a number that are out there, and investigations are ongoing," said the 69-year-old former prosecutor and U.S. Marine.

"Often it's very difficult to put it all together and paint a picture that is persuasive when you have such disparate contributing factors to a particular crisis," he added, "but where we've found the evidence and we've followed the evidence, I think we have a pretty good track record."

The FBI granted the Wednesday interview on condition it not be reported until late on Thursday, to accommodate other interviews.

Mueller did not mention specific recent cases but said comparisons to earlier sweeps of white-collar crime, such as the savings-and-loan crisis that began in the late 1980s, were unfair. Back then, he said, "The cases were relatively easy to identify and were clear frauds."

While he called insider-trading cases an "offshoot" from the financial crisis, he said U.S. investigators should get credit for bringing those, too.

Mueller became FBI director a week before the hijacked plane attacks of September 11, 2001, on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon, a calamity that forced the bureau to shift radically its priorities and capabilities.

He will leave behind a very different FBI. More than half the agents began work there after the September 11 strikes, and the bureau's first priority - unquestioned in Washington - is to prevent a similar attack.

"I did not expect I'd be spending my time in preventing terrorist attacks," Mueller said. He had spent his career prosecuting crimes - including local murders in Washington - after they occurred, not preventing them.

Mueller's 12-year stint makes him the second longest-serving director in FBI history after J. Edgar Hoover.

"In the last 12 years, I think the American public has expected us to, yes, clean up the white-collar criminal activity, yes, handle public corruption, but most particularly to not allow another September 11 attack," he told reporters, sitting in a conference room at the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington.

With 36,000 employees, the FBI is the largest U.S. investigative agency and the closest thing the country has to a national police force. Its investigations cover not only counterterrorism but organized crime, financial fraud, cybercrime and more.

QUESTIONS ABOUT BOSTON, FORT HOOD

Mueller would not address several of the subjects reporters raised. He repeatedly declined to comment on the U.S. pursuit of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, charged under espionage laws for leaking secrets to newspapers.

Despite praise from lawmakers for the lack of another major attack on U.S. soil on his watch, Mueller said part of the success was luck. He also said he still wonders if more could have been done to prevent April's Boston Marathon bombing and the shooting in Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.

The two attacks share a pattern of "individuals acting pretty much on their own, without ties to a formalized terrorist group, not orchestrated overseas," he said, and the model would probably be replicated by others.

A government-ordered review of the Fort Hood shooting said the FBI had no specific knowledge that Major Nidal Hasan was planning the attack, but that the bureau should have interviewed him because it was in possession of emails Hasan had sent to a militant Muslim cleric.

A jury is weighing whether to convict Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 and wounding more than 30. His trial began last month.

An official review of the Boston bombing, in which two bombs exploded, killing three people and wounding about 260, has not been released.

After nearly an entire adult career in government, Mueller said he planned to spend time giving speeches, teaching and conducting private investigations. He said he had yet to decide whether to join a firm or start his own.

headline: U.S. suspends police assistance for St. Lucia over alleged killings
byline: By Sarah Peter
8:31am EDT

The United States has suspended assistance to the police department of the Caribbean island of St. Lucia as a result of allegations of serious human rights violations, the State Department confirmed on Thursday.

The government of St. Lucia was officially notified of the decision last Friday, the State Department said in a statement.

"The Department of State has made a policy decision to withdraw training and material assistance to the Royal St. Lucia Police force due to credible allegations of gross human rights violations," the statement said.

The island's prime minister, Kenny Anthony, acknowledged the cut off during an address to the nation on Tuesday evening, citing a U.S. law, known as the Leahy amendment after its principal sponsor, Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, which bars aid to foreign security forces accused of human rights violations.

Neither the State Department nor the St. Lucia government was immediately available to give the amount of the assistance.

It was unclear whether the U.S. action would have a significant impact on the small island of 163,000 inhabitants in the eastern Caribbean whose police force suffers from limited resources and is heavily dependent on foreign aid.

The allegations stem from 12 killings committed between 2010 and 2011, some of which were committed by an "ad hoc task force within the police department," a U.S. State Department Human Rights Report said.

The alleged extra-judicial killings stemmed from the circulation of a hit list targeting persons deemed to be criminals. Five suspects whose names were on that list were shot and killed during police operations.

Anthony, during his speech on Tuesday, confirmed seeing such a list while he was in the opposition.

The killings occurred during a government led by the United Workers Party under the leadership of then Prime Minister Stephenson King.

At the time, King issued a warning to criminals prior to the commencement of a police action, dubbed Operation Restore Confidence, saying they would be "hunted down," Anthony noted in his speech.

The prime minister promised to take immediate action to deal with the matter. "It is in our vital interest to maintain close ties of cooperation with the United States in security matters," he said, adding that he has invited CARICOM, the regional Caribbean community of nations, to identify three senior investigators to probe the killings.

"The investigators will be asked to evaluate all available evidence and determine whether or not these matters warrant further action," he said.

Anthony also said he planned to draw up new legislation to investigate extra-judicial police killings. "This measure is needed to ensure that a mechanism exists to deal with such situations in the future, should such unexplained or suspicious deaths occur."

pro football player Odin Lloyd.

Hernandez, a former New England Patriots tight end, appeared briefly in Attleboro District Court after being indicted in the shooting of Lloyd, whose bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial area near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

Hernandez, who did not speak during Thursday's brief hearing, has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts, including murder and weapons charges tied to Lloyd's death.

"Aaron Hernandez is an innocent man as we stand here today," Michael Fee, one of his attorneys, told reporters after the hearing. "There has been an incredible rush to judgment in this case ... It has been based on innuendo, misrepresentations of facts, hearsay and opinion has been represented as fact."

The indictment means the case will move to state superior court in Fall River, said Bristol District Attorney Sam Sutter.

"The investigation is ongoing," Sutter told reporters outside the court. "This was a very grave case. My heart goes out to the Lloyd family."

Hernandez, 23, was cut from the Patriots on June 26, shortly after police arrested him for purportedly orchestrating the execution-style murder.

Lloyd, 27, had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancĂŠe. Prosecutors said Hernandez soured on him a few nights before the body was found, and that the two had argued after Lloyd socialized at a nightclub with people Hernandez disliked.

Two other men have been arrested in connection with the case. Ernest Wallace, who turned himself in to police in Florida, has been accused of being an accessory after the fact, and Carlos Ortiz was arrested in Connecticut on charges of being a fugitive from justice.

Before his arrest, Hernandez had been a rising star in the NFL with a $41 million contract with one of the league's top teams.



headline: Massive fire near Yosemite National Park triples in size overnight
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

A wildfire raging out of control near Yosemite National Park in northern California ballooned to nearly 54,000 acres on Thursday, more than tripling in size from the day before, forest officials said.

The blaze, which is burning mostly in Stanislaus National Forest and has destroyed two homes and seven outbuildings since it broke out on Saturday, was only 2 percent contained despite efforts of more than 1,360 firefighters to tame it, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Trevor Augustino.

Augustino said the Rim Fire, named after a popular local lookout point, Rim of the World, is burning on rugged and remote terrain, which has made it challenging for firefighters to haul in hoses to damp the flames.

"The terrain is so difficult that you can't go into direct attack," Augustino said, adding that he expected a lot more firefighters to arrive on Friday as reinforcements.

The Rim Fire is the fourth-largest and fastest growing wildfire in the nation, said National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Robyn Broyles. It is one of 50 large wildfires burning throughout the U.S. West.

On Wednesday, the fire had been 5 percent contained and ranged across only 16,000 acres, but it grew dramatically overnight and the containment level fell.

Two evacuation centers have been set up for residents in the area, Augustino said.

Residents have been urged, but not required, to leave their homes if they have health conditions that could be affected by the rising level of smoke in the air, Augustino said. He said he did not know how many residents had chosen to evacuate or were using the shelters.

"There are a lot of little pockets of residences throughout this area," he said, adding that the fire has started to spread to private land and was roughly five miles from the northwest outer edge of Yosemite National Park.

Yosemite National Park, spanning 750,000-acres and best known for its waterfalls, attracted nearly 4 million visitors in 2012, according to the park website.

Park officials on Tuesday were forced to stop westbound traffic on Highway 120, one of four access routes to the park, due to the fire. But they have no immediate plans to close the park, said Yosemite park ranger Scott Gediman. He added that the sky was clear and free of smoke over Yosemite on Thursday.

The cause of the Rim Fire is unknown and under investigation, Augustino said



headline: Dozens injured when tour bus overturns outside Los Angeles

A tour bus ferrying passengers to a California casino skidded and flipped onto its side on a freeway outside Los Angeles on Thursday, injuring about 50 people who were thrown around inside the vehicle, authorities said.

No one died in the accident, said Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Captain Brian Jordan.

The crash left the bus, operated by Da Zhen Bus company, on its side on a dirt embankment next to the eastbound lanes of the Foothill Freeway in Irwindale, less than 20 miles east of Los Angeles. Traffic along the freeway at one point was snarled for six miles , said California Highway Patrol spokesman Officer Saul Gomez.

The tour bus was carrying Chinese-speaking passengers, apparently residents of greater Los Angeles, who were traveling to a local Indian casino, Gomez said.

A total of 55 people were hurt in the crash, including about 50 on board the bus and a few people in two other vehicles struck by the bus, Gomez said. Most were transported to local hospitals but some were treated at scene, he said.

Five patients needing immediate care were airlifted to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center and their conditions were guarded but stable with none in surgery, Dr. Leo Rodriguez, who was caring for patients from the crash, told reporters outside the hospital.

They had suffered "blunt force trauma from a rollover bus accident," he said.

The passengers aboard the bus were 50 years and older, Rodriguez said.

Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena received the other three most seriously injured patients - an 86-year-old man with rib fractures and two women in their 70s, said hospital spokesman Kevin Andrus. None of their injuries were life-threatening, he said.

The bus went into a "lockwheel skid" before it turned over and ended up on its side next to the freeway, Gomez said. The cause of the crash is under investigation, he said.

A representative from Da Zhen Bus declined to comment.



headline: Bradley Manning wants to live as a woman named Chelsea
byline: By Susan Heavey and Ian Simpson
8:31am EDT

Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier sentenced to 35 years in military prison for the biggest breach of classified documents in the nation's history, said on Thursday he is female and wants to live as a woman named Chelsea.

Manning, 25, launched an unprecedented bid to get female hormone treatment in a military prison a day after he was sentenced for leaking documents to the WikiLeaks website.

"As I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know the real me. I am Chelsea Manning, I am a female," Manning said in the statement read by anchorwoman Savannah Guthrie on NBC News' "Today" show.

During the sentencing phase of Manning's court-martial for leaking more than 700,000 secret documents, defense attorneys pointed out that the soldier suffered from gender identity disorder. A psychologist testified Manning had a difficult time adjusting to the "hypermasculine environment" of a combat zone.

Manning said in the statement that he wished to begin receiving hormone therapy while serving his sentence in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

A spokeswoman said the Army did not provide hormone therapy or gender-reassignment surgery, but that military inmates have access to mental health professionals, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, social workers and behavioral science specialists.

"Given the way that I feel and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible," Manning said in the statement. "I also request that starting today you refer to me by my new name and use the feminine pronoun."

Manning's lawyer David Coombs said on the TV program he expected his client to get a pardon from U.S. President Barack Obama. Manning, who was convicted last month at Fort Meade, Maryland, on 20 charges, including espionage and theft, could be eligible for parole in seven years.

During the trial, Coombs had argued that Manning had been increasingly isolated and under intense stress when he leaked the files, and that his superiors had ignored warning signs.

Coombs said his client was not seeking gender-reassignment surgery, but he would press Fort Leavenworth to provide hormone therapy for Manning.

"I'm hoping that Fort Leavenworth will do the right thing and provide that. If Fort Leavenworth does not, then I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that they are forced to do so," Coombs said.

'COMFORTABLE IN HER SKIN'

Asked if Manning wanted to be sent to a women's prison, Coombs said no.

"I think the ultimate goal is to be comfortable in her skin and to be the person that she's never had an opportunity to be," he said.

Coombs said he was not worried about Manning's safety in a military prison since inmates there were first-time offenders who wanted to complete their sentences and get out.

Experts generally view military prisons as safer than civilian prisons since the inmates are accustomed to hierarchy and discipline.

Manning had not wanted his sexual identity issues to become public, but they did after his arrest in 2010, Coombs said.

"Now that it is (public), unfortunately you have to deal with it in a public manner," he said.

A psychiatrist, Navy Reserve Captain David Moulton, testified during Manning's trial that the soldier suffered from gender dysphoria, or wanting to be the opposite sex, as well as narcissism and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Geoffrey Corn, a military law expert at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, called Manning's bid for hormone treatment the first of its kind for the military. Openly gay members were barred from serving until the Pentagon's "don't ask, don't tell" policy was repealed in 2011.

"We don't have any precedent for the application of military medical care for elective gender reassignment therapy," he said.

Corn was skeptical that Manning would get approval for hormone therapy since federal courts have traditionally given the military deference for its life and activities.

"I don't see it happening," he said.

Chase Stangio, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Project, said in a statement that the Army's saying it did not provide hormone therapy raised "serious constitutional issues."

Courts have consistently found that denying medical care for gender dysphoria to prisoners based on blanket exclusions violates the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which bars cruel and unusual punishment, Stangio said.

headline: U.S. soldier behind Afghan massacre apologizes for 'act of cowardice'
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

A decorated U.S. soldier who gunned down 16 unarmed Afghan civilians in a nighttime rampage last year apologized on Thursday at a sentencing hearing to determine his fate, calling the killings "an act of cowardice."

Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, a veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, has admitted to shooting the villagers, mostly women and children, in attacks on their family compounds in Kandahar province in March 2012.

"I am truly, truly sorry to all the people whose family members I have taken away. I have murdered their families," Bales told a jury in a military courtroom in Washington state, choking up at times. "What I did is an act of cowardice."

Bales pleaded guilty to the killings in June in a deal that will spare him the death penalty. A jury of six military personnel will ultimately decide if he will spend the rest of his natural life in prison or be eligible for parole after 20 years. Closing arguments are due on Friday.

Defense lawyers have been seeking to show that Bales suffered a breakdown under the pressure of his final deployment to Afghanistan. They have argued that he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his last deployment to Afghanistan.

"I don't think anybody with a rational mind could say Bob Bales didn't snap," Browne told reporters on Wednesday after the court-martial session before a military jury.

Army prosecutors have said Bales acted alone and with premeditation when, armed with a pistol, a rifle and a grenade launcher, he left his base twice during the night, returning in the middle of his rampage to tell a fellow soldier, "I just shot up some people."

The killings marked the worst case of civilian deaths blamed on a U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.

ANGER ISSUES

Speaking slowly and deliberately, Bales told the jury he had struggled with anger issues that worsened after his third military deployment.

He said trivial issues like dirty dishes in the sink would make him angry, and that he was "mad at myself for being mad." He briefly sought treatment between his third and fourth deployments, but felt it was not working and stopped.

"I was a coward for stopping. If you have a problem and you seek help, it's not weakness, it's strength," he said. Under military court rules, he was not subject to cross examination.

Prosecutors had said they hoped to show that Bales had a pattern of bad behavior that predated his deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.

The prosecution rested its case on Wednesday after calling witnesses that included nine Afghans who had been flown to the United States to testify, among them a man who lost six of his seven children and other members of his family. Army spokeswoman Major Allison Aguilar said those witnesses had been given the opportunity to be in the courtroom but they were not present for Bales' statement.

"I hope that the people that traveled so far to come here, I hope they translate this so I can tell them I'm sorry. If I could bring their family members back, I would in a heartbeat. I can't comprehend their loss. I think about it every time I look at my kids," Bales said.

A father of two, Bales also apologized to his military colleagues, fighting back tears as he spoke.

"I love the Army. I stood next to some really good guys, some real heroes," he said. "I can't say I'm sorry to those guys enough."

Bales, who has claimed his memory of the killings is spotty, acknowledged them upon pleading guilty in June and told the court at that time there was "not a good reason in this world" for his actions.

During a nine-day pre-trial hearing last fall, witnesses testified that Bales had been upset by a bomb blast near his outpost that severed a fellow soldier's leg days before the shootings.



headline: U.S. judge overturns Colorado city's sex offender residency law
byline: By Keith Coffman
8:31am EDT

A federal judge has struck down a Colorado city's ordinance that restricts where registered sex offenders can reside, ruling that it conflicts with a state law requiring parolees to be reintegrated into society.

U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson in Denver ruled that the city of Englewood, a Denver suburb, could not impose restrictions that "leave essentially no place for such offenders to live for all intents and purposes."

The city's ordinance barred convicted sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of schools, parks or playgrounds, or within 1,000 feet of day-care facilities, recreation centers and trails, swimming pools, bus stops and school routes.

Jackson noted in his 24-page opinion that cities may impose reasonable constraints on where sex offenders can live, but he said Englewood and five other Colorado cities with similar laws have gone too far.

"In theory, every city and county could enact a similar 'not in my backyard' ordinance and effectively ban sex offenders ... from the entire state," he said.

A number of local governments and states across the country have enacted laws banning sex offenders from living near parks and schools, including California, Texas, Kentucky, Florida and Georgia.

The ruling stemmed from the case of Brett Ryals, a former soccer coach who was sentenced to seven years on probation after pleading guilty to having an unlawful sexual relationship with an underage girl who was one of his players.

Ryals was sentenced to two years in prison after violating his probation by continuing to see his victim. He completed his sentence and other requirements and was ultimately paroled.

He then purchased a home in Englewood. But when he registered as required with police in the suburb of 30,000 people south of Denver, he was told that his residence was within a restricted area.

A lawsuit challenging the restrictions was brought on his behalf by the Colorado chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Mark Silverstein, the ACLU's legal director in Colorado, said cities that pass such laws provide "a false sense of security" to their residents.

"Instead, they make communities less safe by interfering with offenders' efforts to reintegrate into safe, stable, and supportive environments," Silverstein said. "And when town after town enacts similar restrictions, it poses the risk that sex offenders are driven underground and disconnected from treatment and supervision."

Jackson said the ordinance pushes offenders into neighboring communities, creating a conflict with the "the state interest in the uniform treatment, management, rehabilitation, and reintegration of sex offenders during and after state supervision."

Officials from Denver also complained that Englewood's policy was forcing offenders into their city, he added.

Silverstein said the ACLU has challenged similar laws in other states, but the Colorado case was different because the agency charged by the state legislature with monitoring paroled sex offenders publicly opposed the measures in Englewood and other towns.

"What sets this apart is the Sex Offender Management Board urged them (municipalities) not to enact theses ordinances," he said.

Englewood's deputy city manager, Michael Flaherty, said the city's legal staff was reviewing the opinion before deciding its next step.



headline: Atlanta area shooting revives issue of gun access and mental health

47 in a suburban Atlanta elementary school has a history of mental illness and once threatened in a Facebook message to kill his brother, according to the suspect's lawyer and family.

A school clerk convinced Michael Brandon Hill to lay down his gun and turn himself in after he walked into the school carrying 500 rounds of ammunition and briefly exchanged gunfire with police. No students were injured in the incident.

Claudia Saari, a public defender, described Hill as having a "long" history of mental health issues. "Mr. Hill is being represented by members of our Mental Health Division," she said.

The shooting was the latest involving a gunman suffering from a mental health problem, an issue that has raised questions over whether background checks go far enough in examining potential gun buyers.

A spate of shootings at U.S. schools has also reignited a public debate about how to improve safety, with some gun rights advocates calling for more armed security guards and training for teachers to carry weapons.

The Atlanta incident came less than a year after a heavily armed gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, killing 20 children and six adults.

Timothy Hill, the brother of the Atlanta gunman, told police he received threatening messages on Facebook from his brother, including one that stated he would "shoot him in the head and not think twice about it," a December 2012 police report said.

Timothy Hill said at the time "he was in fear for his life" and wanted to pursue charges against his brother, the report said. He told officers his brother was under a doctor's care because of his mental issues, according to the report.

Michael Hill was sentenced in July to three years probation and ordered to attend anger management classes for the threat made against his brother, according to Henry County Court records.

Police in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur and school officials praised Antoinette Tuff, a school clerk at the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy, with preventing a potential tragedy by persuading Hill to put his weapon down and end the ordeal.

"She was just smart enough, brave enough, compassionate enough to stop him," Michael Thurmond, interim superintendent of the DeKalb County school system, told CNN.

In a recording of a 911 call released by police, Tuff can be heard calmly talking Hill out of causing harm and reassuring him that giving up was the right thing to do.

"It's going to be all right sweetheart," she told Hill as he discarded his weapon, emptied his pockets and waited for police to enter the school.

Tuff, who was relaying messages from Hill to police, spoke at length with Hill, telling him "we all go through something in life" and explaining how she tried to commit suicide after her husband of 33 years left her last year.

At the end, Hill lay face down on the floor so police could come in and arrest him.

Tuff can be heard on the 911 call telling the police dispatcher, "I'll buzz them in. Tell them not to come in shooting."

Authorities are trying to piece together how Hill obtained his gun.

47 was purchased by an individual from a federally licensed gun dealer.

She declined to say who purchased the weapon.

Students at the school returned to the building on Thursday for the first time after the shooting, said Quinn Hudson, a DeKalb County school system spokesman.

Crisis counselors were on hand to talk with students, he said.

Students who spoke with counselors were not afraid but wanted "reassurance that everything is OK," Hudson said.



headline: Kidnapped California teen taken to Idaho calls herself a survivor
byline: By Dan Whitcomb and Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

old California girl kidnapped by a man and taken to Idaho after he killed her mother and younger brother, said in a television interview that she considers herself a survivor who was raised to be strong.

The interview, which aired on Wednesday, comes just over a week after Anderson was rescued in the Idaho wilderness by FBI agents who shot and killed her captor, 40-year-old James Lee DiMaggio.

Anderson's statements to NBC, in her first mainstream media interview since the ordeal, were aired on the network's "Nightly News" as a snippet of a full interview to be shown Thursday morning on the "Today" program.

"In the beginning, I was a victim but now, knowing everyone out there is helping me, I consider myself a survivor instead," Anderson told NBC News.

"My mom raised me to be strong," she said.

Anderson is believed to have taken to the social media website ask.fm just days after her rescue to field dozens of questions from strangers about her kidnapping, but she has otherwise remained silent about what she endured.

DNA TESTS CONSIDERED

In other developments on Wednesday, a spokesman for DiMaggio's family said they want more answers from police and have considered seeking DNA tests to determine if DiMaggio was the biological father of Hannah Anderson and her slain 8-year-old brother, Ethan.

old Christina Anderson and her son, Ethan, and set fire to his rural San Diego area home, which was discovered burning on August 4, Andrew Spanswick told Reuters in an interview.

Spanswick was a friend of both DiMaggio and his sister, Lora Robinson, and has acted as a spokesman for the DiMaggio family.

"Lora is in a position of extreme grief and distress and she's looking for any sort explanation of how her brother could have changed from the person she knew into what he is accused of," Spanswick said of DiMaggio's sister.

The remains of Christina Anderson were found under a tarp in DiMaggio's log-cabin-style home in Boulevard, about 25 miles east of San Diego, and an autopsy found she died from blunt force trauma to the head.

The badly burned body of Ethan Anderson was found in a different part of the wreckage than his mother.

DiMaggio was discovered with Hannah Anderson on August 10 at a mountain lake in the remote Idaho wilderness and was shot to death by an FBI agent during an operation to rescue the girl.

Police have described DiMaggio as a longtime friend of Christina Anderson who was treated like an uncle to her children Hannah and Ethan.

Spanswick said members of DiMaggio's family had not made a formal request for DNA from Hannah or Ethan Anderson, but have raised the issue as they seek a fuller understanding of the events leading up to the murders and kidnapping.

A San Diego County Sheriff's spokesman, Jan Caldwell, said on Wednesday that no requests had been made to the department for DNA from Ethan Anderson. Representatives of the Anderson family could not be reached for comment.

Caldwell said that sheriff's investigators had confirmed that DiMaggio and Hannah Anderson were photographed in his car at 12:10 a.m. on August 4, some 20 hours before the house went up in flames.

Christina and Ethan Anderson were last seen alive on August 3 at their home in the San Diego community of Lakeside, and Hannah Anderson was picked up from a high school cheerleading event at Sweetwater High School in nearby National City that afternoon.

Authorities have not publicly discussed any possible motives for DiMaggio's actions. A family friend has said the suspect developed an apparent infatuation with the high school girl that made Hannah feel uncomfortable.



headline: U.S. sues Texas over voter ID law
byline: By David Ingram
8:31am EDT

The U.S. government sued on Thursday to keep Texas from carrying out a voter identification requirement enacted in 2011, setting up a new battle between the Obama administration and a state that is a conservative stronghold.

The Justice Department said in a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Corpus Christi that Texas state lawmakers passed the requirement to deny racial minorities the right to vote and, unlike other states with similar laws, failed to take steps to prevent the law from being discriminatory.

A federal court in Washington blocked the Texas law in August 2012, but its ruling was undone in June when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

"We will not allow the Supreme Court's recent decision to be interpreted as open season for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights," U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement.

Separately, the Justice Department filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff in a Texas redistricting lawsuit brought on behalf of minority voters.

Voter ID laws - which require government-issued identification before voting - have become a political and racial flashpoint across the country. Democrats generally oppose the measures and many Republicans back them.

Supporters say they are needed to deter people from illegally casting ballots, while opponents say voter fraud is exaggerated in order to mask purposeful suppression of Democratic constituencies.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, called the Justice Department suit "gutter politics" and "offensive to the overwhelming majority of Texans of all races who support this ballot integrity measure." He has said he will defend the state's voter ID law and redistricting plans in court.

In its ruling a year ago, the federal court in Washington said Texas failed to ensure that voters could obtain ID cards free of charge, noting that people would have to pay to obtain a certified copy of their birth certificate or other proof of their ID and travel to a state office to present it.

Critics argue that such conditions effectively deny voting rights to people without means.

The courts and the Justice Department have allowed voter ID laws in states that guaranteed that voters would face no additional costs as a result of the laws.

Voting rights lawyers have said they expect the Justice Department to sue other jurisdictions, possibly North Carolina over its new voter ID law, as it looks for ways to protect minority voters.

Without naming any states, Holder, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said that the Texas lawsuit "represents the department's latest action to protect voting rights, but it will not be our last."

headline: New York town warned over pension payment deferrals
byline: By Edward Krudy

strapped municipalities.

The announcement on Wednesday is a warning to around 200 other municipalities in the state that have deferred more than $2 billion in pension payments over the last three years.

"Deferring current operating expenses to (a) future period is inconsistent with our view of strong financial management," Moody's Investors Service said in a statement. "Continued amortization of annual pension payments could result in a downgrade."

Moody's current Aaa rating for Huntington is the highest investment grade, but the negative outlook means the rating could be cut to Aa1, potentially pushing up the town's borrowing costs. The outlook affects $112 million in outstanding debt and a previously unrated $13.4 million of public improvement bonds.

Municipalities pay contributions for their public employees into a $160 billion system that is administered by the state.

Moody's and Huntington did not respond to requests for comment.

Reuters reported earlier this year that public pension system deferrals by New York's municipalities had quadrupled since 2011 and could accelerate under new rules introduced this year that allow municipalities to divert even more pension money.

Public employers deferred $1.1 billion in the fiscal year ended in March 2013, up from $293.2 million in 2011, a near fourfold increase, according to data from the New York state's Comptroller's office.

The number of public employers using deferrals jumped to nearly 200 in the fiscal year just ended from around 50 two years earlier. About 3,000 employers pay into the system.

The Comptroller's office, which signed off on more liberal deferral rules introduced by state Governor Andrew Cuomo for the current fiscal year, declined to comment.

The Moody's report said Huntingdon had deferred about one-third of required contributions last year. The required payments are determined by actuaries who match future pension obligations with current payment needs.

The deferral program, known as amortization, is designed to help municipalities bridge a spike in contribution rates following the financial crisis. Contributions are expected to fall after 2015, following years of strong market performance.

This year the amounts that the state's municipal employers are required to pay by actuarial formulas are 20.5 percent of the annual wage bills for the Employees Retirement System (ERS) and 28.9 percent for the Police and Fire Retirement System (PFRS).

In 2001, the year after the bubble in technology stocks had peaked, the rates were 0.9 percent for the ERS and 1.6 percent for the PFRS.

Critics say deferring payments risks undermining the integrity of public pensions by creating unfunded liabilities in the system while simply pushing the financial burdens faced by municipalities further into the future.

headline: Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout argues conviction appeal
byline: By Nate Raymond
8:31am EDT

Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout urged a U.S. appeals court on Thursday to reverse his 2011 conviction for conspiracy to kill Americans, arguing he was a victim of a "vindictive" prosecution.

Albert Dayan, a lawyer for Bout, said there was no legitimate law enforcement reason for targeting a man he claimed evidence showed was no longer in the arms business.

Bout, 46, is serving a 25-year prison sentence for conspiring to sell arms to people he thought were Colombian rebels who intended to kill U.S. soldiers. His case has strained relations between Washington and Moscow, which has demanded the return of the onetime Soviet air force officer.

Bout, the subject of the book "Merchant of Death" and the inspiration for Nicholas Cage's character in the 2005 movie "Lord of War," supplied military-grade weaponry to conflict zones around the world, according to prosecutors.

He was arrested in Bangkok in 2008 in a sting operation in which U.S. informants posed as representatives of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

Prosecutors said Bout demonstrated an intent to sell a massive arsenal of weaponry to FARC to use against American personnel in Colombia. He was extradited to New York in 2010.

A jury found him guilty in November 2011 on two counts of conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers of the United States, and one count each of conspiracy to sell anti-aircraft missiles and providing material support to a terrorist organization.

In his appeal, Bout contends he was convicted on an "non-crime" in a case initiated by the National Security Agency or White House and carried out by the DEA for political reasons.

"It's seldom the DEA receives orders from the White House to deliver someone's head on a silver platter," Dayan said at a hearing before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday.

Anjan Sahni, a lawyer for the Justice Department, said the U.S. government had targeted Bout, but for legitimate reasons, namely "because of the very clear and present danger he posed."

While Bout's lawyer said his client had given up arms dealing by the time of the sting, Sahni said evidence showed he had at the time been engaged in potential deals in places such as Libya and Tanzania.

"There's not remotely any abuse of discretion in this case," Sahni said.

Members of the three-judge appellate panel posed a series of seemingly skeptical questions to arguments by Dayan.

"Why are these weapons being sold?" Circuit Judge Danny Chin asked. "Isn't it the logical conclusion they're being sold to kill someone?"



headline: Doctors to take stand for U.S. soldier's defense in Afghan massacre case
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

Attorneys for the U.S. soldier who massacred 16 unarmed Afghan civilians last year will call witnesses on Thursday as they try to show he suffered a breakdown under the pressure of his final deployment to Afghanistan.

The first witnesses to be called by the defense in the sentencing phase of Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales' trial will be a number of medical doctors flown in from across the United States, his attorney John Henry Browne told reporters.

Defense testimony on Wednesday appeared aimed at telling the story of Bales' transformation from a dutiful young man to a soldier who his civilian attorney says broke under the pressure of overseas deployment.

"I don't think anybody with a rational mind could say Bob Bales didn't snap," Browne told reporters on Wednesday after the court-martial session before a military jury.

A decorated veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, Bales pleaded guilty in June in a deal that will spare him the death penalty. The jury will decide if he will spend the rest of his life in prison or if he will be eligible for parole after 20 years.

After Bales' brother testified on his behalf of Wednesday, Browne he planned to call up to 10 more witnesses, including Bales himself and the doctors.

William Bales on Wednesday described his brother as a good-natured young man who felt duty-bound to enlist in the Army in the aftermath of al Qaeda attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.

The prosecution rested its case on Wednesday after calling to the stand a string of witnesses including nine Afghans, among them a man who lost six of his seven children.

They testified to the devastating toll inflicted by Bales on civilians before dawn on March 11, 2012, during two forays from his military base in Kandahar province.

Bales' attorneys have said he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his deployment to Afghanistan.

Browne said on Wednesday that the defense's final witness would be Bales himself, who under military court rules would be exempt from cross-examination.

The killings marked the worst case of civilian deaths blamed on a rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.



headline: Obama unveils plan that aims to make college more affordable
byline: By Jeff Mason and Elvina Nawaguna
8:31am EDT

President Barack Obama on Thursday proposed a plan to tackle soaring U.S. education costs with a new system that judges colleges and universities on their financial value and ties those ratings to disbursement of federal aid.

The president, who has spent much of the summer promoting new ideas to rev up the economy, unveiled his proposals at the start of a campaign-like bus tour through New York and Pennsylvania.

The plan calls on the Education Department to institute a new ratings system before the 2015 school year that would allow students and parents to select schools based on the best value for the money.

Obama would then push Congress to tie federal student aid to these ratings by 2018, creating an incentive for schools to keep their costs in check.

The plan also aims to ease the pain of federal student loan debt by limiting those payments to 10 percent of borrowers' monthly income.

Major parts of the plan require congressional approval, which may prove difficult. And universities, many of which are already facing a cash crunch, are expected to push back against a ratings system that may be more difficult to influence than private-sector ranking systems.

After landing in Buffalo and greeting Governor Andrew Cuomo - a potential Democratic candidate for president in 2016 - Obama boarded a big black bus that appeared to be the one that took him through political swing states last year during his re-election battle against Republican Mitt Romney.

The campaign atmosphere is part of a White House strategy to generate attention for the president's proposals and gear up for a fall fight with congressional Republicans over the budget, debt ceiling and implementation of the president's signature healthcare reform, known as Obamacare.

Obama began his remarks at The State University of New York with an attack on Republicans for continuing their quest to repeal the health law. Republican lawmakers are considering using an upcoming showdown over the U.S. borrowing limit as leverage to delay the law's implementation.

But his main focus was education. Obama wants to bring down tuition costs at U.S. colleges and universities, which have skyrocketed, forcing students and families to take on more debt to afford a college degree.

"At a time when a higher education has never been more important or more expensive, too many students are facing a choice that they should never have to make," Obama said.

"Either they say no to college, and pay the price for not getting a degree ... or you do what it takes to go to college, but then you run the risk that you won't be able to pay it off because you've got so much debt."

The average annual cost of in-state tuition and fees for 2013 at four-year public universities was $8,655, up 4.8 percent from 2012, according to a survey from the College Board released this month.

Private colleges and universities are vastly more expensive.

The federal government provides more than $150 billion in student financial aid each year, and typically that aid has been based on enrollment figures, not the value of the education.

REPUBLICAN CONCERNS

John Kline, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce, expressed reservations about Obama's plan.

"I remain concerned that imposing an arbitrary college ranking system could curtail the very innovation we hope to encourage - and even lead to federal price controls," he said in a statement.

Andrew Kelly, director of the Center on Higher Education at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the president's proposals could motivate institutions to make some changes. But he said higher education lobbyists and some lawmakers may argue such a system could create a great disparity among colleges.

"The political fight is going to be very interesting," he said.

Secretary of Education Arne Duncan told reporters traveling with Obama on Air Force One earlier on Thursday that the system would still leave aid options open for students who chose pricier institutions.

"Folks will still have choice, but we want to make sure that good actors are being rewarded," he said.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the total cost of higher education - including tuition, room and board - for undergraduates at four-year public institutions ballooned 73 percent to an average of $15,900 per year in 2011 compared to 2001.

Americans now owe about $1.2 trillion in student loan debt, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimates. Obama said that debt was crippling to the U.S. economy.

If costs put college out of reach for too many young people, the United States could find itself at a disadvantage compared to other countries.

Obama earlier this month signed legislation that reversed a big hike in student loan interest rates and will tie future rates to fluctuations in the 10-year Treasury note. The bill was hammered out in intensive negotiations with lawmakers.

Over the last five years, the president has rolled out a number of college affordability initiatives, including increasing Pell Grant aid to low-income students, steps to encourage colleges to be more transparent about costs, and awarding grants to states and institutions that work to bring costs down.



headline: San Diego mayor accused of harassment reaches proposed settlement
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

San Diego Mayor Bob Filner and the city reached a proposed settlement on Wednesday in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by his former press secretary, the city attorney told reporters.

The disclosure of the settlement on the third day of negotiations came on the same day a former star of a reality television show became the 18th woman to publicly accuse Filner of groping or other inappropriate behavior, in a scandal that has rocked California's second largest city.

Filner has come under mounting pressure to resign amid a torrent of sexual harassment allegations leveled at him, starting with his former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, who sued the mayor and the city on July 22.

The San Diego City Council in July filed a cross-complaint against Filner seeking to recover from him any damages the city might face in the lawsuit.

"We have reached a proposed resolution," City Attorney Jan Goldsmith, who was flanked by two City Council members and attorneys for Filner, told reporters gathered outside the downtown office building where talks were held.

Goldsmith did not disclose the scope of the proposed settlement, but he said that it will be presented to the San Diego City Council in closed session on Friday. "We won't have more to discuss until Friday afternoon," he said.

High-profile attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing the former press secretary, has called for Filner to resign. Goldsmith, who is acting on behalf of the City Council and not the mayor in the case, told local television station KNSD earlier this month that settlement talks would give the mayor a potential "out" to litigation, although Goldsmith stopped short of saying that had to involve the mayor's resignation.

A source close to an individual involved in the talks, when asked whether the proposed settlement would require Filner to resign, said, "I think it's fair to say that looks like it's in the cards."

Filner, meanwhile, was spotted inside City Hall on Wednesday in what was believed to be the first sighting of him there since he took a brief leave of absence to enter behavioral modification therapy early this month.

But neither his office nor his lawyers have replied to repeated queries this week about whether the 70-year-old Democrat and former U.S. congressman has fully resumed his duties as the city's top elected official.

Negotiations aimed at reaching a settlement began on Monday at a downtown office building near City Hall. No talks were planned for Thursday, Goldsmith said.

The sessions were presided over by a retired federal judge, J. Lawrence Irving, a respected mediator, who has asked all parties to refrain from discussing the talks publicly, Goldsmith said.

'ADDICTED TO BEAUTY'

Since Jackson filed her suit last month, 17 more women have come forward to accuse Filner of making unwanted advances, the latest being Dianne York, 50, who starred in a short-lived reality show about cosmetic surgery on the Oxygen Channel cable network called "Addicted to Beauty."

York, who has acknowledged on the show's website that she has undergone "more than five and less than 10" cosmetic surgical procedures herself, was depicted on the series as launching a business partnership with a prominent plastic surgeon to open a day spa in San Diego.

At a news conference on Wednesday, York said the mayor put his hand on her buttocks when she posed with him for a photo at his office in May following a meeting to discuss what she called an illegal foreclosure on her business, the Spa of La Jolla.

"I was shocked," she said. "It was inappropriate." She gave few other details except to say she reported the incident to the county sheriff's department, which has set up a hot line to field complaints about alleged misconduct by the mayor.

County court records show York has been involved in more than a dozen lawsuits during the past three years, some of them disputes with her own attorneys.

Among the other women who have alleged sexual harassment by Filner were a retired U.S. Navy admiral, a college dean, a licensed vocational nurse, several business women and two military veterans who were victims of unrelated sexual assaults in the armed forces.

Filner has so far refused to step down but has apologized for what he acknowledged was a pattern of disrespectful and intimidating behavior toward women.

On August 5, he entered a treatment at an undisclosed behavioral counseling clinic. His lawyers said he left the clinic after several days but was taking additional time off last week before planning to return to work this week.

On Sunday, volunteers began collecting signatures for a petition seeking to oust Filner through a recall election. Organizers said that as of Tuesday night they had collected 11,000 of the 102,000 signatures needed by September 26 to qualify a recall for the ballot.

Officials from the city attorney's office and Filner's lawyers also were believed to be taking part in the sessions, and Filner himself was seen entering that office building on Monday.

headline: Fort Hood shooter rests defense case without calling witnesses

martial on Wednesday without calling any witnesses to testify.

Major Nidal Hasan, acting as his own defense attorney, has remained largely passive in court since telling the jury in opening arguments, "The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter."

Colonel Tara Osborn, a military judge, asked Hasan if anyone had forced him into his decision to dispense with witnesses and rest his case. "No, ma'am," he replied.

On Tuesday, military prosecutors rested their case in the capital murder court-martial of Hasan, an American-born Muslim who said he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war against Islam.

Hasan spared victims who testified against him from cross-examination and so far has avoided using his court-martial as a platform for his religious beliefs, though he will be given another chance in closing arguments set for Thursday.

Shot by police during the incident, the 42-year-old is paralyzed from the waist down and attends court in a wheelchair.

The shooting rampage on November 5, 2009, came at a time of heightened tensions over the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which strained relations between the United States and countries with predominantly Muslim populations.

Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing, praised Hasan as a hero and "a man of conscience." U.S. intelligence officials say Hasan had sent emails to Awlaki, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011. The judge blocked those emails from being submitted as evidence in the trial.

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges against Hasan, who could face the death penalty if all 13 officers on the jury find him guilty of premeditated murder.

Hasan faces 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of premeditated attempted murder for the 31 people injured plus one he shot at and missed.

The judge delayed ruling on whether to give the jury the option of considering lesser homicide offenses such as unpremeditated murder or voluntary manslaughter.

When prosecutors argued, with the jury absent, against the option of manslaughter, Hasan interjected. But rather than rebut the prosecution's point, he agreed.

"I would like to agree that it wasn't done under the heat of passion. There was adequate provocation because these were soldiers that were deploying in an illegal war. That was the provocation," Hasan said.

Prosecutors called 89 witnesses in two weeks of testimony, with many describing in horrific detail the bloodbath in and around a medical building at Fort Hood.

Hasan told mental health evaluators he wanted to become a martyr, court documents show. Lawyers assisting him say he is seeking the death penalty, but he has disputed that claim.

sex marriage licenses.

He said the first same-sex couple that walked in to obtain a license said they had waited 31 years to wed.

"Maybe I'm jumping the gun, but so be it," Ellins said, adding he supports gay marriage because he believes "equal protection should apply to everyone."

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage. Unlike in many other states, New Mexico residents have never voted to ban same-sex marriage and state law does not expressly permit or prohibit such unions, said Phil Sisneros, a spokesman for New Mexico Attorney General Gary King.

King, a Democrat, told reporters on Wednesday he would not seek to stop the Do単a Ana county clerk or any other county clerk in the state from issuing same-sex marriage licenses.

In 2004, the county clerk in Sandoval County, New Mexico, began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but stopped doing so after then-Attorney General Patricia Madrid, also a Democrat, issued an interpretation of state law saying gay and lesbian marriage was not legal in New Mexico.

At least two lawsuits by same-sex couples seeking the right to marry are working their way through the New Mexico court system, Sisneros said.

Ellins said he was emboldened to issue same-sex marriage licenses after King in June submitted a friend-of-the-court brief to the New Mexico Supreme Court suggesting the state's long-standing denial of same-sex marriage rights violated the equal protection provisions of the state constitution.

The New Mexico Supreme Court has declined to rule on whether gay marriage is allowed in the state, sending the matter to lower courts, Sisneros said.

The county clerk said he also felt bolstered by a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June that struck down part of the 1996 National Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman and denied benefits to same-sex married couples. "That's a strong signal," Ellins said.

Do単a Ana County, which borders Texas and Mexico, has a population of about 215,000 and its county seat is Las Cruces.

Some same-sex couples who showed up in Las Cruces to obtain marriage licenses came from Texas, where gay marriage is banned, Ellins said.

Maggie Gallagher, an opponent of same-sex marriage and a board member with the American Principles Project, criticized the move by Ellins, saying he should allow the courts to decide whether same-sex marriage should proceed in New Mexico.

"Bypassing that process is lawless and in itself unconstitutional and politically motivated," she said.



headline: Guantanamo guards gave 'Shades of Grey' novel to prisoner, lawyer says
byline: By Jane Sutton
8:31am EDT

Prison guards gave one of the alleged 9/11 conspirators a copy of the erotic novel "Fifty Shades of Grey," according to a defense lawyer who suggested on Wednesday that the unwanted gift was part of a campaign aimed at discrediting his client.

U.S. Representative Jim Moran of Virginia caused a sensation last month when he returned from a visit to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and quoted guards as saying the soft-porn "Grey" novels were the most-requested reading material among the prison's highest-profile inmates.

It was unclear where the books came from since the detainee library doesn't stock the series, a romance trilogy by British author E.L. James that has topped best-seller lists around the world.

Defense attorney James Connell said his client, Ammar al Baluchi, showed up in court with a copy that he said had been given to him by guards on Monday night.

Baluchi had never heard of the book until he read news accounts of Moran's comments and mistakenly thought it was titled "Thirty Shades of Grey," Connell said.

"You'll never believe what the guards gave to me," Connell quoted Baluchi as saying.

Baluchi didn't want the book and gave it to Connell, who said it would stay locked in his safe until he could turn it over to the legal adviser for Camp 7. That maximum-security facility holds about a dozen captives previously held in CIA custody, including Baluchi and four other defendants charged in the 9/11 attacks.

Connell said giving the book to his client was either a practical joke gone too far or "some kind of disinformation campaign."

The congressman's allegations that the defendants preferred the "Grey" novels to the Koran ran counter to the pious image portrayed when they kneel on the courtroom floor to pray at regular intervals.

Detention camp officials had no comment and have repeatedly said they cannot discuss anything related to Camp 7 and those who live there.

But a lawyer for another 9/11 defendant, Ramzi bin al Shibh, said they had commented quickly enough when his client complained about the lunch service and left court on Tuesday afternoon.

A camp spokesman said bin al Shibh had objected to the absence of olives and honey with his meal. Defense lawyer James Harrington called that an attempt to inaccurately portray bin al Shibh as someone who "blew up over very trivial issues."

He also accused camp officials of "trying to paint a picture of our clients that's clearly not accurate."

Baluchi and bin al Shibh are among five prisoners charged with training and funding the 9/11 hijackers. A weeklong pretrial hearing in the death penalty case is scheduled to continue through Friday.



headline: Brother speaks warmly in court of American soldier in Afghan rampage
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

bound Army man before the attacks, his brother testified at a sentencing hearing on Wednesday.

William Bales spoke warmly of his youngest brother, Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, saying the former high school football player left a carefree bachelor life behind to enlist in the military in the aftermath of al Qaeda attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.

"There's no better father that I've seen," William Bales told a jury of six military personnel tasked with determining his fate. "If you brought the kids in there today they would run right to him."

Bales, a decorated veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, has admitted to gunning down the villagers, mostly women and children, in nighttime attacks on their compounds in Kandahar province in March 2012.

He pleaded guilty in June in a deal that will spare him the death penalty. A military jury will decide if he will spend the rest of his life in prison or if he will be eligible for parole after 20 years.

The killings marked the worst case of civilian deaths blamed on a rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.

The defense testimony on Wednesday appeared aimed at telling the story of Bales' transformation from a dutiful young man to a soldier who his civilian defense attorney says broke under the pressure of his final deployment to Afghanistan.

Defense attorneys for Bales have argued that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his deployment to Afghanistan.

"I don't think anybody with a rational mind could say Bob Bales didn't snap," attorney John Henry Browne told reporters after the session. He said Bales would testify later in the proceedings and apologize for his crimes.

IMPACT OF RAMPAGE

The testimony for the defense was in sharp contrast to that of prosecution witnesses earlier in the day in which Afghan civilians - including a man who lost six of his seven children - testified to the impact of the attacks.

Army prosecutors have said Bales acted alone and with chilling premeditation when, armed with a pistol, a rifle and a grenade launcher, he left his base twice during the night, returning in the middle of his rampage to tell a fellow soldier, "I just shot up some people."

Haji Mohammad Wazir said he had been away when the attack occurred. When he got home he saw the bodies of 11 of his relatives, which had been loaded into a vehicle. Among them were his wife, mother, brother and six of his children.

"If someone loses one child, you can imagine how devastated that person would be," said Wazir, estimated to be in his thirties. His surviving 4-year-old son, who was with him at the time of the killings, "misses everyone" and has not forgotten them, he said.

Bales' brigade commander at the time of the slaughter, Colonel Todd Wood, testified that it would take generations before the United States can regain some of the trust lost in the massacre.

Bales, who has claimed his memories of the killings are spotty, acknowledged the killings upon pleading guilty in June and told the court at the time there was "not a good reason in this world" for his actions.

During a nine-day pre-trial hearing last fall, witnesses testified that Bales had been upset by a bomb blast near his outpost that severed a fellow soldier's leg days before the shootings.

Prosecutors have said they hoped to show Bales had engaged in a pattern of bad behavior that predated his multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Another Afghan witness, 41-year-old Mullah Khamal Adin, Wazir's cousin, testified that he arrived at the scene of one of the attacks to find Wazir's mother shot in the head at the entrance of her home. He found the corpses of other family members inside.

"It was such a devastating incident that I don't think I will ever forget it," Khamal Adin said.



headline: Duncan, Oklahoma schools get threats, go on alert after murder of Australian athlete

8:31am EDT

Public schools in Duncan, Oklahoma, were on alert on Wednesday after police received threats against Duncan High School following the arrest of three teenagers in connection with the killing of a university student from Australia.

The school, in a town of 24,000 about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City, was told of the anonymous threats on Tuesday night by police, schools superintendent Sherry Labyer said in a message on the Duncan Public Schools' website. The nature of the threats was not known.

Christopher Lane, 23, of Melbourne, was killed by a gunshot in the back on Friday as he was jogging in Duncan.

Duncan public schools were requiring students to stay on campus until a parent or guardian checked them out, Labyer said. She said children whose parents preferred to keep them home on Wednesday would be excused, Labyer said.

"Please know that we are committed to taking all reasonable action to protect the well-being of our students," said Labyer.

A representative for Duncan High School declined to say if the suspects attended that school, and referred questions to police, who did not immediately return calls for comment.

Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards Jr., 15, have been charged with first degree murder, according to the Stephens County District Attorney's office. Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, has been charged with use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory to murder after the fact, the District Attorney's office said.

All three have been charged as adults, though Jones is considered a youthful offender.

District Attorney Jason Hicks said he intended to pursue adult sentences for all three. In Jones' case that would be 5 years to 45 years for being an accessory after the fact, and 2 years to life for use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon.

"I will be shocked if he is not found to be eligible to be sentenced as an adult," Hicks said of Jones.

off group that didn't seem to care that much."

Cox said the atmosphere "pretty hectic" at his school on Wednesday. "People are either very scared or just not bothered," Cox said. "This is not normal for Duncan ... It's like culture shock."

Lane was jogging during a visit with his girlfriend and her family in Duncan when he was shot, police said. He attended East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma, where he was on a baseball scholarship.

According to police, Jones said the teens decided to kill someone "for the fun of it."

Police said Jones told them on Sunday that the three teenagers saw Lane jogging and decided he would be their target, followed him in their vehicle and then shot him in the back.

If convicted, Luna and Edwards face a possible sentence of life in prison without parole, according to court documents. Under a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, they could not receive the death penalty because of their ages.

The next court hearing for Jones has been scheduled for October 2, and a preliminary hearing for Edwards and Luna has been set for October 16.

life threatening injuries on Wednesday after a bus taking them on a camping trip overturned, authorities said.

The bus veered off a highway and flipped in Wyandotte County, Kansas, said trooper Howard Dickinson of the Kansas Highway Patrol. The bus ended up perpendicular to the road, its rear end in a ditch, television video showed.

The girls from Pembroke Hill, a private school in Kansas City, were on their way to an overnight camp out in rural Kansas, said Elizabeth McKinley Tuttle, spokeswoman for the school. There were 36 girls on the bus, while the boys were on another bus, she said.

Dickinson said a list provided to him by emergency workers on the scene showed 21 girls taken to hospitals. The driver, who has not been charged with any violations, also was transported to a hospital, he said. One teacher was also on the bus, but unhurt, he said.

Other girls on the bus may have suffered various bumps and bruises in the accident, Dickinson said. He did not know the cause of the crash, but said no other vehicles were involved.



headline: Last installment of Nixon's once-secret White House tapes released
byline: By Steve Gorman
8:31am EDT

The U.S. National Archives released on Wednesday its last installment of White House conversations that were secretly recorded by President Richard Nixon in the 1970s, a batch of tapes mainly highlighting domestic and foreign policy issues.

The 340 hours of conversations cover a three-month period from April 9 to July 12, 1973, the day before the existence of Nixon's taping system was revealed by presidential aide Alexander Butterfield in testimony before a U.S. Senate Select Committee investigating the Watergate scandal.

Nixon resigned from office about a year later, in August 1974, facing almost certain impeachment over the involvement of his staff and campaign team in an attempt to bug his Democratic opponents' offices at the Watergate complex and their efforts to cover it up.

By then, the White House taping system, installed by Nixon in 1971, had been dismantled, apparently on the orders of either Nixon himself or his then-chief of staff, Alexander Haig.

But never-before-heard material from the latest batch of 94 tapes made available through the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, administered by the National Archives in Nixon's birthplace of Yorba Linda, California, deals mostly with subjects other than Watergate.

They include conversations related to such Cold War-era events as the Vietnam peace settlement and the return of prisoners of war, as well as the aftermath of the 1972 superpower summit between Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, the library said in a statement.

The voice-activated system also captured the 1973 Oval Office meeting between Nixon and Brezhnev, the only summit-level meeting ever recorded by a U.S. presidential taping network.

Among the range of domestic-policy subjects are conversations about wage and price controls, energy policy, campaign finance reform and the Native American uprising at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.

Archive officials say that any newly disclosed mentions of Watergate are confined to conversations deemed not to involve government abuses of power, such as discussions of press coverage of the scandal and how it was affecting White House scheduling.

The bulk of Watergate material, including tapes used as evidence in various Watergate-related trials or by special investigators with the prosecutor's office, was released in four previous batches between May 1980 and November 1996, according to the National Archives.

The non-Watergate material has been made available to the public after years of litigation, under a settlement among the National Archives, Nixon's estate and Stanley Kutler, a historian who sued to win release of the tapes.

Nixon's taping system, known only to a few aides before it was disclosed, extended not only to the Oval Office but also to the White House Cabinet Room, the Lincoln Sitting Room in the mansion's living quarters, Nixon's office at the Executive Office Building next door and the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland.

Nixon was not the first president to secretly record his White House conversations. A certain amount of taping was done by each of his predecessors going back to Franklin Roosevelt.



headline: Family of California kidnapper may seek DNA tests on children
byline: By Dan Whitcomb and Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

old girl after killing her mother and younger brother want more answers from police and has considered seeking DNA tests to determine if he is the children's biological father, a family spokesman said on Wednesday.

old Ethan Anderson, and set fire to his rural San Diego area home, Andrew Spanswick told Reuters in an interview.

DiMaggio, 40, was discovered with 16-year-old Hannah Anderson days later at a mountain lake in the remote Idaho wilderness and shot to death by an FBI agent during an operation to rescue the girl.

Police have described DiMaggio, 40, as a longtime friend of Christina Anderson who was treated like an uncle to her children Hannah and Ethan. Spanswick was a friend of both DiMaggio and his sister, Lora Robinson, and has acted as a spokesman for the DiMaggio family.

"Lora is in a position of extreme grief and distress and she's looking for any sort explanation of how her brother could have changed from the person she knew into what he is accused of," Spanswick said of DiMaggio's sister.

Spanswick said members of DiMaggio's family had not made a formal request for DNA from Hannah or Ethan Anderson, but have raised the issue as they seek a fuller understanding of the events leading up to the murders and kidnapping.

"Nobody is sure of anything," he said. "So we have DNA samples from Jim. Lora at this point is just looking for a possible motive why, after taking care of these children for so long, would he do these horrible acts."

A San Diego County Sheriff's spokesman, Jan Caldwell, said on Wednesday that no requests had been made to the department for DNA from Ethan Anderson. Representatives of the Anderson family could not immediately be reached for comment.

DIMAGGIO, HANNAH PHOTOGRAPHED IN CAR

Caldwell said that sheriff's investigators had confirmed that DiMaggio and Hannah Anderson were photographed in his car at 12:10 a.m. on August 4, some 20 hours before the house went up in flames.

Christina and Ethan Anderson were last seen alive on August 3 at their home in the San Diego community of Lakeside, and Hannah Anderson was picked up from a high school cheerleading event at Sweetwater High School in nearby National City that afternoon.

The remains of Christina Anderson were found under a tarp in DiMaggio's log-cabin-style home in Boulevard, about 25 miles east of San Diego, and an autopsy found that she died from blunt force trauma to the head.

The badly burned body of Ethan Anderson was found in a different part of the wreckage than his mother. Authorities have not yet released a cause of death for the boy.

Spanswick said family members would like to see the still or video images taken of DiMaggio and Hannah Anderson at the Border Patrol checkpoint, hoping it would shed light on a confusing situation.

Authorities have not publicly discussed any possible motives for DiMaggio's actions. A family friend has said the suspect developed an apparent infatuation with the high school girl that made Hannah feel uncomfortable.

Caldwell said the police investigation was winding down and that no new details will be released by the department.

"We have concluded our investigation and we will not be making any further comment," Caldwell said.



headline: Firefighters turn corner against blaze menacing Idaho ski resort
byline: By Laura Zuckerman

class Idaho ski resort of Sun Valley appeared to turn a corner against the massive blaze on Wednesday, helped by cooler weather and more humidity in the air.

Containment of a blaze that has menaced multimillion-dollar houses and pumped thick smoke into a mountain valley known for its scenic views rose to 30 percent on Wednesday from 9 percent the day before.

The so-called Beaver Creek fire has destroyed one home and seven other buildings and forced the evacuation of thousands of area residents since it was sparked by lightning two weeks ago.

"We are cautiously optimistic. But we still have respect for the fire and realize things could change," said fire information officer Shawna Hartman.

Fire officials said if weather conditions like higher humidity levels and lower temperatures kept favoring firefighting efforts, the blaze could be contained by as much as 50 percent by the end of the week.

The fire is among dozens of wildfires burning across Western states that have strained U.S. Forest Service resources at a time when federal budget cuts known as sequestration reduced by 500 the number of the agency's seasonal firefighters, Forest Service officials said.

The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise raised to the maximum level on Tuesday an index that weighs the heightened demand for fire crews and equipment like helicopters against the limited supply available during large Western fires in such states as Idaho, Oregon and Utah.

The Idaho blaze near Sun Valley has charred 108,000 acres of sagebrush, shrub lands and pine and spruce forests in the Sawtooth Mountains west of Sun Valley and two other nearby tourist towns that make up a resort region in central Idaho where land and properties are valued at $8 billion.



headline: Bankruptcy judge considers opening secret Detroit 'data room'
byline: By Bernie Woodall and Joseph Lichterman
8:31am EDT

The city of Detroit may have to publicly disclose at least some of the financial information in its digital vault, which includes what the city's fiscal future could look like.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes on Wednesday accepted an offer by Jones Day, the law firm handling the city's July 18 municipal bankruptcy filing, to go through about 7,000 pages of financial information in a digital "data room" in the next few days and identify which documents could be made public.

Rhodes said he will entertain the city's argument to keep some of the data out of the public eye on August 28.

The city, under state-appointed Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr, set up and provided the content for the password-protected data room and allowed access to creditors involved in the historic Detroit bankruptcy filing only if they signed a nondisclosure agreement.

Creditors and Orr's office have not revealed what the data consists of. While it was not intended to be seen by the public, representatives from the city's unions and pension funds as well as corporate creditors have been given the password to it after agreeing to the nondisclosure agreement.

On Wednesday afternoon, Jones Day attorney Gregory Shumaker made the offer to identify documents that should be kept from the public, in a change from insisting that all of them should remain private.

Orr is a former member of Jones Day. He resigned from the firm to take the emergency manager position five months ago.

At a hearing earlier on Wednesday at the federal courthouse in Detroit, Rhodes seemed to take umbrage when Shumaker said some of the financial information in the so-called room was not relevant to the city's Chapter 9 filing.

"This is bankruptcy. What is not relevant?" said Rhodes.

Shumaker seemed taken aback. There are scenarios of what may happen to the city's finances in the future that are best kept private, he said.

"What would be the harm to the city's interest?" countered Rhodes.

In the afternoon session, Shumaker said some personal information of individual pensioners should be kept confidential. He also said that as part of an agreement with the actuarial firm Milliman, which drew up some scenarios for the city's two pension funds, the company insisted that anyone viewing the information sign a nondisclosure agreement.

Rhodes told Shumaker to make sure Milliman representatives were in the court next week to explain why their actuarial research should remain out of the public's view.

On July 10, eight days before Detroit filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, a United Auto Workers attorney, Michael Nicholson, refused to sign the nondisclosure agreement that covered the data as well as discussions held that day in a meeting with Jones Day representatives regarding the city's pensioners.

Nicholson told Rhodes in court Wednesday morning that he was pleased to see a hearing had been set on the potential public release of the information.

Wednesday's hearing had been requested by Syncora Guarantee, the bond insurer that is contesting a creditor agreement Detroit is asking the court to approve. That agreement involves interest-rate swaps related to Detroit pension debt for which Syncora guarantees payment.

Detroit sued Syncora in July after it allegedly told U.S. Bank, which controls the flow of casino funds that were part of a previous agreement with the swap counterparties, not to release up to $11 million a month to Detroit. The hearing did not result in any resolution to the dispute.

Questions regarding information in the data room by Syncora's attorney, Stephen Hackney, led to Rhodes' questioning why the information should be kept confidential.



headline: U.S. soldier Manning gets 35 years for passing documents to WikiLeaks
byline: By Ian Simpson and Medina Roshan
8:31am EDT

U.S. soldier Bradley Manning was sentenced on Wednesday to 35 years in a military prison for turning over more than 700,000 classified files to WikiLeaks in the biggest breach of secret data in the nation's history.

The 25-year-old former low-level intelligence analyst, in uniform, stood quietly and showed no emotion as Judge Colonel Denise Lind sentenced him to less time behind bars than the 60 years sought by military prosecutors.

Military parole rules could allow Manning to be out of prison in seven years, his lawyer said, a fact WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange called a "tactical victory" for the defense.

But transparency activists said the sentence would still have a chilling effect on prospective leakers. The sentence, which comes at a time when the Obama administration is aggressively investigating leaks, would be the heaviest ever served for turning over secrets to the media, experts said.

Onlookers in the Fort Meade, Maryland, military courtroom gasped as Lind read Manning's sentence. The soldier's aunt, Debra Van Alstyne, closed her eyes and appeared to be holding back tears. Supporters shouted: "Bradley, we are with you."

Defense attorney David Coombs admitted to weeping upon hearing the news and said his client tried to soothe him.

"Myself and others were in tears. He looks to me and he says 'It's OK. It's all right,'" Coombs told reporters after the hearing, adding that Manning told him, "'I'm going to be OK. I'm going to get through this' ... I'm in a position where my client is cheering me up. He is a resilient young man."

Coombs said he would file paperwork asking President Barack Obama to pardon Manning, who will serve his sentence in the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Manning will be dishonorably discharged from the U.S. military, Lind said. She reduced his sentence by the three years he has served in prison, plus the 112 days she had already decided to subtract because of the harsh treatment the soldier suffered after his arrest three years ago.

TROUBLED YOUNG MAN

Manning was working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2010 when he gave WikiLeaks a trove of diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts that included a 2007 gunsight video of a U.S. Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff.

During the trial, defense lawyers said Manning had hoped the document release would open Americans' eyes to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and provoke a more intense debate. Prosecutors contended that the soldier placed national security at risk by revealing confidential information.

Manning said in a statement read by his attorney that he chose to release the files out of moral concerns.

"I started to question the morality of what we were doing," he said. "We had forgotten our humanity."

Prosecutors declined to comment after the sentence was read.

WikiLeaks' Assange applauded Manning's defense but decried the trial and verdict.

"While the defense should be proud of their tactical victory, it should be remembered that Mr. Manning's trial and conviction is an affront to basic concepts of Western justice," Assange said in a statement published at WikiLeaks.org.

Manning's attorneys portrayed their client as a troubled young man, who questioned his sexual identity and showed signs of anger management issues that included punching a fellow soldier and grabbing for a gun during a counseling session. Those actions, they argued, were signs Manning was unfit for war-zone deployment.

HEAVY SENTENCE

"The government is looking for general deterrence of future Bradley Mannings," said Jeffrey Walker, an expert on military law and professor at St. John's University. "Thirty-five years is a pretty powerful message. I think they could have sent it with less than 35 years."

Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the sentence was in line with sentences for paid espionage for the enemy.

In 2005, Defense Department employee Lawrence Franklin pleaded guilty to passing classified data on Iran to two pro-Israel lobbyists. He received a prison sentence of 12 years, which a judge later cut to 10 months in a halfway house.

Americans convicted of passing secrets to foreign governments have faced stiffer sentences. Former FBI agent Robert Hanssen was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty in 2001 to spying for Russia and the Soviet Union.

Other observers agreed the sentence would be a powerful deterrent and in future help to protect national security.

"The message will be sent in a loud and clear fashion to all those in uniform that they do not get to make decisions on what is legitimate and what is not, with regard to U.S. policy," said Steven Bucci, a foreign policy specialist at the Heritage Foundation.

The Manning court-martial highlights the difficulty of keeping secrets in the Internet age. It comes at a time when U.S. security agencies, with a large number of analysts granted access to secret files, are under great pressure to piece together disparate intelligence threads to head off attacks such as the April bombings at the Boston Marathon.

At the same time, the U.S. government is seeking the return of former CIA contractor Edward Snowden, who in June leaked details of secret U.S. programs to monitor the phone and Internet traffic of Americans. He has been granted temporary asylum by Russian authorities.

old Atlanta boy received a new heart on Tuesday evening, just 10 days after his family complained he was unfairly rejected for a transplant because of past failure to take medicine and show up for doctors' appointments, local media reported.

Anthony Stokes, who has a weakened, enlarged heart that cannot pump blood efficiently, could have less than six months to live without a transplant, his family said last week. A few days later, the hospital reversed course and added him to its waiting list.

Stokes received a heart transplant Tuesday, a family spokesman told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He was in the intensive care unit of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Wednesday, the hospital said.

Citing patient privacy, the hospital would not release further details of the case but said it has performed 10 heart transplants so far this year, three in the past week.

Double Stuf Oreos were found to be a little on the light side in a weight test conducted by high school seniors in upstate New York, as part of a consumer math class exercise, their teacher said on Wednesday.

"They found out the Double Stuf was 1.86 times the original," said Dan Anderson, who teaches the group at Queensbury High School in Queensbury, New York. And those Mega Stuf cookies? Only 2.68 the original, they found.

The students set out to measure the cookies after Mega Stuf Oreos were introduced in February. "Was it triple, quadruple, five times the stuffing?" Anderson said. "We also decided to measure how much the Double Stuf was."

Some students measured the height of the Double Stuf Oreos and found it close to double, although the cookies varied so much it was difficult to tell, Anderson said.

Others tried to measure the volume but that proved too difficult, he said.

The successful method proved to be measuring the cookies' weight. Students weighed 10 of each cookie type, then subtracted the weight of the wafers, he said.

The original Oreos were introduced by the National Biscuit Company in 1912. They are now made by the Nabisco division of Mondelez International, which stands by its cookies, said Mondelez spokeswoman Kimberly Fontes.

"While I'm not familiar with what was done in the classroom setting, I can confirm for you that our recipe for the Oreo Double Stuf Cookie has double the Stuf, or creme filling, when compared with our base, or original Oreo cookie," Fontes said.

Public schools in Duncan, Oklahoma, are on heightened security alert on Wednesday, one day after charges were filed against three teenagers in what police said may have been the thrill killing of an Australian university student.

Duncan High School, located in a town of 24,000 about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City, was informed by police of anonymous threats on Tuesday night, according to schools superintendent Sherry Labyer in a message posted on the schools' website.

In a case that has gained international attention, Christopher Lane, 23, of Melbourne, was killed by a gunshot in the back on Friday as he was jogging in Duncan.

All Duncan public schools on Wednesday will have increased security, and all campuses will require students to stay on campus until a parent or guardian checks them out, Labyer said. If any parents prefer to keep their children at home Wednesday, absences for this reason will be excused, Labyer said.

"Please know that we are committed to taking all reasonable action to protect the well-being of our students," said Labyer.

A representative for Duncan High School declined to say if the three suspects attended that school, referring questions to police.

Charged with first-degree murder are Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards Jr., 15, according to the Stephens County District Attorney's office. Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, who allegedly drove the vehicle carrying the other suspects, was charged with use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory to murder after the fact, the office said.

Lane was out jogging during a visit to his girlfriend and her family in Duncan when he was shot, police said. He attended East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma, where he was on a baseball scholarship.

According to police, Jones said the teens decided to kill someone "for the fun of it."

Police said Jones told them on Sunday that the three teenagers saw Lane jogging and decided he would be their target, followed him in their vehicle and then shot him in the back.

If convicted, Luna and Edwards face a possible sentence of life in prison without parole, according to court documents. Under a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, they cannot receive the death penalty because they were under 18 at the time of the alleged crime.



headline: Britain defends detention of journalist's partner

8:31am EDT

The British government, accused of abusing media freedom, said on Tuesday police were right to detain a journalist's partner if they thought lives might be at risk from data he was carrying from fugitive U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.

Facing legal and diplomatic complaints after police held Guardian writer Glenn Greenwald's Brazilian partner for nine hours on Sunday - and accused by the newspaper of forcing it to trash computers holding copies of Snowden's data - the interior minister said officers were entitled to take security measures.

Home Secretary Theresa May said police held David Miranda at a London airport under anti-terrorism powers, which allow for action to prevent stolen data to aid terrorists. Material from Snowden, published by the Guardian, has revealed extensive U.S. and British surveillance of global communications networks.

"It's absolutely right that if the police believe that somebody is in possession of highly sensitive, stolen information that could help terrorists, that could risk lives, lead to a potential loss of life, the police are able to act - and that's what the law enables them to do," May told the BBC.

She added, however, that an independent reviewer was looking into the police conduct.

As interior minister, May said she was briefed in advance that Miranda might be stopped but added that she did not decide who the police detained. The United States said Britain gave it a "heads up" but it did not ask for Miranda to be questioned.

Snowden, who faces criminal charges in the United States, has been granted a year's asylum by Russia.

A British lawyer who launched an action on Miranda's behalf to question the legal basis of his detention said police seized a laptop computer, a telephone, memory sticks, a computer hard drive and a games console from him. He was released without charge after reaching a time limit on such detentions.

Miranda had been in transit at Heathrow airport, carrying material from Snowden that was being passed from Berlin-based American documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras to Greenwald, an American writer for Britain's Guardian who lives in Rio de Janeiro.

"These items contain sensitive, confidential journalistic material and should not have been seized," Miranda's London lawyers wrote in a letter to May and the police.

In an interview with CNN along with Greenwald, Miranda said the officers who questioned him told him he could be jailed if he did not answer everything they asked. Even though he was detained under an anti-terrorism law, he said: "No, they didn't ask me anything about terrorism - not one question about it."

Brazil's government has complained to Britain. The action against Miranda also was denounced by British opposition politicians, human rights lawyers and press freedom groups.

The leaks by Snowden, a former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, disclosed details of NSA and British surveillance of public telephone and internet traffic. The United States and Britain say their agencies acted within their laws and the leaks threatened their national security.

'YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN'

On Tuesday, Guardian editors revealed how and why the newspaper destroyed computer hard drives containing copies of some of the secret files leaked by Snowden.

A timeline of events provided by the Guardian said initial British attempts to stop reporting on the files came two weeks after the newspaper published its first three stories based on Snowden's leaks.

These stories were about a secret U.S. court order obliging communications company Verizon to hand over data on customers' phone usage, Britain's secretive Government Communications Headquarters' (GCHQ) use of data from an NSA internet monitoring program, and British intelligence spying on allies in London.

Shortly afterward, two senior British officials arrived to see editor Alan Rusbridger to demand the newspaper hand over all its Snowden files, arguing the material was stolen, according to the Guardian's timeline. He refused.

Three weeks later, in July, after the publication of more articles, officials got back in touch with Rusbridger and told him, according to the newspaper: "You've had your fun. Now we want the stuff back."

The officials expressed fears that foreign governments, particularly Russia or China, could hack into the newspaper's IT network although the journalists stressed the documents were not stored on any Guardian system but held in isolation, according to the newspaper.

Between July 16 and 19, the Guardian said government pressure intensified and there was an explicit threat of legal action if the newspaper did not comply.

Rusbridger said he decided if the government was determined to stop Britain-based reporting on the Snowden files, the best option was to destroy the London copy and to edit and report from the same material held in the United States and Brazil.

On July 20, two "security experts" from GCHQ visited the paper's London head office and watched as deputy editor Paul Johnson, executive director Sheila Fitzsimons and a newspaper computer expert used angle grinders and other tools to pulverize hard drives and memory chips storing encrypted files, according to the newspaper. Both sides knew other copies existed outside the Britain.

"I hope what (the Miranda detention controversy) will do is to send people back to read the stories that so upset the British state because there has been a lot of reporting about what GCHQ and the NSA are up to," Rusbridger said.

In Washington, White House spokesman John Earnest said he could not comment on the destruction of some of the Guardian's Snowden material. But he said he could not see U.S. authorities destroying an American media company's hard drives to protect national security.

"That's very difficult to imagine a scenario in which that would be appropriate," Earnest told reporters.

Greenwald told CNN he felt emboldened by Britain's actions.

"It's not going to stop our reporting. It doesn't do them any good. All it did ... is give them a huge black eye in the world, make them look thuggish and authoritarian, interfering in the journalism process" while creating an international incident with the government of Brazil, Greenwald added.

"Journalism is not a crime and it is not terrorism," he said. He also criticized the United States for having received a "heads up" about Miranda being questioned but doing nothing to discourage it or protect the rights of a free press.

Shanghai flight, causing the pilot to divert to Anchorage, Alaska, was charged on Tuesday with interfering with flight crew members and attendants.

The Sunday flight, operated by Delta Air Lines Inc, stopped in Alaska's biggest city, where officers arrested Stephanie Heizman Auerbach, a Shanghai-based designer and owner of an apparel and fashion company, according to court documents.

An affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Anchorage said Auerbach's disruptive behavior began 60 to 90 minutes into the flight, when she began talking loudly, making gestures, walking up and down the aisle and climbing over seats.

She "screamed profanities" at flight attendants and five times refused to heed instructions to return to her assigned seat, according to the affidavit, filed by Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Benjamin Hallowell.

Flight attendants had served her five glasses of white wine, and passengers said she took additional alcoholic beverages from the galley without the knowledge of flight crew members, according to the affidavit.

The plane's captain "determined that it was not safe to continue the flight" with Auerbach aboard and diverted to Anchorage, the affidavit said.

Two children traveling with Auerbach were allowed to remain on the flight because they were being met in Shanghai by their father, according to the affidavit.

Auerbach's LinkedIn profile describes her as a designer and owner of an apparel and fashion company in Shanghai, Stephanie &amp; Co.

Auerbach remained in custody late Tuesday at Anchorage's Hiland Mountain Correctional Center, a spokeswoman said. She surrendered her passport on Tuesday, according to court records.

Her Anchorage attorney was not immediately available for comment late Tuesday.



headline: Death penalty debate a sleepy affair in slow-moving Guantanamo court
byline: By Jane Sutton
8:31am EDT

conspirators in the September 11 plot were properly sent to trial as a death penalty case.

The issue is literally a matter of life and death, but the legal debate has inched along over several pretrial hearings at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base, rendering it torpid.

Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the hijacked plane plot, was awakened before 5 a.m. for the trip from his cell to the top-security courtroom. Wearing a camouflage jacket over his white tunic, he rested his head in his hands at one point during the hearing and appeared to nod off for a moment, then seemed to jolt awake and resumed reading along with the legal documents.

Defense attorneys asked the judge in April 2012 to drop the charges, arguing that the Pentagon appointee overseeing the tribunal had rushed to refer it for trial as a death penalty case without giving them a chance to present potentially mitigating evidence. That mainly involves allegations that the defendants were tortured during CIA interrogations.

Eighteen months later, the request is not yet ripe for a ruling. The issue before the judge on Wednesday was whether to compel testimony from two legal advisers involved in the decision.

Navy Commander Walter Ruiz, who represents Saudi defendant Mustafa al Hawsawi, said the appointee who signed off on the death penalty decision, retired Vice Admiral Bruce MacDonald, was an "absentee landlord" who spent most of his time at his home in the Seattle area and left his Washington D.C. office in the hands of the two legal advisers.

The defendants have been in U.S. custody since 2002 and 2003 and face charges that include conspiring with al Qaeda, terrorism and murder. They are accused of training and funding the hijackers who rammed four commercial jets into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania in 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people.

Prosecutors hope to start the trial in September 2014. Defense lawyers say it could take them years longer to prepare. As the hearings drag on, prosecutors regularly accuse the defense of stalling, and the defense lawyers accuse the prosecutors of ignoring requests for evidence.

The judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, seemed exasperated on Wednesday when a prosecutor said he actually had some documents that Ruiz sought to obtain but had not turned them over because he considered them irrelevant.

"Why don't you just hand them to Commander Ruiz? Why are wasting time on this?" the judge said. "That may be a better use of our time than sitting here discussing this for 15 or 20 minutes."

headline: Marches, events to mark anniversary of King's 'dream' speech
byline: By Ian Simpson
8:31am EDT

ringing are set to mark the 50th anniversary this month of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr's "I have a dream" speech, a key event in the struggle of African Americans for racial equality.

The week of commemorations in Washington will culminate on August 28, when President Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, will speak at the Lincoln Memorial 50 years to the day after King made his historic address at the site.

King, an advocate of non-violence, was among six organizers of the 1963 March on Washington, a rally for jobs and freedom. King led about 250,000 marchers to the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall and delivered his signature "I have a dream" speech from its steps.

The March on Washington helped pressure Congress to pass the landmark Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts in 1964 and 1965, respectively. The Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in June, and Obama has called that ruling a setback.

King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. A white drifter assassinated him in 1968 at age 39.

A MARCH ON SATURDAY

Events in Washington will kick off on Wednesday with a commemorative service at Mount Airy Baptist Church. Seminars on women and young people in the civil rights movement and on March on Washington figures Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph will take place in the following days.

Civil rights groups the National Urban League and King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) will also be holding events in Washington. The SCLC's international convention on Friday will feature debates on race and poverty and on voting rights.

The U.S. Postal Service will unveil a commemorative stamp on Friday, and a Sunday gospel brunch with opera singer Denyce Graves is tap. The National Park Service has scheduled numerous civil rights-related events on the National Mall.

The Smithsonian Institution has an exhibition at the National Museum of American History commemorating the 1963 march and the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln, complete with Lincoln's stovepipe hat.

The Smithsonian is holding a concert and a mock training session for participants in a desegregation sit-in, and is releasing a playlist of music from the civil rights movement. The National Portrait Gallery also has a show on King and his life.

The Newseum, a museum dedicated to U.S. media, started exhibits this month highlighting the role of students in the civil rights movement. They include a section of retailer F.W. Woolworth's lunch counter where North Carolina students started sit-ins in 1960.

On Saturday, some 100,000 people are expected at a march on Washington's National Mall organized by civil rights leader and TV commentator Al Sharpton and by King's oldest son. The "National Action to Realize the Dream" will group unions, civil rights and Hispanic groups and Democratic political leaders.

The march is focused on a host of issues, including jobs, voting rights, gun violence, women's rights and immigration. Speakers include the family of Trayvon Martin, the black Florida teenager shot dead by a volunteer watchman, and Georgia Democratic Representative John Lewis, the last surviving organizer of the 1963 march.

The "Let Freedom Ring" ceremony at which Obama will speak on August 28 will include speeches by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, both Southern Democrats. The commemoration will include the ringing of bells at dozens of U.S. sites at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), the time when King delivered his address.

Outside the United States, bell-ringing is also scheduled at sites including Katmandu, London and Tokyo, all at 3 p.m. local time, according to Atlanta's King Center, which is among the organizers of many of the commemorative events.



headline: Pilot in Connecticut crash was in contact with airport - report
byline: By Richard Weizel
8:31am EDT

The pilot of a small plane that crashed into two Connecticut homes this month, killing him, his son and two children, told airport personnel just before the crash he had "visual contact" with the airport and was preparing to land, according to a preliminary report released on Tuesday.

The pilot, Bill Henningsgaard, and his 17-year-old son, Maxwell, were on a trip to visit colleges when the plane crashed August 9 into a Connecticut neighborhood as it approached Tweed-New Haven Airport.

The two other victims, 13-year-old Sadie Brantley and her one-year-old sister Madisyn Mitchell, were inside one of the houses at the time of the crash. The mother of the two girls, Joann Mitchell, was home at the time but was not injured.

The report by the National Transportation Safety Board said there were gusty winds of up to 22 mph and limited visibility at the time of the crash.

"It's just far too early to know what caused this crash and often it is a combination of factors. It may take up to a year to make that determination," said NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson.

Less than two minutes before the twin-engined propeller plane struck the homes, Henningsgaard, a retired Microsoft executive, told the air control tower he could see the runway and was preparing to land, the report said.

The plane, which had taken off from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, was less than a mile from the runway at 11:20 a.m. when it suddenly became inverted, according to the report.

The report cites an interview with a student pilot who was driving eastbound nearby on Interstate 95.

"The airplane was inverted and traveling at a high rate of speed, nose first, towards the ground in the vicinity of where (the airport) was located," the witness, who was not named, was quoted as saying.



headline: Photographer found guilty of four California serial murders
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

degree murder in the serial slayings of four northern California prostitutes dating to the 1970s.

Joseph Naso, 79, now faces the possibility of the death penalty for the "Alphabet murders," so called because of the matching letters of the first and last names of each of his victims.

Naso also remains a suspect in the killing of at least two other California women whose cases could have a bearing on his sentencing, and authorities believe he may have slain four more.

According to prosecutors, Naso drugged his victims, sexually assaulted and strangled them before dumping their bodies in remote places.

Investigators found pictures of two of the women he was convicted of killing in Naso's safe-deposit box and notes about all four of the victims on a list prosecutors described as a roster of dumping grounds.

The balding, stooped-shouldered Naso insisted on defending himself at his two-month trial, during which he admitted taking pictures of women in nylons and high heels and boastfully displayed some of those photos in court while maintaining he never killed anyone.

After weeks of testimony from roughly 70 prosecution witnesses, Naso called only a handful of individuals to the stand, including a woman who once posed for him as a model and an artist whom he asked to vouch for his work.

Naso himself declined to testify and told the jury he wanted to explain why although the judge would not allow him to offer a reason.

The jury of six men and six women began weighing the evidence on Monday and deliberated less than six hours before returning their guilty verdict on Tuesday afternoon.

Naso showed no visible emotion as the verdict was read. He sat stone-faced at the defense table, staring down but casting occasional glances at the jury. He later asked for a mistrial, saying the jurors had been inattentive during the trial.

"I think they were kind of sitting through this thing, waiting until it was over," he said. "I think they just relied on the decision of the foreperson."

Marin County Superior Court Judge Andrew Sweet denied Naso's mistrial motion and ordered him to remain held without bail.

'INVENTED PARANOIA'

"What you've expressed to me, Mr. Naso, I think it's an invented paranoia about what happened in the jury room," the judge said. "The jurors seemed fully engaged throughout the entire proceeding."

Sweet scheduled a motions hearing for later this month and ordered jurors to return on September 4 for the start of the sentencing phase of the trial.

Prosecutors have said they would seek to admit evidence in the penalty phase from two additional slayings for which Naso has been suspected but never charged.

Investigators began to tie him to the California slayings in 2010 after law enforcement officers visiting his Nevada home while he was on probation for an unrelated felony theft conviction found ammunition there.

A further search of the Reno house turned up what prosecutors have described as diaries of sexual assaults, a list of 10 victim dumping grounds and hundreds of photographs of scantily clad women, many appearing dead or unconscious.

During the trial, Naso insisted that prosecutors lacked any physical proof that he killed the four women he was charged with murdering. However, he conceded that DNA found in the pantyhose worn by one of the women, Roxene Roggasch, might justify the conclusion that he had sex with her.

Roggasch, 18, and Carmen Colon, 22, were slain in the 1970s. Two other victims, Pamela Parsons, 38, and Tracy Tafoya, 31, were killed in the 1990s.

Roggasch's older brother, Larry, the only relative of the victims to attend the trial, said of the verdict: "It's been a long time coming."

"I was hoping it would feel a lot better. Right now, it don't. It won't until he's dead and gone," he said of Naso.

An investigation is continuing into the fate of six other women included in what authorities call Naso's "list of 10."

Prosecutors have linked Naso to the disappearance of two of the six, including Renee Shapiro, a Bob Dylan fan who went by the name of the musician's former wife, Sara Dylan, and vanished in 1992. Her skull was found in 1998 but only identified as Shapiro's earlier this year.

Investigators said they found Shapiro's driver's license and passport in Naso's safe-deposit box, as well as newspaper articles about two of the murders of which he was convicted. The second suspected victim lived in a building in San Francisco that Naso once managed. Her body washed ashore in Marin County some years ago.



headline: Autopsy finds drugs in journalist who died in Los Angeles crash
byline: By Alex Dobuzinskis
8:31am EDT

A prominent U.S. journalist whose reporting led to the ouster of the senior U.S. military commander in Afghanistan had traces of methamphetamine in his blood when he was killed in June in a fiery Los Angeles car crash, autopsy findings showed on Tuesday.

The drugs in Michael Hastings' system were of an amount unlikely to have contributed to the crash in which the Mercedes-Benz he was driving struck a tree and burst into flames, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office report.

A Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman said at the time that "there was no evidence of foul play in the accident," but the news stirred Internet conspiracy theories suggesting the journalist had been the victim of government efforts to silence him.

Hastings, 33, was best known for a 2010 Rolling Stone profile of Army General Stanley McChrystal that quoted the military leader making disparaging remarks about President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.

Obama soon relieved McChrystal of his post and replaced him with then-General David Petraeus.

The autopsy found Hastings died of traumatic injuries from a car collision with a fixed object and that he succumbed to his injuries within seconds of impact.

Toxicology results showed a small amount of amphetamine in Hastings' blood consistent with "possible intake of methamphetamine many hours before death" but which would probably not have been "intoxicative" at the time of the crash.

Hastings also had marijuana in his system in the form of its metabolite, indicating possible pot use hours before his death. "Family had just arrived from New York the day prior, attempting to get decedent to go to rehab," the report said.

It also cited the initial Los Angeles police investigation as having found that Hastings had been traveling at a "high rate of speed" when he "apparently lost control of his vehicle."

Hastings' widow, Elise Jordan, in an interview with CNN host Piers Morgan earlier this month, downplayed the conspiracy theories.

"The LAPD still has an active investigation," Jordan told CNN. "I don't really have anything to add. My gut here is that it was just a really tragic accident, and I'm very unlucky and the world was very unlucky."

A June Twitter posting from anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks said the journalist contacted a WikiLeaks attorney hours before his death to tell them the FBI was investigating him. The post fueled online speculation about the nature of his death.

The FBI in a statement in June said "at no time" was Hastings under investigation by the agency.



headline: Three Oklahoma boys charged in killing of Australian student
byline: By Heide Brandes

Three teenage boys were charged on Tuesday in the killing of an Australian university student in Oklahoma, in what police said might have been a thrill killing.

Christopher Lane, 23, of Melbourne, was found dead of a gunshot wound on Friday, according to police in Duncan, Oklahoma, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City.

Charged with first-degree murder are Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards Jr., 15, according to the Stephens County District Attorney's office. Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, who allegedly drove the vehicle carrying the other suspects, was charged with use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory to murder after the fact, the office said.

Lane was out jogging during a visit to his girlfriend and her family in Duncan on Friday, when he was shot in the back, police said. He attended East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma, where he was on a baseball scholarship.

According to police, Jones said that the teens decided to kill someone "for the fun of it."

Police said a witness called 911 when she saw Lane stagger across the road and fall.

According to police, Jones told them on Sunday that the three teenagers saw Lane jogging and decided he would be their target, and then followed him in their vehicle and shot Lane in the back.

Police used surveillance video from area businesses to identify the vehicle, which was found later at a church parking lot with the three suspects inside after a caller reported three youths with guns who were threatening to kill someone.

The vehicle's trunk contained a shotgun with the serial numbers sanded off, but the actual weapon used in the shooting has not been found, police said.

If convicted, Luna and Edwards face a possible sentence of life in prison without parole, according to court documents. Under a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, they cannot receive the death penalty because they were under 18 at the time of the alleged crime, according to David Slane, an Oklahoma City criminal defense attorney.

Lane's father, Peter Lane, called the killing "senseless" in an interview broadcast on CNN from Australia.

"There's not going to be any good coming out of this because it was so senseless," Lane said. "It happened, it's wrong and we're just trying to deal with it the best we can."

Duncan, the county seat of Stephens County, has a population of 23,287, according to the 2012 U.S. Census estimate.

In an interview on CNN television, Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said the usually quiet "community is outraged. The community has some fear." Ford said. "I think they have some of the same questions that maybe folks in Australia have, and that's about how do these kids get guns. It's pretty simple, they steal them."

In a statement, ECU baseball coach Dino Rosato said Lane was a well-respected teammate.

"He was an absolute joy to coach," said Rosato. "He set a great example for all of his teammates, but more importantly for the younger players. He was a mature student-athlete who his teammates could look to for advice and support."

47 inside an elementary school in the Atlanta suburbs, forcing the evacuation of 800 students who were all reunited with their parents without injury, officials said.

Authorities have not identified the suspect, but believe he gained access to the school in Decatur, Georgia, by slipping in behind someone who had access to the building's locked doors, said DeKalb County Police Department spokeswoman Mekka Parish.

The shooting comes less than a year after a heavily armed gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, killing 20 children and six adults. The rampage reignited debate over gun control in America.

In Georgia, after the gunman made his way into the school, an office worker called an Atlanta television station, and said the suspect was demanding to talk to the station. She said the gunman wanted the station to send a crew to "start filming as police died," the station reported.

When police officers arrived at the school, the suspect started shooting at them and the officers returned fire, said DeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander.

Television footage showed students being evacuated from the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy and crowding in a field behind the building before they were taken to a nearby Walmart store parking lot.

The school has an enrollment of more than 800 students from pre-kindergarten to fifth grade, according to the website of the DeKalb County school system.

The school is named after an African-American NASA astronaut who was among seven crew members who died aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger when it exploded in 1986 after liftoff.

headline: Guantanamo defense lawyers ask to restrict CIA's use of information in 9/11 case
byline: By Jane Sutton
8:31am EDT

Attorneys defending a Guantanamo prisoner charged in the 9/11 plot turned the tables on Tuesday and asked for restrictions on the way the CIA can use private information that defense lawyers generate.

Previous discussions of classified information in the Guantanamo war crimes tribunal have focused on defense lawyers' responsibility to safeguard information collected by the government.

But the pretrial hearing at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base on Tuesday revealed concerns about information flowing in the opposite direction.

Defense lawyers said that without new limits, they could be co-opted as intelligence gatherers for the CIA, which reviews some of the defense teams' confidential internal memos to determine if the information in them is classified.

"We need to avoid becoming one more source in their all-source analysis," said attorney James Connell, who represents defendant Ammar al Baluchi, an alleged al Qaeda money mover also known as Ali Abdul Aziz Ali.

Virtually every secrecy debate in the 9/11 case involves the CIA and the overseas prisons where it held and interrogated the five alleged al Qaeda conspirators for three or four years before they were sent to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba in 2006.

The government maintains everything about that now-defunct program is top secret and that disclosure could jeopardize national security, although some details have leaked or been disclosed by the CIA itself.

Before investigating information gleaned from their clients in preparation for trial, defense lawyers must determine whether the information is secret. If it is, they cannot discuss it or try to verify it with anyone who lacks U.S. security clearances.

Such people include former Guantanamo prisoners who were held with the defendants, or foreign government sources who are privy to some details of their treatment.

CLASSIFICATION REVIEW

Defense lawyers submit their internal investigation memos to the Defense Department's Office of Special Security, or OSS, for a classification review.

"OSS has told us that the vast majority of our information goes to the CIA," Connell said.

He asked the judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, to order that those filings be "â&euro;&tilde;compartmentalized," or walled off to prevent them from being circulated throughout the CIA or disclosed to the military investigators and prosecutors who are their courtroom adversaries.

"Otherwise it's simply a long route of sending my memo to the prosecution," Connell said.

Pohl seemed skeptical that he had authority to ask the CIA reviewers to sign a non-disclosure agreement. He has said repeatedly that he does not have authority to classify or declassify any information. Only the agency that classified it as secret in the first place can do that.

The issue was part of a far-ranging discussion on the handling of secret information in the case against the defendants, who could be executed if they are convicted of conspiracy, murder and other charges.

Four of the five defendants skipped Tuesday's court session. The one who showed up, Yemeni prisoner Ramzi bin al Shibh, was allowed to leave after the lunch break, angrily accusing the guards of refusing to serve him a meal.

"This is one sort of psychological torture," bin al Shibh told the judge.

A spokesman for the detention operation, Navy Captain Robert Durand, said bin al Shibh had been given a fresh meal prepared in accordance with Islamic dietary guidelines, but he had "complained that his lunch did not include condiments such as olives and honey."

The accused mastermind of the 9/11 plot, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and his four co-defendants are accused of training and funding the hijackers who crashed four commercial jets into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania in 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people.

Prosecutors want to start the trial in September 2014, but defense lawyers say it could be three years or more before they are ready. They will not receive most of the secret evidence in the case until the court resolves questions about how it must be handled.



headline: Michael Jackson estate fights U.S. IRS in Tax Court
byline: By Patrick Temple-West
8:31am EDT

The estate of pop music legend Michael Jackson is fighting the Internal Revenue Service over taxes and penalties levied on a wide range of the star's assets, including the Neverland Ranch, his "image and likeness" and some recording properties, according to court documents.

The estate's challenge, filed in U.S. Tax Court, does not disclose any dollar amounts, suggesting the differences in estate taxes paid and allegedly owed could be significant, said tax lawyers who reviewed the court filings on Tuesday.

The dispute centers on the value of estate assets at the time of Jackson's death on June 25, 2009. Some assets, such as the star's image and likeness, are extremely difficult to value for tax purposes.

Under tax law, the penalties associated with the IRS's allegations could be as high as 40 percent of the difference between the taxes paid and those allegedly owed for some of the items.

Though dollar amounts in the documents are redacted, the IRS's deficiency notice said the tax agency levied penalties on the value of Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, which includes the Neverland Ranch, according to the court filings.

The IRS issued to the estate a tax deficiency notice in May and the estate filed its challenge in Tax Court on July 26. The IRS has 60 days to respond to the Tax Court challenge.

Negotiators for the IRS and the estate have held meetings for more than a year to try to resolve the valuation differences, said Charles Rettig, one of the lawyers representing the Jackson estate. He declined to say how much in taxes and penalties are in dispute.

"The government believes estates of celebrities likely have a significant audit potential," Rettig said on Tuesday. "The estate believes the estate tax return properly reflected the interests of Mr. Jackson as of the date of his death."

An IRS spokesman declined to comment.

Under Tax Court rules, the Jackson estate will not need to pay any taxes or penalties unless the court rules for the IRS.

Jackson died at age 50 from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol while rehearsing for a series of comeback concerts in London.

"The Michael Jackson estate was on a clear collision course with the Tax Court," said Bridget Crawford, a tax professor at Pace Law School, who reviewed the Tax Court filings.

old who brandished a knife on a streetcar was released on C$510,000 ($491,000) bail on Tuesday.

Outlining a rare murder charge against an on-duty police officer, the Toronto police force's Special Investigations Unit said on Monday it had grounds to believe that Constable James Forcillo broke the law in the death of Sammy Yatim.

The late-night shooting was filmed by bystanders and widely distributed online. It prompted Toronto's Chief of Police Bill Blair to say he was looking for answers and to promise a "thorough review."

One clip viewed more than 800,000 times on YouTube shows a figure on a streetcar, near the car's open doors and apparently alone. Someone yells "drop the knife" several times. Then there are nine loud bangs.

"Mr. Forcillo didn't ask to be at the foot of that streetcar. He was on duty, and he had a legal obligation to be there," Forcillo's lawyer Peter Brauti told reporters, after he was asked whether it was unusual for someone charged with murder to be granted bail so quickly.

Second-degree murder carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison in Canada, but with the possibility of parole. Canada has no death penalty.

ever municipal bankruptcy case.

The $92 million of one-year state aid revenue notes sold through the Michigan Finance Authority came with a whopping 4.375 percent coupon and priced at par, according to a pricing sheet from lead manager JP Morgan Securities.

The yield on the Detroit school notes, which were rated SP-1 by Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services, was almost 22 times the yield triple-A-rated Columbus, Ohio, got for $19.8 million of one-year limited tax notes it sold on Tuesday. Those notes were priced with a yield of 20 basis points and a 2 percent coupon.

"It has Detroit in the name, and there's some headline risk," said Dominic Vonella, a Municipal Market Data analyst.

Like Detroit, the city's school district is run by a state-appointed emergency manager and is beset with substantial financial problems aggravated by long industrial decline. Detroit's city government on July 18 filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy court protection, reporting more than $18 billion of liabilities.

Michigan Treasurer Andy Dillon, who oversees the state Finance Authority, said he was pleased with the results of the debt issuance, which was well-oversubscribed with $600 million of orders from 30 firms.

"The level of investor interest in the transaction continues to demonstrate the strong demand for Michigan investments," Dillon said in a statement.

A school district spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deal.

Some other local Michigan issuers have delayed planned debt sales in recent weeks because of a shoot-up in yields since the Detroit filing, which has spooked some retail buyers. Tax-free yields are at two-year highs.

The Detroit school district notes are backed by promised state revenue due the school system but on a subordinate basis behind certain senior lien obligations, according to a preliminary offering statement for the sale.

On Tuesday, trading in the secondary market was light and spotty. Many maturities on MMD's scale of AAA-rated issues were unchanged while other, mostly near-term maturities declined enough to lift yields by as many as 6 basis points. Most changes were smaller.

Both the benchmark 10-year and 30-year maturities on the MMD scale remained flat, with the 10-year staying at 2.90 percent and the 30-year ending at 4.40 percent.

headline: Army judge to sentence WikiLeaks' Manning on Wednesday
byline: By Medina Roshan
8:31am EDT

Bradley Manning, the soldier convicted of giving classified U.S. files to WikiLeaks, will be told at 10 a.m. EDT on Wednesday how much of his life will be spent in a military prison, a U.S. Army spokesman said on Tuesday.

The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, began deliberating Manning's sentence on Tuesday and later told the court that sentencing would take place at 10 a.m., the spokesman said.

Manning, a 25-year-old private first class, could face as up to 90 years in prison for giving more than 700,000 classified files, battlefield videos and diplomatic cables to the pro-transparency website. Prosecutors asked for 60 years, while the defense asked the judge not to rob him of his youth.

Manning, who was a low-level intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2010 when he handed over the documents, was convicted in July on 20 counts including espionage and theft.

He was found not guilty on the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, which had carried a possible sentence of life in prison without parole.

The classified material that shocked many around the world was a 2007 gunsight video of a U.S. Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Baghdad. A dozen people were killed, including two Reuters news staff, and WikiLeaks dubbed the footage "Collateral Murder."

The release of the documents catapulted WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, to the international spotlight and heightened a debate on government secrecy. A U.S. rights group has said Manning should be a candidate for this year's Nobel Peace Prize.

Prosecutors have contended that when Manning turned over the secret documents he had put national security, including overseas intelligence operatives, at risk.

BROADER DEBATE

His defense argued that the slightly built soldier had hoped to spark a broader debate on the role of the U.S. military and make Americans aware of the nature of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

According to defense testimony, military supervisors ignored erratic behavior by Manning that included trying to grab a gun during a counseling session.

Defense attorneys had argued that such actions showed that Manning, who is gay and was increasingly isolated while deployed to Iraq, was not fit for duty overseas.

During a pretrial hearing, Lind reduced Manning's sentence by 112 days because of harsh treatment after his arrest in 2010. He likely will be imprisoned at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Earlier this year, Manning pleaded guilty to lesser charges but military prosecutors continued their effort to convict him on more serious counts.

Manning apologized to the court for what he had done, saying, "I understand I must pay a price for my decisions."

The trial is winding down at the same time the United States is seeking the return of Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who disclosed details of secret U.S. programs that included monitoring Americans' telephone and Internet traffic. Snowden has been given temporary asylum in Russia.



headline: Britain defends detention of journalist's partner
byline: By Estelle Shirbon and Michael Holden
8:31am EDT

The British government, accused of abusing media freedom, said on Tuesday police were right to detain a journalist's partner if they thought lives might be at risk from data he was carrying from fugitive U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.

Facing legal and diplomatic complaints after police held Guardian writer Glenn Greenwald's Brazilian partner for nine hours on Sunday - and accused by the newspaper of forcing it to trash computers holding copies of Snowden's data - the interior minister said officers were entitled to take security measures.

Home Secretary Theresa May said police held David Miranda at a London airport under anti-terrorism powers, which allow for action to prevent stolen data to aid terrorists. Material from Snowden, published by the Guardian, has revealed extensive U.S. and British surveillance of global communications networks.

"It's absolutely right that if the police believe that somebody is in possession of highly sensitive, stolen information that could help terrorists, that could risk lives, lead to a potential loss of life, the police are able to act - and that's what the law enables them to do," May told the BBC.

She added, however, that an independent reviewer was looking into the police conduct.

As interior minister, May said she was briefed in advance that Miranda might be stopped but she stressed that she did not decide whom the police detained. The United States said Britain gave it a "heads up" but it did not ask for Miranda to be questioned.

Snowden, who faces criminal charges in the United States, has been granted a year's asylum by Russia.

A British lawyer who launched an action on the Brazilian's behalf to question the legal basis of his detention said police seized a laptop computer, a telephone, memory sticks, a computer hard drive and a games console from him. He was released without charge after reaching a time limit on such detentions.

Miranda had been in transit at Heathrow airport, carrying material from Snowden that was being passed from Berlin-based American documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras to Greenwald, an American writer for Britain's Guardian who lives in Rio de Janeiro.

"These items contain sensitive, confidential journalistic material and should not have been seized," Miranda's London lawyers wrote in a letter to May and the police.

Brazil's government has complained to Britain. The action against Miranda also was denounced by British opposition politicians, human rights lawyers and press freedom groups.

The leaks by Snowden, a former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, gave details of NSA and British surveillance of public telephone and internet traffic. The United States and Britain say their agencies acted within their laws and the leaks threatened their national security.

'YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN'

On Tuesday, Guardian editors revealed how and why the newspaper destroyed computer hard drives containing copies of some of the secret files leaked by Snowden.

A timeline of events provided by the Guardian said initial British attempts to stop reporting on the files came two weeks after the newspaper published its first three stories based on Snowden's leaks.

These stories were about a secret U.S. court order obliging communications company Verizon to hand over data on customers' phone usage, Britain's secretive Government Communications Headquarters' (GCHQ) use of data from a NSA internet monitoring program, and British intelligence spying on allies in London.

Shortly afterward, two senior British officials arrived to see editor Alan Rusbridger to demand the newspaper hand over all its Snowden files, arguing the material was stolen, according to the Guardian's timeline. He refused.

Three weeks later, in July, after the publication of more articles, officials got back in touch with Rusbridger and told him, according to the newspaper: "You've had your fun. Now we want the stuff back."

The officials expressed fears that foreign governments, particularly Russia or China, could hack into the newspaper's IT network although the journalists stressed the documents were not stored on any Guardian system but held in isolation, according to the newspaper.

Between July 16 and 19, the Guardian said government pressure intensified and there was an explicit threat of legal action if the newspaper did not comply.

Rusbridger said he decided that if the government was determined to stop Britain-based reporting on the Snowden files, the best option was to destroy the London copy and to edit and report from the same material held in the United States and Brazil.

On July 20, two "security experts" from GCHQ visited the paper's London head office and watched as deputy editor Paul Johnson, executive director Sheila Fitzsimons and a newspaper computer expert used angle grinders and other tools to pulverize hard drives and memory chips storing encrypted files, according to the newspaper.

Both sides were aware other copies existed outside the Britain.

"I hope what (the Miranda detention controversy) will do is to send people back to read the stories that so upset the British state because there has been a lot of reporting about what GCHQ and the NSA are up to," Rusbridger said.

Downing Street and GCHQ have declined to comment.

In Washington, a White House spokesman said he could not comment on the destruction of some of the Guardian's Snowden material. But he said he could not see U.S. authorities destroying an American media company's hard drives to protect national security.

"That's very difficult to imagine a scenario in which that would be appropriate," spokesman John Earnest told reporters.

Britain came under criticism from press freedom group Index on Censorship, which denounced the forced destruction of computers revealed by Guardian editors.

"It is clear that the Snowden and NSA story is strongly in the public interest," the group said. "It seems that the UK government is using, and quite literally misusing, laws to intimidate journalists and silence its critics."

A British source with knowledge of the security services said GCHQ had no powers to seize material from the Guardian, but could have accused the newspaper of possessing stolen materials and demanded they be destroyed.



headline: Dolphins football legends reap White House praise 40 years late
byline: By Mark Felsenthal
8:31am EDT

haired, bespectacled, their coach in a motorized chair, former athletes there to receive an accolade 40 years late.

Members of the Miami Dolphins, whose undefeated 1972 season culminated in a Super Bowl victory in January, 1973, stood smiling behind the president on Tuesday, blinking in the TV lights and basking in the applause of the crowd and the praise of the First Sports Fan.

"In 1972, these guys were a juggernaut," the president said, ticking off their accomplishments: a perfect 17-0 record that included a misleadingly close 14-7 thrashing of the Washington Redskins in the title game, leading the league in offense and defense, and fielding seven future football Hall of Famers.

It is the only National Football League team to have gone undefeated or untied all season since the National and the American Football Leagues merged in 1970.

The White House offered no clear reason why it is honoring the team decades after its signature accomplishment. Championship teams are routinely invited to the White House nowadays, a testament to the American passion for sports, not to mention the public relations benefits of posing the president with successful athletes.

But the practice of welcoming Super Bowl victors to the White House didn't start until 1980, the president said, so it was time to make amends.

"I know this is a little unorthodox, four decades after the fact - but these guys never got their White House visit after winning Super Bowl VII," he said. "And let's face it, this is also just a fun thing to do."

Obama, fresh from holiday on Martha's Vineyard last week, appeared relaxed. The president, who turned 52 in July, joked that he had to explain to his staff, many of whom are 20 years younger than he is, the significance of the team's football dominance at the start of President Richard Nixon's second term.

"I know that some people may be asking why we're doing this after all these years. And my answer is simple: I wanted to be the young guy up here for once," he said, to laughter.

Obama noted the players' accomplishments after their football careers as well, such as the support of former linebacker Nick Buoniconti, who son was paralyzed in a football accident, for spinal cord research.

Hall of Fame players Larry Csonka, Bob Griese, and Larry Little were among members of the team who were at the White House.

Coach Don Shula said it was his first time at the White House - but not his first contact with a president. Nixon, who vacationed in Florida, would call him to suggest plays, Shula said.

"I would always listen to him" and once used one of his suggestions, he said.

Not every member of the team was pleased to be at the White House. At least three, Bob Kuechenberg, Manny Fernandez, and Jim Langer told the Florida Sun-Sentinel that they would pass on the visit because of differences with the president.

headline: Jury selected for sentencing of U.S. soldier in Afghan massacre

8:31am EDT

A jury of six military personnel was impaneled on Tuesday for the sentencing of a decorated U.S. soldier who pleaded guilty in June to killing 16 Afghan civilians in two nighttime forays from his Army post last year, an Army spokeswoman said.

Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, a veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, has admitted to gunning down the villagers, mostly women and children, in attacks on their family compounds in Kandahar province in March 2012.

In exchange for his guilty plea, Bales will be spared the death penalty. The jury will determine whether he will spend the rest of his natural life in prison or be eligible for the possibility of parole after 20 years.

The jury is evenly split between commissioned and non-commissioned officers ranging in rank from master sergeant to colonel, according to Army spokeswoman Major Allison Aguilar. Four potential jurors were dismissed from an initial jury pool of 10.

Army prosecutors have said Bales acted alone and with chilling premeditation when, armed with a pistol, a rifle and a grenade launcher, he left his base twice in the night, returning in the middle of his rampage to tell a fellow soldier: "I just shot up some people."

The shootings marked the worst case of civilian slaughter blamed on a rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.

Defense attorneys said on Monday that they would argue during the sentencing hearing that post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury were factors in the killings, while prosecutors hoped to show Bales had engaged in a pattern of bad behavior that predated his multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.

The proceedings at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington are expected to last at least a week.

Prosecutors have said they intend to play for jurors taped telephone conversations between an incarcerated Bales and his wife, Kari, laughing about the charges leveled against him and discussing a possible book deal for her.

Defense lawyers said those discussions and others that prosecutors want to use were taken out of context.

The military judge presiding over the case said on Monday that the complete phone conversations could be played for the jury. On Tuesday he ruled that extended portions of the phone conversations could be played.

Bales acknowledged the killings upon pleading guilty and told the court there was "not a good reason in this world" for his actions.

degree murder in a 2011 case of a teen who was lured by text message to an ambush where he was shot, dismembered and incinerated.

Michael Bargo, now 21, faces the death penalty for killing 15-year-old Seath Tyler Jackson whose remains were shoveled into paint cans and discarded, according to an arrest affidavit.

The jurors will return to the courtroom at a later date to begin a second phase of the trial to determine whether Bargo is sentenced to death as requested by prosecutors or to life in prison.

Four co-defendants, including two teenage girls, previously admitted their roles in the murder and are serving life prison sentences, according to court records. Their statements helped authorities piece together what happened.

According to an arrest affidavit, the two girls, then-18-year-old Charlie Kay Ely and 15-year-old Amber Wright, helped lure Jackson via text message to a home in Summerfield, northwest of Orlando.

Bargo, along with then-16-year-old Kyle Hooper and 20-year-old Justin Soto, beat and shot Jackson, put him in a bathtub and tried to break his kneecaps so he could be folded and stuffed in a sleeping bag, according to a report by Marion County Sheriff.

When they noticed Jackson was still alive, Bargo shot him again and they threw his body in the sleeping bag into a fire pit that had been lit before Jackson arrived, authorities said. His remains were put into paint cans.

Two days later, Hooper told his mother what happened and later told investigators the house was cleaned with bleach. Investigators found no clear motive other than that Bargo allegedly did not like Jackson.

After both sides rested in the trial, Bargo changed his mind and asked to testify on his own behalf.

Bargo's lawyer, Charles Holloman, argued to the jury that his client was guilty but not of the premeditated first-degree murder as charged.

An Iraq war veteran accused of fatally shooting former U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, a decorated sniper, and another man at a shooting range in Texas was arraigned Tuesday on two counts of capital murder, his attorney said.

Eddie Ray Routh, 25, was indicted in July on two counts of murder in the February shooting deaths of Kyle, and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at the upscale Rough Creek Lodge resort about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth.

Routh, who is being held on $3 million bond, appeared in Erath County court for his arraignment on the charges, defense attorney R. Shay Isham said.

Routh would be eligible for life without parole or the death penalty if convicted. His trial is scheduled to begin October 21.

Kyle and Littlefield had taken Routh to the shooting range to help him relax and deal with personal problems, police have said.

Routh is accused of killing them, then fleeing in Kyle's truck to his sister's house in the Dallas suburb of Midlothian, where he confessed to shooting Kyle and Littlefield, police said.

In a 911 emergency call, Routh's sister and her husband told a dispatcher Routh suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and had been hospitalized at a mental institution, police said.

Kyle served four combat tours of duty in Iraq and elsewhere and was awarded two Silver Stars and five Bonze Stars for bravery, according to his book, "American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in Military History."

Kyle's book, "American Gun - A History of the U.S. in Ten Firearms" became a best seller after it was published in June.

Eight people were injured, one of them seriously, after an explosion and fire struck a U.S. Navy ammunitions depot near the New Jersey shore on Tuesday, Navy officials said.

Fire trucks, ambulances and a medical emergency helicopter rushed to Naval Weapons Station Earle, located near Colts Neck Township, about 45 miles from Manhattan. The cause of the explosion at a Marine boat repair shop at about 9 a.m. EDT was being investigated.

"The damage from the explosion was contained within the boathouse area. Ammunition and ordnance operations at the weapons station were not affected by the accident," the Navy said in a statement.

The injured included seven sailors and one civilian, said base spokesman Mike Brady.

One of the injured was seriously hurt and taken by medical helicopter to a local hospital for treatment, though the type of injuries sustained were still unknown, he said. The seven others suffered minor injuries, including smoke inhalation.

The explosion occurred during routine maintenance on a 35-foot utility boat and the blast ripped apart both the vessel and much of the adjoining building, Brady said.

A base firehouse is located next door to the boat repair shop and was able to respond "almost immediately," he said.

Brady said the stores of ammunition on the base are kept in an area separate from where boats are serviced and the explosion posed no threat to the adjoining community.

The base, which has a workforce of 1,500 people, has several facilities located in Colts Neck and surrounding towns, according to the U.S. Navy website. It serves as the "operational support base for five Military Sealift Commands combat logistics ships," according to the website.



headline: Charges expected in killing of Australian by 'bored' U.S. teenagers

8:31am EDT

Charges are expected to be filed on Tuesday in the suspected killing of an Australian university student in Oklahoma by three "bored" teenagers who decided to kill someone for fun, according to prosecutors and police.

Christopher Lane, of Melbourne, was found dead of a gunshot wound Friday, according to police in Duncan, Oklahoma, located about 81 miles south of Oklahoma City.

Lane was out jogging during a visit to his girlfriend and her family in Duncan Friday when he was shot in the back, police said. He attended East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma where he was on a baseball scholarship.

According to police, three juvenile male suspects were arrested in connection with the shooting, and the 17-year-old who was driving the car carrying the suspects allegedly admitted that they decided to kill someone "for the fun of it." The other teens were 15 and 16, police said.

A representative of the Stephens County District Attorney's office said charges would be filed. The office is expected to issue a statement later on Tuesday.

Police say a witness called 911 when she saw Lane stagger across the road and fall.

According to police, the 17-year-old suspect told police on Sunday that they saw Lane jogging and decided he would be their target. Ford said the three followed him in their vehicle and shot Lane in the back.

Police used surveillance video from area businesses to identify the vehicle, which was found later at a church parking lot with the three suspects inside after a caller reported three youths at the address with guns who were threatening to kill someone.

The vehicle's trunk also contained a shotgun with the serial numbers sanded off, but the actual weapon used in the shooting has not been found, police said.

Lane's father, Peter Lane, called the killing "senseless" in an interview broadcast on CNN from Australia.

"There's not going to be any good coming out of this because it was so senseless," Lane said. "It happened, it's wrong and we're just trying to deal with it the best we can."

Lane had started as a catcher for the ECU Tigers.

In a statement, ECU baseball coach Dino Rosato said Lane was a well-respected teammate.

"He was an absolute joy to coach," said Rosato. "He set a great example for all of his teammates, but more importantly for the younger players. He was a mature student-athlete who his teammates could look to for advice and support."

whipped blaze.

The so-called Beaver Creek fire has destroyed one home and seven other buildings and forced the evacuation of thousands. It was sparked by lightning nearly two weeks ago outside Sun Valley, one of three tourist communities that make up a resort area in central Idaho valued at $8 billion.

Blaine County Sheriff Gene Ramsey on Tuesday told occupants of 600 homes in upscale developments south of the twin towns of Sun Valley and Ketchum that they could return but should be prepared to leave at a moment's notice.

That brought to 1,250 from a high of 2,250 the number of houses under a mandatory evacuation order in the path of a fire that has prompted the ski resort in Sun Valley to keep flames at bay by turning on water cannons usually used to make snow.

"I think the tide has turned in our favor today," Blaine County spokeswoman Bronwyn Nickel said. "The general energy and optimism has increased. We're by no means out of the woods but people are starting to worry a little less."

More than 1,800 firefighters are assigned to a blaze that has raged across 106,000 acres of drought-stricken sagebrush flats and pine forests in the Sawtooth Mountains.

Lower temperatures and higher humidity levels on Tuesday allowed firefighters to attack the fire directly instead of being on the defensive, fire information officer Richard Reuse said.

The fire has strained the area's tourism economy at the height of a summer recreation season tied to camping, hiking and biking.

The resort area known as the Wood River Valley is home to such celebrities as singer Barbra Streisand, director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks.

MANY FIRES, STRAINED RESOURCES

Elite firefighting units known as hotshots worked on the ground while helicopters dropped fire retardant on a flank of the fire that had advanced on Ketchum and crews protected homes that have been guarded by fire engines.

The flames were less than 10 percent contained. But fire managers said they were making headway thanks to calmer winds and because of sustained ground and air attacks that began on Sunday.

The Beaver Creek blaze is one of dozens of fires raging across Western states that have strained U.S. Forest Service resources because of federal budget cuts known as sequestration.

Officials with the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise said the indicator of fire preparedness, a measure of the demand for firefighting resources like crews and aircraft, has been raised to the maximum level for the first time since 2008.

Asked if the budget cuts played a role in the decision to ratchet up the index, the center's Roberta D'Amico said, "There has been some adjustment this year because of sequestration. We are in a situation where funding is tight. We do have to evaluate where to put resources and there has been a modest impact from sequestration."

Elsewhere in Idaho, a fire advancing on a small mountain town east of Boise quadrupled in size on Tuesday, growing from 2,000 acres on Monday to 8,000 acres.

The blaze has forced the evacuation of 65 homes in the community of Atlanta, which is fewer than four miles from advancing flames, federal fire information officer Arnold Hartigan said.

Meanwhile, in Northern California, a wildfire that has already charred more than 10,000 acres and destroyed two homes was threatening some 2,500 other structures west of Yosemite National Park.

Authorities closed Highway 120, east of Modesto, and said no traffic was being allowed out of the westbound entrance to Yosemite.

More than 450 firefighters were battling the so-called Rim Fire, which broke out on Saturday afternoon, but officials said it was zero percent contained as of Tuesday afternoon and burning in steep, remote terrain that was difficult for crews to access.



headline: Prosecution rests in Fort Hood shooting rampage court-martial

martial of an Army psychiatrist accused of opening fire on unarmed soldiers at Fort Hood in 2009, killing 13 and wounding more than 30.

Major Nidal Hasan, an American-born Muslim, has admitted in court to gunning down soldiers at a medical complex at the sprawling military base in central Texas, saying he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war against Islam.

The government rested its case after calling 89 witnesses in two weeks of testimony, with many describing in horrific detail the bloodbath in and around a medical building at Fort Hood on November 5, 2009.

Hasan, 42, who is acting as his own attorney, signaled he may not mount any defense. He passed up an opportunity on Tuesday to move for an immediate not guilty verdict, which is within a defendant's rights after the prosecution has rested.

Hasan faces 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of premeditated attempted murder. He could face the death penalty if all 13 officers on the jury find him guilty.

He told mental health evaluators that he wanted to become a martyr as a result of his attack, court documents show. Lawyers assisting him say he is seeking the death penalty, but he has denied that claim.

Shot by police during the incident, he is paralyzed from the waist down and attends court in a wheelchair. He has requested frequent breaks in the testimony for rest and for prayer.

EYES ON DEFENSE

The trial is in recess until Wednesday, when all eyes will be on Hasan's efforts, if any, to counter two weeks of emotional and often graphic testimony about the bloody attack.

He could call witnesses, though he has indicated he has no plans to do that. Or he could call himself and testify in his own defense in a one-man question-and-answer format.

Experts have speculated he might be waiting until the sentencing phase, if he is found guilty of the charges, to present his side of the story.

Military judge Colonel Tara Osburn told Hasan he could meet on Tuesday night with a religious conversion expert he had once indicated he may want to call to the stand and give his final decision about witnesses on Wednesday.

Among the last to testify for the prosecution was Army psychiatrist Tonya Kozminski, who told the court Hasan warned her while they were on a weekend shift at the Darnell Medical Center that something bad would happen if they tried to send him to war.

"I don't remember the first line exactly word for word, whether it was ‘If they send me to Iraq' or ‘Afghanistan,' or ‘If they deploy me,' one of those type sentences," she said. "Something of that nature was the first line, but the second line, the last thing he said to me, was, ‘They will pay.'"



headline: Detroit bankruptcy challenged on constitutional grounds
byline: By Joseph Lichterman and Bernie Woodall
8:31am EDT

Public labor unions took aim at Detroit's historic bankruptcy filing on Monday, asking a U.S. court to toss the city's bid for protection from its creditors because it is constitutionally flawed on both the state and federal levels.

A union that represents public-sector workers even took the unusual step of arguing that Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code, under which municipalities seek protection from their creditors, violates the U.S. Constitution.

But as a midnight deadline for filing objections to the bankruptcy passed, Detroit's bondholders were conspicuously absent from the long list of unions, pension funds and individual creditors lining up to argue against bankruptcy.

Unions representing the city's firefighters and police alleged that state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr had failed to negotiate in good faith, stating "there were no negotiations."

Under U.S. bankruptcy code, Detroit must prove it is insolvent and has negotiated with creditors in good faith, or there were too many creditors to make negotiations feasible, in order to be certified by a federal judge for a bankruptcy proceeding.

For his part, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said in a filing that even if the bankruptcy case continues, the city cannot be allowed to ignore state constitutional protections for retirement benefits earned by its employees.

Schuette's filing does not ask the judge to prevent Detroit's bankruptcy from proceeding.

Unions and the city's two public pension funds made similar arguments in their filings, claiming a bankruptcy filing will lead to an unconstitutional reduction in retirement benefits.

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 25, in its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Detroit, argued that Chapter 9 encroaches on states' rights.

The union made more conventional legal arguments as well.

It argued that Detroit, which last month filed for what would rank as the largest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy, has not proven it is insolvent and has not negotiated in good faith with its creditors.

AFSCME also said Michigan's emergency manager law, which enabled Detroit to file for bankruptcy on July 18, violates the state constitution because the law does not explicitly protect retirement benefits for public workers.

The United Auto Workers, whose members work for the city, also filed an objection early Monday evening, claiming that Gov. Rick Snyder violated Michigan's constitution when he permitted Detroit's emergency manager Kevyn Orr to file for bankruptcy.

A June 14 "Proposal to Creditors" made roughly a month before the bankruptcy filing "serves as the vehicle of Governor Snyder and EM Orr to use federal bankruptcy law to impair pensions protected from impairment" by the Michigan constitution, the UAW said in its objection.

AFSCME's arguments were adopted by two other city unions -SEIU Local 517 and International Union of Operating Engineers Local 324 - in separate filings.

Municipal bankruptcy experts said the U.S. Supreme Court settled Chapter 9's constitutionality in 1938.

Jim Spiotto, an attorney at Chapman and Cutler, said as long as a state allows a local government to file for bankruptcy, as in Detroit's case, states' rights are not at issue.

"I'm sure somebody at the bankruptcy court level brought it up before, but I don't think (the argument) lasted very long," he said.

An AFSCME spokesman did not return messages seeking comment on the federal constitutional argument.

Schuette, the Michigan attorney general, said in his filing that Detroit is bankrupt, and the governor was authorized to allow the city's bankruptcy petition.

"However, throughout this bankruptcy process, protections enshrined in the Michigan Constitution by the citizens of our state must be honored, respected and followed," Schuette said, pointing to a constitutional prohibition against diminishing or impairing accrued retirement benefits for public workers.

He added unaccrued benefits can still be part of proceedings.

CLOCK TICKING

Prior to the 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time deadline set for Monday night by U.S. Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing Detroit's case, objections had been expected by bondholders and bond insurers.

Members of both groups have challenged an agreement the city reached with counter parties to interest-rate swaps that would enable the city to unwind its swaps contracts at a discounted rate.

No explanation was immediately available for why no objection was filed by bondholders and bond insurers. Bond insurers, which step in and make debt payments on the city's behalf when it cannot meet its obligations, are particularly at risk after Orr in June announced plans to default on Detroit debt he considers unsecured.

In a court filing earlier this month, Detroit released a list of creditors, including current, former and retired workers, that filled 3,504 pages. An initial filing in the case by Orr said that "further negotiations with all of the city's various stakeholders is impracticable."

Orr's filing included a litany of Detroit's financial woes, including more than $18 billion in debt and other obligations, with nearly $12 billion of that amount considered unsecured.

Detroit, a former manufacturing powerhouse and cradle of the U.S. automotive industry and Motown music, has struggled for decades as companies moved or closed, crime surged and its population fell from a peak of 1.8 million in the 1950s to around 700,000 currently. The city's revenue fell short of spending, while its budgets and borrowing ballooned.

Orr will respond "specifically and completely" to the objections in court, said his spokesman, Bill Nowling.

"Mr. Orr believes he has surpassed the legal standard of negotiating in good faith with creditors and stakeholders," Nowling said. "He submitted a proposed restructuring plan to creditors on June 14."

About 50 individuals filed objections at the federal court in Detroit on Monday morning. The group was organized by the Detroit chapter of the National Action Network, a national civil rights organization founded by Rev. Al Sharpton.

The group's objection cites potential constitutional problems with a Michigan law that allowed for the bankruptcy filing and claims that the judge did not allow enough time for objection filings.

Rev. Charles Williams II, the chapter's president, said many residents, himself included, received notice only last week that they were parties of interest who could object to the filing.

"The process hasn't been as clear and transparent as it should have," Williams said. "Many Detroit residents received letters giving them the opportunity to file for an objection and they didn't even know they received it. They weren't properly notified."

Rhodes has scheduled October 23 for the start of a hearing to determine if Detroit is eligible to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9. If Detroit is deemed eligible for municipal bankruptcy, it would be the biggest such case in U.S. history.

Detroit's largest unsecured creditors are its two pension funds, which have claims totaling $3.74 billion in estimated unfunded liabilities, according to a court filing by the city.

The remainder of the city's top 20 creditors include bondholders of $1.47 billion of certificates of participation that Detroit sold for its pension funds and hundreds of million dollars of general obligation bonds.

The Detroit Institute of Arts said on Monday it will not file an objection to the bankruptcy. The DIA has become embroiled in the city's case because its assets, which include works by Van Gogh and Matisse, could be sold to pay Detroit's debt. However, Orr has said he hopes he does not have to sell DIA assets.

Rhodes on Monday appointed Chicago attorney Robert Fishman as the fee examiner in the case.



headline: Mom of California kidnap victim died of blows to head
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

The mother of Southern California kidnap victim Hannah Anderson died of blunt force trauma to the head, the San Diego County Medical Examiner said Monday.

Christina Anderson, whose body was found in the burned-out garage of suspected kidnapper James DiMaggio near a crow bar and a blood stain, died in the August 4 tragedy along with her 8-year-old son, Ethan and the family dog, Cali.

Hannah, 16, was discovered with DiMaggio days later in the Idaho wilderness, after a widely distributed amber alert that included flashing freeway signs and text messages sent to mobile phones across four states.

After the pair was spotted by local ranchers, officials rescued Hannah and killed DiMaggio.

The case is puzzling in part because DiMaggio was a longtime friend of Hannah's parents, Christina and Brett, and was best man at their wedding.

Authorities have said they believe he set into motion the deadly chain of events two weeks ago and took Hannah with him against her will. But they have not yet offered clues as to why he acted as he did.

The badly burned body of Ethan Anderson was found in a different part of the wreckage than his mother. Authorities have not yet released a cause of death for him.

The remains of Christina Anderson, 44, were found beneath a tarp in the garage of DiMaggio's log cabin style house in Boulevard, about 25 miles east of San Diego.

But in yet another poignant twist, a friend of the DiMaggio family said Monday that James DiMaggio made Brett Anderson's mother, Bernice, the beneficiary of a $112,000 life insurance policy.

The friend, Andrew Spanswick, said the money was intended for Ethan and Hannah and that DiMaggio made Bernice Anderson his beneficiary in 2011.

"He was living with Bernice at the time while he saved up to buy his house," said Spanswick.

He wanted to leave money to Ethan and Hannah, but didn't trust their parents to handle it properly, Spanswick said, so DiMaggio specified Bernice Anderson as his beneficiary.

Lora DiMaggio Robinson, DiMaggio's sister, does not plan to contest the payment, Spanswick said.



headline: U.S. Open tennis official sues Los Angeles police for false arrest
byline: By Dana Feldman
8:31am EDT

old tennis lineswoman arrested on a murder charge as she prepared to officiate at the U.S. Open but later cleared of bludgeoning her husband to death has filed suit against the Los Angeles police and others, her lawyer said on Monday.

Lois Goodman was arrested last August in New York on a felony murder warrant on accusations of killing her 80-year-old husband by hitting him with a coffee cup, Alan Goodman, at the couple's home in the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles in April 2012.

The charges against Goodman, who is well-known in tennis circles and had worked at the annual U.S. Open Tennis Championships tournament for at least the past 10 years, were ultimately dismissed in November.

Prosecutors at the time gave little public information to explain why they dropped the case. A Los Angeles County District Attorney's spokeswoman said at the time only that "additional information" had come forward.

In her federal lawsuit, officially registered in federal court in Los Angeles on Monday against the police, coroner and four individual police officers, Goodman claims false arrest and malicious prosecution.

Paraded out of a New York hotel in handcuffs in front of media, jailed and suspended from work as a referee, Goodman came under intense scrutiny for four months before she was finally cleared.

Her lawyer, Robert Sheahen, said Goodman's husband died in a tragic accidental fall, and her subsequent arrest caused her to suffer humiliation, physical pain from confinement in jail and damage to her career.

"She loves tennis, she loves her job. This was devastating to the tennis world. It's a very small world," Sheahen told Reuters by phone.

In the 21-page complaint, Sheahen said his client, in addition to suffering the loss of her spouse of nearly 50 years, had a truncated grieving period due to the arrest and being thrown into a "veritable dungeon" while incarcerated at Rikers Island, causing both emotional and physical distress.

Goodman also said the Los Angeles police intentionally lied to the media, claiming she was having an affair as well as online relationships with two U.S. Open officials.

Goodman's daughter, Joan, told the New York Post that her mother was anxious about making a comeback to the prestigious tennis event scheduled to begin August 26, adding that her mother is "grateful she has her job and wants to be able to do it without distraction."



headline: California gets OK to force-feed some hunger-striking inmates
byline: By Sharon Bernstein
8:31am EDT

feed some prisoners on a hunger strike after officials voiced concerns that inmates may have been coerced into refusing food in a protest against the state's solitary confinement policies.

U.S. District Court Judge Thelton E. Henderson, responding to a request by state authorities, ruled that California prison doctors may force-feed select inmates near death, even if they had previously signed orders asking not to be resuscitated.

Some 136 California inmates are currently taking part in a hunger strike that began July 8 in prisons statewide to demand an end to a policy of housing inmates believed to be associated with gangs in near-isolation for years. Some 69 of the striking inmates have refused food continuously since the strike began.

This is the second time prisoners have launched a hunger strike to protest the state's practice of housing some inmates for years in its four Security Housing Units.

About 4,500 prisoners were housed in the units when the strike began, officials said. State officials say the units are needed to stem the influence of prison gangs - and in fact, administrators have repeatedly characterized the hunger strike as a power grab by gang leaders.

But the state's policy of housing prisoners for years in these units has been condemned by a number of human rights organizations, including Amnesty International. And at least one prisoner on the hunger strike has said that he is willing to die to make his point that the detentions are inhumane.

The hunger strike is the latest problem to plague the state's prison system, which is under federal court order to reduce crowding by the end of the year, possibly by releasing up to 10,000 inmates early.

The hunger strike launched last month has already gone on twice as long as a similar protest in 2011 and has attracted more prisoners - 30,000 at its peak - although numbers have since dramatically dwindled.

Now well into a second month without food, dozens of inmates have been sent to hospitals, officials said.

Prior to the judge's decision on Monday, California policy prohibited force-feeding of inmates on a hunger strike if they had signed medical orders refusing resuscitation in the event they lost consciousness or experienced heart failure.

But officials went to court to seek permission to ignore these "do-not-resuscitate" orders for inmates who signed them during the hunger strike or just prior to it, citing concerns about possible coercion.

Henderson wrote in his order that in view of those concerns, a "do not resuscitate" order signed by such inmates would be "deemed not valid."

ERRING ON THE SIDE OF LIFE

A lawyer for some of the hunger strikers said she was not aware of inmates being coerced.

"They're exaggerating this," said inmate advocate Carol Strickman, adding that the state should not ignore inmates' wishes in such matters of life and death. "As much as I don't want to see anybody die, some people were choosing to sign those requests and some were not."

Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver in charge of medical care in the prisons, said Monday's request to invalidate the more recent "do-not-resuscitate" orders was not made on an emergency basis, and that no one was force-fed on Monday as a result.

Rather, she said, officials were trying to be proactive, so the new rules would be in place as inmates continued to become sick from refusing food.

"Inmates can deteriorate rather quickly when they have starved themselves for this long period of time so we wanted to make sure we had the order in place ... for us to be able to save their lives," Hayhoe said.

Hayhoe conceded that some of the "do-not-resuscitate" orders put in place during the hunger strike were submitted after prison medical officials advised inmates that this was the only way to avoid force-feeding. But she said officials with the Department of Corrections had presented compelling evidence that some inmates had indeed been coerced.

"It's better to err on the side of life," she said.

Hayhoe said she had talked to two inmates at California State Prison, Corcoran, who refused food or medical care because they were afraid other prisoners would find out if they didn't.

All three groups involved in a years-long lawsuit over conditions in the prisons signed on to the request to invalidate the "do-not-resuscitate" orders - the lawyers who brought a suit challenging the poor medical care and overcrowded conditions, the federal receiver and state prison officials.

headline: A-Rod paid legal retainer for owner of clinic in doping scandal

aging clinic at the center of a doping scandal that ensnared 13 professional baseball players, a spokesperson for the clinic owner said on Monday.

Rodriguez, who is fighting a lengthy suspension for his alleged doping, paid the lawyer for clinic owner Anthony Bosch a $25,000 retainer in February, and later made a second wire transfer for nearly $50,000 that the attorney declined, the spokesperson said.

Major League Baseball is suing Bosch and several other people associated with the Biogenesis clinic in a Miami area suburb for alleged interference with its anti-doping agreement with players.

The Miami attorney, Susy Ribero-Ayala, accepted the $25,000 "on behalf of Anthony Bosch as payment for his legal representation," according to Joyce Fitzpatrick, who serves as spokesperson for Bosch and Ribero-Ayala. The second payment in April, which Fitzpatrick described as "unsolicited and unwarranted," was returned. She declined further comment on the payment.

Fitzpatrick said Bosch and Rodriguez no longer have any legal relationship.

Rodriguez, who grew up in Miami, was suspended by MLB for 211 games through the end of the 2014 season. Twelve other players received 50-game suspensions.

One of the highest-paid professional athletes in the United States, Rodriguez has denied any wrongdoing, and has appealed his suspension to an arbitrator.

Lawyers for Rodriguez did not respond to a request for comment but told ESPN earlier that the second transfer had been sent in error. They did not contest the first payment.

Fitzpatrick declined to comment on media speculation about the possible appearance that Rodriguez may have been trying to persuade Bosch not to cooperate with Major League Baseball's investigation of his ties to Biogenesis.

"Mr. Bosch has consistently expressed his desire to cooperate with any and all investigative authorities," she said.

Bosch's clinic is also under federal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami for the unlicensed sale of controlled substances to professional baseball players, as well as high school students, according to lawyers familiar with the investigation.

Bosch has not spoken to the media in months, but initially denied any wrongdoing.

A Grand Jury began hearing testimony and taking evidence last Friday, the Miami Herald reported.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami launched the probe last month after Porter Fischer, a whistleblower at the defunct Biogenesis clinic said professional baseball players were not its only customers, according to legal correspondence with Fischer that was viewed by Reuters.

The probe involved an "investigation into federal illegal substance violations," according to a copy of the correspondence that was provided to Reuters in late July.

The U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on the existence of an investigation.

Fischer obtained hundreds of pages of client records from Biogenesis that he alleged show payments from some of the players for performance-enhancing drugs and that he later turned over to a Miami weekly newspaper, which published them.

The Florida Department of Health fined Bosch $5,000 in April for violating state law for diagnosing and treating patients without a proper doctor's license.



headline: Ex-Chicago official pleads not guilty to Ohio corruption charges
byline: By Brendan O'Brien
8:31am EDT

Chicago's former comptroller pleaded not guilty in federal court on Monday to charges that he took kickbacks and enriched one of his friends while serving as deputy treasurer in Ohio, court documents show.

Amer Ahmad, 38, was charged with conspiracy, bribery, fraud and money laundering over accusations he helped his friend and securities broker, Douglas Hampton, acquire lucrative business from the Ohio treasurer's office, where Ahmad worked from 2008 to 2010, according to the indictment.

Ahmad resigned as Chicago's comptroller on July 23 before news of the charges surfaced. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed Ahmad shortly after becoming mayor in 2011.

Chicago officials will conduct an audit of Ahmad's work, said Sarah Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the mayor.

The indictment is the latest black eye on Emanuel's first term as the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States, which has been mired by municipal and school budget woes, school closings and gun violence.

The indictment said that after Ahmad made sure that Hampton was on the approved broker list for the Ohio treasurer, Hampton made $3.2 million in commissions from trades he did on behalf of the state.

"Hampton received significantly more business from the (state treasurer) than any other brokers approved," the indictment said.

Ahmad's attorneys would not comment on the accusations.

Hampton went to high school with Ahmad and has been his and his wife's personal financial adviser since 1996, according to the indictment.

Hampton is accused of giving Ahmad a $400,000 kickback, disguising it as business loans, the indictment said.

The men used Ahmad's position with the state "to personally enrich themselves, their friends and associates and their businesses," the indictment said.

The alleged corruption occurred from January 2009 to January 2011. During the two years with the treasurer's office in Ohio, Ahmad also served as the state's chief financial officer.

Ahmad, who has been charged with eight counts, was released on Monday without having to post a monetary bond.

martial for shooting dead 13 fellow soldiers.

Judge Colonel Tara Osborn barred testimony about the correspondence between Hasan and Awlaki, the U.S.-born militant who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, and with other militants.

Hasan, acting as his own defense attorney, has admitted he opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, on November 5, 2009, killing 13 and wounding 31, saying he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war on Islam.

He could face the death penalty if all 13 officers on the jury find him guilty of premeditated murder.

The judge banned some evidence dating to 2005, declaring it "too remote and subject to multiple interpretations." She also blocked another exchange as a "waste of time and unfair prejudice."

More recent emails and internet searches, however, could be admitted as evidence, Osborn ruled.

That ruling cleared the way for FBI Special Agent Charles Cox, a computer forensics expert who examined Hasan's laptop after his arrest, who testified there had been 28 searches for the word "Taliban" in the months leading up to the shooting, as well as repeated searches for the word "ammo."

Early in 2009, Internet searches on the computer contained phrases such as, "killing innocent Koran" and "killing innocent women and children Koran."

More than 75 witnesses have testified in the court-martial over the past two weeks, many describing in horrific detail the bloodbath in and around a medical building at Fort Hood on November 5, 2009.

Hasan, who was shot and paralyzed upon his arrest, attends court in a wheelchair. The judge has repeatedly reminded Hasan he would be better represented by a defense attorney, saying even a lawyer should not represent himself.

Hasan has said he will continue as his own counsel.

On Monday, Hasan questioned Staff Sergeant Juan Alvarado, who testified about witnessing the shooting, including an exchange of gunfire between Hasan and military officer Sergeant Kimberly Munley, who was wounded in the exchange.

"Were you watching the whole time while I and Sergeant Kimberly Munley were shooting at each other? You didn't look away at all?" Hasan asked.

"I was watching the whole time," Alvarado said.



headline: Mechanical problem caused California limo fire that killed bride, friends
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

A failed suspension system sparked a California limousine fire that killed a new bride and four passengers trapped inside when the vehicle burst into flames on a bridge over the San Francisco Bay, investigators said on Monday.

Authorities investigating the fire on the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge in May concluded that it was an accident and that no criminal charges should be filed, law enforcement officials said at a news conference to announce the findings, which were also released in a 59-page report.

"Some tragedies are crimes and some are not. This one is not," San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said.

New bride Neriza Fojas, 31, and eight female friends were traveling across the bridge in a white stretch 1999 Lincoln Town Car for Fojas' wedding celebration, when the vehicle's interior began to smoke and catch fire.

Four of the women were able to escape by climbing through an opening that separated passengers from the limo driver compartment.

Fojas and four of her friends died of smoke inhalation while trying to climb through the same partition, San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said.

A more than three-month investigation into the accident concluded that during the drive, a failed suspension system forced the limo's drive shaft to rub against its floor pan, causing heat and possible sparks to ignite the materials covering the vehicle's floorboard, Foster City Fire Department Chief Michael Keefe said at the news conference.

The fire spread to foam padding inside the limo's rear seats, causing black smoke and fire inside the passenger area of the vehicle, Keefe said.

The smoke and fire blocked access to the limo's rear doors, leaving passengers with one exit through a small opening between the passenger area and the driver's compartment, Keefe said.

The investigation also exonerated the limousine driver, Orville Brown, who had been criticized by a surviving passenger for failing to pull over soon enough after smoke was seen in the passenger compartment.

"The tragedy unfolded very, very quickly, and so as soon as Mr. Brown had the opportunity to pull over he did," Keefe said. He said that a review of phone records showed that Brown was not on the phone during the drive.

Limo Stop, the vehicle's owner would not be held accountable for the fire, but a fine of $7,500 would be imposed on the company for allowing the vehicle to carry two more passengers than it had seat belts on the night of the fire, California Public Utilities Commission Director Emory Hagan said.

California Highway Patrol officials plan to work with lawmakers to recommend future safety requirements in limousines, including driver training and secondary exiting, Keefe said.



headline: Lawyer in 9/11 case questions whether U.S. Guantanamo interrogation was voluntary
byline: By Jane Sutton
8:31am EDT

An FBI agent and a U.S. military investigator testified on Monday that a Saudi prisoner accused in the September 11 plot freely and voluntarily answered their questions during an interrogation at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in 2007.

But at the pretrial hearing, a defense attorney for the prisoner, Mustafa al Hawsawi, questioned how voluntary those statements could have been after 4-1/2 years in CIA and U.S. military custody.

The investigators said Hawsawi had not been advised of his right to remain silent, was not allowed to consult a lawyer and was not told that his words could be used against him.

He was told that it was entirely up to him whether to continue with the questioning that took place over four days at the naval base in Cuba, they testified.

"He could stop the conversation at any time," said Stephen McClain, an investigator with the military's Criminal Investigative Task Force. "He could leave the room at any time."

Was he "free to get up and get on a plane and go home?" asked Hawsawi's defense attorney, Navy Lieutenant Commander Walter Ruiz.

McClain acknowledged that he was not.

Hawsawi is an alleged al Qaeda financier accused of providing money, credit cards and Western clothing to the hijackers who commandeered four commercial planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and Pennsylvania field on September 11, 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people.

He was captured in Pakistan in March 2003 and held by the CIA in a series of secret prisons, where he claims to have been tortured during interrogations.

He and four co-defendants were transferred in 2006 to Guantanamo, where they are facing conspiracy, murder and other charges in a U.S. war crimes tribunal that could end with their execution.

Prosecutors want to start the trial in September 2014 but defense attorneys say it could take them three more years or longer to prepare their case.

Any statements that may have been obtained from them via torture or coercion cannot be used as evidence in their trial.

McClain and FBI Special Agent James Fitzgerald were part of a "clean team" that questioned Hawsawi and other prisoners at Guantanamo to prepare the charges.

They said Hawsawi had been "friendly but reserved," during the sessions, which were regularly recessed so he could eat, sleep, pray and use the bathroom.

DISMISSAL SOUGHT

Ruiz has asked the judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, to dismiss the charges against Hawsawi because no interpreter was present when the native speaker of Arabic was questioned in English.

The investigators said Hawsawi spoke English proficiently and seemed to understand them fully.

Hawsawi's statements to the investigators remain classified as top secret.

Ruiz said he had been given a very heavily redacted copy and held up several pages in the courtroom. "They're black pieces of paper," the judge said.

Prosecutors will not give Ruiz and the other defense lawyers unredacted copies of the classified evidence until they sign an agreement promising to safeguard it.

Ruiz and most of the other defense lawyers have refused to do that until the judge resolves their requests for changes and clarifications.

That topic is expected to take up much of the weeklong pretrial hearing that began on Monday at the remote naval base in eastern Cuba.

Monday afternoon's court session was cut short because Yemeni defendant Walid bin Attash became ill.

The judge ruled that since the absence was involuntary, the public part of the hearing could not continue. He said he would reconvene to discuss classified issues in a closed court session, from which the defendants would be excluded anyway.

headline: Singer sues over California attack after Trayvon Martin dedication
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

An African American performer who was shoved after he dedicated a song to slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin at a California music festival filed a lawsuit on Monday against the white woman who he said assaulted him onstage.

Prosecutors have charged Dinalynn Andrews-Potter, 43, with assault and elder abuse stemming from the onstage incident last month as Lester Chambers performed on the day a Florida jury reached a verdict in the racially charged killing.

Chambers, the 73-year-old former lead singer for the Chambers Brothers, had urged the Alameda County district attorney to charge his assailant with a hate crime for shoving him while he was performing a peace-seeking spiritual on July 13 in the northern California city of Hayward.

But investigators determined the incident lacked the racial animus needed to support such charges.

Chambers' civil lawsuit calls the assault "a racially motivated public attack," saying Andrews-Potter attacked Chambers with punched fists and racial slurs. It accuses her and the San Francisco suburb of Hayward, which sponsored the blues festival, with damages for battery, elder abuse, interfering with his exercise of civil rights, negligent supervision and negligence.

The disturbance, captured on video, happened minutes before a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager Martin in a verdict that spurred nationwide protests.

Oakland civil rights attorney John Burris filed the lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on behalf of Chambers, best known for the hit song "Time Has Come Today."

"This was an egregious attack upon an 73-year-old African American blues legend that took place moments after Mr. Chambers had dedicated a song about Martin Luther King ... to the family of Trayvon Martin," he said in an email. "This has all the appearance of a hate crime."

The lawsuit says the attack left Chambers "humiliated and ashamed" and unable to perform for at least eight months.

Video of the performance shows Chambers singing into the microphone with a band backing him up when a woman rushed to the stage, jumped up and shoved him so forcefully he fell backward into sound equipment.

Andrews-Potter could not be reached for comment.



headline: Mexican drug kingpin Eduardo Arellano Felix sentenced to prison in US
byline: By Dan Whitcomb
8:31am EDT

Former Mexican drug kingpin Eduardo Arellano Felix, who pleaded guilty to laundering money for the notorious cartel that bore his family name, was sentenced on Monday in California to 15 years in prison in what law enforcement officials called the end of an era.

With the sentencing in U.S. District Court in San Diego, Arellano Felix, 56, became the last of four brothers killed or sent to prison in connection with the Arellano Felix drug trafficking ring, federal prosecutors said.

"The three living Arellano Felix brothers, who for decades lived as multi-millionaires while terrorizing the Southwest border, ordering assassinations and corrupting countless public officials are now confined to maximum security prison cells for a very long time. I urge others who aspire to take their place to take note," U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said.

The two brothers who authorities say served as leaders of the cartel, Benjamin Arellano Felix and Francisco Javier Arellano Felix, were convicted in the United States on charges of racketeering, drug trafficking and money laundering. Benjamin Arellano Felix was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison and Francisco Javier Arellano Felix was given a life term.

Brother Ramon Arellano Felix, said to be the organization's enforcer, was killed in a shootout with police in 2002.

Eduardo Arellano Felix, nicknamed "El Doctor," pleaded guilty in May to one count of conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds and one count of conspiring to invest that money for the cartel's benefit.

Under his plea deal, he also agreed to forfeit $50 million.

He had faced a maximum of 140 years if convicted of the charges brought against him in an indictment, including racketeering and conspiracy to distribute and import marijuana and cocaine to the United States, although federal sentencing guidelines typically allow for less time. The indictment described him as a senior adviser to his brother Benjamin.

"The sentence that Eduardo Arellano Felix received today marks the end of an era in cartel history. The AFO is finished, others have moved in and are attempting to take their place," William Sherman, special agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in San Diego, said in a statement.

The Arellano Felix organization controlled the drug trade from its base in Tijuana, south of San Diego, between 1986 and 2002. At the height of its power in the 1990s, the cartel smuggled hundreds of millions of dollars in narcotics through a 100-mile-wide corridor stretching from Tijuana to Mexicali, south of Calexico, California.

The brothers gained an added measure of notoriety when the Tijuana cartel and its battle with the rival Juarez cartel were dramatized in the 2000 film "Traffic," which earned four Oscars.

The Mexican government has extradited record numbers of reputed drug kingpins to the United States in recent years while Mexican police and soldiers have rounded up thousands of hit men and smugglers.

But the offensive has led to escalating violence, with more than 70,000 drug-related murders during the six-year term of former President Felipe Calderon, and his efforts were widely condemned as a failure.

His successor, President Enrique Pena Nieto, is keen to rewrite the script, focusing attention on the economy, which has grown at a faster pace than the United States' in the last three years.

called Alphabet Murders.

The panel of six men and six women began weighing the evidence against Joseph Naso, 79, after he delivered his own closing argument at the end of a two-month trial.

Naso could face the death penalty if he is convicted of more than one of the "Alphabet Murders," so named because the first and last name of each victim began with the same letter.

The balding, stooped photographer insisted on defending himself against four first-degree murder charges. He admitted taking pictures of women in nylons and high heels - and boastfully displayed some in court - but maintained he never killed anyone.

"Vague writings, plus photographs, plus dating stories, plus having sex, plus hoarding does not equal murder," said Naso.

He declined to take the witness stand and told the jury he wanted to explain why, but the judge would not allow him to offer a reason.

"What motive do I have to kill anyone?" Naso asked. "I do not have a motive."

The prosecution contends Naso drugged his victims, raped or tried to rape them and then strangled them before dumping their bodies in remote places. Investigators found pictures of two of the slain women in Naso's safety-deposit box and notes about all of the victims on a list prosecutors described as a roster of dumping grounds.

"All four of these women - Pamela Parsons, Tracy Tafoya, Carmen Colon and Roxene Roggasch - are all on the list. Their names aren't there," said Deputy District Attorney Rosemary Slote. But, she said, "Law enforcement was able to use this list as a map."

Investigators began to tie Naso to the murders in 2010, after officers visited his Reno, Nevada, home, while he was on probation for an unrelated felony theft conviction, and discovered ammunition.

A further search turned up what prosecutors have called a list of dumping grounds for 10 victims, handwritten diaries of sexual assaults and hundreds of photographs of scantily clad women, many appearing dead or unconscious.

Naso said prosecutors had no proof that he murdered any of the four women. But he did concede that DNA found in the pantyhose worn by Roggasch when her body was discovered might justify the conclusion he had sex with her.

"All it proves is I may have had sex with her," Naso said. "I don't remember it."

Naso has said he knew only one of the four women, Parsons, who disappeared in 1993. He admitted photographing Parsons in April 1993 and a note in his dairy said she had "ripped him off," Slote said.

On September 13, 1993, the day Parsons went missing, investigators found an entry on Naso's calendar that read: "Got even on an old account," Slote said.

Roggasch, 18, and Colon, 22, were slain in the 1970s. Parsons, 38, and Tafoya, 31, were killed in the 1990s.

DNA on nylons tied around Roggasch's neck matched Naso's ex-wife's, and DNA in Colon's fingernail clippings matched Naso's.

headline: Detroit union files challenge to city's bankruptcy petition
byline: By Joseph Lichterman and Bernie Woodall
8:31am EDT

One of Detroit's biggest public labor unions on Monday became the first major party to file an objection to the city's bankruptcy filing ahead of a midnight deadline for challenges.

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 25 said Detroit, which last month filed for what would be the largest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy, has not proven it is insolvent and has not negotiated in good faith with its creditors. In a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Detroit, the union said it was also challenging the constitutionality of Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code, which governs municipal bankruptcies, arguing that it encroaches on states' rights.

The union also said Michigan's emergency manager law, which enabled Detroit to file for bankruptcy on July 18, violates the state constitution because the law does not explicitly protect retirement benefits for public workers.

With the clock ticking toward the deadline set by U.S. Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing Detroit's case, objections were expected to be filed by a range of creditors, including the city's public-employee pension funds, bondholders, bond insurers, vendors, retirees and possibly hundreds of smaller parties.

For Detroit's Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy to proceed, Rhodes must first find that the city has proven it is insolvent and negotiated in good faith with its creditors, or that there were too many creditors to make negotiations feasible.

In a court filing earlier this month, Detroit released a list of creditors, including current, former and retired workers, that filled 3,504 pages. Another filing by Kevyn Orr, Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, said that "further negotiations with all of the city's various stakeholders is impracticable."

Orr's filing included a litany of Detroit's financial woes, including more than $18 billion in debt and other obligations, with nearly $12 billion of that amount considered unsecured.

Detroit, a former manufacturing powerhouse and cradle of the U.S. automotive industry and Motown music, has struggled for decades as companies moved or closed, crime surged and its population fell from a peak of 1.8 million in the 1950s to around 700,000 currently. The city's revenue fell short of spending, while its budgets and borrowing ballooned.

Orr's spokesman, Bill Nowling, said the emergency manager will respond "specifically and completely" to the objections in court.

"Mr. Orr believes he has surpassed the legal standard of negotiating in good faith with creditors and stakeholders," Nowling said. "He submitted a proposed restructuring plan to creditors on June 14."

About 50 individuals filed objections to the bankruptcy at the federal court in Detroit Monday morning. The group was organized by the Detroit chapter of the National Action Network, a national civil rights organization founded by Rev. Al Sharpton.

The group's objection cites potential constitutional problems with a Michigan law that allowed for the bankruptcy filing and claims that the judge did not allow enough time for objection filings.

Rev. Charles Williams II, the chapter's president, said many residents, himself included, received notice only last week that they were parties of interest who could object to the city's filing.

"The process hasn't been as clear and transparent as it should have," Williams said. "Many Detroit residents received letters giving them the opportunity to file for an objection and they didn't even know they received it. They weren't properly notified."

Rhodes has scheduled October 23 for the start of a hearing to determine if Detroit is eligible to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9. If Detroit is deemed eligible for municipal bankruptcy, it would be the biggest such case in U.S. history.

Detroit's largest unsecured creditors are its two pension funds, which have claims totaling $3.74 billion in estimated unfunded liabilities, according to a court filing by the city.

The remainder of the city's top 20 creditors include bondholders of $1.47 billion of certificates of participation that Detroit sold for its pension funds and hundreds of million dollars of general obligation bonds.

The Detroit Institute of Arts said on Monday it will not file an objection to the bankruptcy. The DIA has become embroiled in the city's case because its assets, which include works by Van Gogh and Matisse, could be sold to pay Detroit's debt. However, Orr has said he hopes he does not have to sell DIA assets.

Rhodes on Monday appointed Chicago attorney Robert Fishman as the fee examiner in the case. Fishman will ensure all fees charged to the city are disclosed and are not exorbitant. Fee examiners are typical in corporate bankruptcies, but according to a search of the Westlaw legal database, it appears Rhodes is the first judge to appoint one in a Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy.

While Orr has expressed a desire for the city to emerge from bankruptcy by September 2014, a lengthy eligibility fight could extend the time frame.

Stockton, California, took nearly a year just to prove it could stay in bankruptcy court, and San Bernardino, California, is still awaiting a declaration more than a year after filing for protection.

Some local governments have lost their eligibility fights. A judge in Bridgeport, Connecticut's 1991 bankruptcy found the city was not insolvent, while Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's 2011 petition did not survive because state lawmakers passed legislation barring the city's filing and a judge threw it out.



headline: Lawyers for WikiLeaker Manning ask judge not to 'rob him of his youth'
byline: By Medina Roshan
8:31am EDT

Attorneys for Bradley Manning, the soldier found guilty of turning over 700,000 classified U.S. files to WikiLeaks, called on a military judge on Monday to sentence him to a term that "doesn't rob him of his youth," rather than the 60 years urged by prosecutors.

Manning, 25, was working as a low-level intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2010 when he committed the largest unauthorized release of secret documents in U.S. history, catapulting pro-transparency website WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, into the international spotlight.

"Perhaps his biggest crime was that he cared about the loss of life and that he couldn't ignore it," defense attorney David Coombs said during closing arguments of the sentencing part of Manning's court martial at Fort Meade, Maryland.

"This court has had a year and half to see the conduct of PFC Manning. He's a little geeky at times. But he's caring, he's compassionate," Coombs said. "This is a young man who is capable of being redeemed. We should not rob him of his youth."

Earlier on Monday, prosecutor Captain Joe Morrow told Judge Colonel Denise Lind, "He betrayed the United States."

"For that betrayal he deserves to spend the majority of his remaining life in prison," Morrow said.

In July, Lind found the Army private first class guilty of 20 criminal charges including espionage, which carry a possible prison sentence of up to 90 years. She found him not guilty of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, which could have carried a penalty of life in prison without parole.

Prosecuting attorneys contended during the trial that when Manning turned over the secret documents he had put national security, including overseas intelligence operatives, at risk. They argued and witnesses testified that the slightly built soldier had hoped to spark a broader debate on the role of the U.S. military.

According to defense testimony during the trial, military supervisors ignored bizarre acts by Manning that included trying to grab a gun during a counseling session. Defense attorneys had argued that such actions showed Manning was not fit for duty overseas.

Morrow argued that the military was not to blame for Manning's actions.

"It wasn't the military's fault. It wasn't because he saw something horrible. It was because he had an agenda. It matters that he took an oath and he knowingly broke it," Morrow said. "The Army didn't abandon PFC Manning. PFC Manning abandoned the Army."

On Tuesday, Judge Lind is expected to begin deliberating the length of Manning's sentence, which will likely be served in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Manning's trial is winding down at the same time the United States is seeking the return of Edward Snowden, a former CIA contractor who disclosed details of a number of secret U.S. programs that included monitoring Americans' telephone and Internet traffic. Snowden has been given temporary asylum in Russia.

Manning has won support from some Americans for his acts, with one rights group saying he should be a candidate for this year's Nobel Peace Prize.

Earlier this year, Manning pleaded guilty to lesser charges but military prosecutors continued their effort to convict him on more serious counts.

Manning addressed the court last Wednesday, telling the judge he was "sorry" for his actions.

"I understand I must pay a price for my decisions," he said.

headline: Sandy task force suggests ways to handle future superstorms
byline: By Noreen O'Donnell
8:31am EDT

A U.S. task force on rebuilding after Superstorm Sandy listed dozens of recommendations on Monday to help protect communities from rising sea levels and increasingly intense storms.

Among the 69 proposals included in its report, the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force suggested improvements to the electrical grid and communication systems so they are less likely to fail in a storm and urged that the fuel supply chain be protected.

It recommended that governments and residents be given the best scientific data available on current and future risks, including a Web-based tool that uses federal agency information to project how high sea levels will rise, up to 100 years in the future.

"More than ever, it is critical that when we build for the future, we do so in a way that makes communities more resilient to emerging challenges such as rising sea levels, extreme heat and more frequent and intense storms," the report said.

It was released at a joint press conference by the task force chairman, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

President Barack Obama created the task force in December, months after the October 2012 storm devastated New York, New Jersey and other parts of the East Coast. Sandy killed at least 159 people, and damaged or destroyed more than 650,000 homes, leading to private insurance claims of $19 billion.

It knocked out subways, roads and bridges, and more than 9 million people lost power. In all, at least $30 billion to $50 billion in economic activity was lost.

"And we all remember the gas lines and generators sitting idle due to a lack of fuel, bringing the region and the economy to a standstill," Donovan said.

The task force found that a major focus should be protecting critical infrastructure.

Every dollar spent on hazard mitigation would save the country at least $4 if another disaster struck, Donovan said.

The U.S. Congress in January approved an emergency aid package of about $50 billion for areas devastated by the October 2012 superstorm. The Federal Emergency Management Agency alone has provided more than $12 billion in assistance, Donovan said. More assistance will be announced in coming weeks through federal Community Development Block Grants, he said.

"We are not just focused on speeding relief to families and communities," Donovan said. "We're also focused on protecting communities from the risks of a changing climate."

A competition called "Rebuild by Design," in which teams of architects and engineers address the risks, could deliver innovative ideas for rebuilding in the region, the report said. Other recommendations include:

- Helping victims stay in their homes by allowing quick emergency repairs.

- Providing consistent guidance on remediating indoor pollutants such as mold.

- Reforming the National Flood Insurance Program so that homeowners are not priced out of their homes.

- Making it easier for small businesses to access federal contracts for rebuilding.



headline: Elderly son of heiress Brooke Astor to plea for parole
byline: By Francesca Trianni
8:31am EDT

old son, in prison for swindling his late philanthropist mother, is slated to appear before the New York State Parole Board this week to seek an early medical release, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman said on Monday.

Anthony Marshall, convicted in 2009 of grand larceny and other charges for taking advantage of his aging mother, suffers from Parkinson's disease and is unable to walk or feed himself, according to his lawyers.

He began serving his sentence on June 21.

A decorated veteran from the Second World War, Broadway producer and U.S. diplomat, he has been serving his one- to three-year sentence in a medical unit at Fishkill Correctional Facility, about 70 miles north of New York City.

To be eligible for medical parole, inmates must be "so physically or cognitively debilitated or incapacitated that there is a reasonable probability" that they no longer present any danger to society, according to the state Department of Corrections.

The department did not release a specific date for the parole hearing, but a decision on whether to grant Marshall medical parole will be made before this Friday, said spokeswoman Linda Foglia.

Marshall's lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.

Marshall was convicted of taking advantage of his mother's deteriorating mental state and stealing millions of dollars from her the years before she died at the age of 105 in 2007. The thrice-married Astor was a philanthropist for much of her life, heading the Vincent Astor Foundation for almost 40 years.

If Marshall is denied parole, his earliest potential release date would be June 2014, said Foglia. If he is granted parole, his release might take several weeks.

Since New York's compassionate release law took effect in 1992, 398 inmates have been granted medical parole, Foglia said.

Last year, 11 inmates received parole under the law, six with terminal illnesses and five with non-terminal illnesses, she said.



headline: Career Education settles New York probe of job placement rates
byline: By Jonathan Stempel
8:31am EDT

profit education company was accused of inflating job placement rates to attract prospective students to its schools.

The settlement was announced on Monday by Eric Schneiderman, the state's attorney general.

New York accused Career Education of inflating job placement rates from 2009 through the spring of 2011, disclosing annual placement rates of 54.9 percent to 80.2 percent that should have instead been 24.1 percent to 64.1 percent.

The settlement requires Career Education to make $9.25 million in restitution to students, pay a $1 million penalty, hire an independent company to verify placement rates for three years and change what employment qualifies as placements.

Career Education did not admit or deny the state's findings, but Schneiderman said the Schaumberg, Illinois-based company fired several high-level managers involved in inflating placement rates and took steps to modify its practices.

Mark Spencer, a spokesman for Career Education, said the settlement "closes an important chapter and allows us to move forward with a heightened focus on student outcomes, including our critically important job placement services."

Career Education said it has more than 90 campuses serving roughly 57,600 students. The New York probe focused on activity at seven campuses and two online institutions.

The state said Career Education inflated placement rates through such means as counting employment at one-day "health fairs," and the employment of criminal justice graduates in retail sales and data processing.

It cited one example in which a criminal justice graduate who processed parking ticket data was credited as having obtained a "related field" placement because the graduate's duties involving dealing "with the courts."

"Students pay thousands of dollars to for-profit colleges because they rightly believe education is the ticket to success in their careers," Schneiderman said in a statement. "That's why it's so unfortunate that this company exploited students' aspirations and published misleading information."

In a regulatory filing this month, Career Education said other regulators, including Illinois' attorney general and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have inquired about its placement rate practices, and that it is cooperating. It also said it had set aside $10 million to cover a settlement with New York.

Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Schneiderman, confirmed that the New York attorney general's office has open investigations of practices at other for-profit schools.



headline: Supporters of embattled San Diego mayor rally amid report of talks
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

Supporters of San Diego Mayor Bob Filner protested on Monday what they said were unfair attempts to oust him over sexual harassment accusations, amid reports that the mayor's lawyers were negotiating a possible end to the political standoff.

The rally by some 100 people came on the first day that Filner, who has resisted mounting pressure to resign in the face of allegations of unwanted sexual advances by 16 women, was due back at work following a leave of absence to seek therapy.

Filner was not seen at his City Hall offices by early afternoon, and local media reported he had gone into a downtown San Diego office building where negotiations were under way between his lawyers and attorneys for former aide Irene McCormack Jackson, who sued him for sexual harassment in July.

Local KCBS8-TV, reported that Filner was seen entering the office at about 9 a.m., followed about 45 minutes later by Jackson and her attorney, Gloria Allred.

Local 10News, citing two unnamed sources, reported that Filner's attorneys were in mediation with Allred and City Attorney Jan Goldsmith. Reuters could not immediately confirm those reports, and neither Filner's representatives nor Allred could immediately be reached for comment.

During the demonstration, Filner's supporters complained that the 70-year-old veteran politician had been denied due process by those seeking his removal from office.

The allegations have prompted nearly every elected official of both parties in San Diego, California's second-largest city, to call on Filner to resign, along with the San Diego County Democratic Central Committee.

But the mayor has so far refused to stand down. Instead, he has publicly apologized for what he has acknowledged was a pattern of disrespectful and intimidating treatment of women and took a brief leave of absence to enter behavior modification therapy at an undisclosed clinic.

His lawyers say he has since left the clinic but was taking some additional time off last week before returning to work.

On Sunday, volunteers began collecting signatures seeking to force a recall election for Filner. They will need to amass at least 102,000 valid signatures within 39 days, by September 26, to qualify a recall vote for the ballot, a deadline that some experts have said would be difficult to meet.

But Michael Pallamary, a local Republican activist who helped spearhead the bipartisan campaign, said the effort got off to a brisk start with volunteers collecting many thousands of signatures during the first day spent circulating petitions.



headline: New York City announces largest gun seizure in its history
byline: By Chris Francescani
8:31am EDT

New York City authorities on Monday trumpeted the largest gun seizure in city history, capturing 254 weapons and arresting 19 people from smuggling rings that are accused of running guns northward from the Carolinas.

"There is no doubt that the seizure of these guns has saved lives," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told a news conference, using the opportunity to defend the New York Police Department's controversial "stop and frisk" tactic, which a U.S. judge last week ruled was unconstitutional.

Two smuggling rings are alleged to have acquired guns that had been stolen or purchased illegally in North Carolina and South Carolina, taking advantage of a premium on guns in New York due to stricter gun control laws, New York City Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan told reporters.

"The marketing strategy was very simple," said Brennan. "Buy low, sell high and keep a low profile."

The grand jury indictments, which include 552 counts against the 19 defendants, were unsealed on Monday.

For years, Bloomberg and NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly have decried what is known in law enforcement circles as the "iron pipeline" - a gun smuggling route on the U.S. East Coast, moving guns from states with more lax firearms laws, such as those in North Carolina and South Carolina, up to New York and other Northeast states, where black-market guns fetch at least three times their retail price.

Flanked on either side of the podium by long folding tables lined with handguns, semi-automatic weapons, and at least one assault rifle, authorities identified the two lead suspects as: Walter Walker, 29, of Sanford, North Carolina; and Earl Campbell, 24, of Rock Hill, South Carolina.

The names of their attorneys were not immediately available.

Each was arrested in his home state earlier this month. While the pair are accused of running separate gun-running operations, police tied them together through the same middleman, who officials said ran a music recording studio in Brooklyn.

According to Kelly, Campbell shifted sales from Brooklyn to Manhattan earlier this year out of fear of being caught up in the NYPD's "stop and frisk" police stops in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, one of the city's high-crime neighborhoods.

"I can't take them (guns) to my house ... 'cause I'm in Brownsville," Kelly quoted Campbell as saying in a January phone call captured on a wiretap. "We got, like, whatchamacallit, stop and frisk."

A U.S. district judge last week ruled "stop and frisk" unconstitutional for unfairly targeting of minorities and ordered changes to the tactic. [ID:nL2N0GD0GY] The city has appealed the ruling, saying the practice has helped reduce crime by 30 percent.



headline: Both sides assemble in U.S. 'Baby Veronica' adoption case
byline: By Heide Handes
8:31am EDT

Supporters of both sides in a dispute over the adoption of a Native American girl known as "Baby Veronica" held separate rallies in Oklahoma just days after adoptive and birth parents agreed to mediation to resolve the custody battle.

Some of those supporting Dusten Brown, the biological father of the girl who is fighting to keep her from going back to an adoptive family in South Carolina, rallied on Monday at the Oklahoma State Capitol in Oklahoma City.

Sarah Adams-Cornell, an organizer of the rally said it highlighted the Indian Child Welfare Act, a federal law passed in 1978, that attempts to give Native American tribes control over their children.

The law was meant to end decades of abuse during which many tribal children were taken away and raised by non-Native families or in boarding schools where they were sometimes not allowed to speak their indigenous languages.

A separate prayer vigil supporting Veronica's adoptive parents, Matt and Melanie Capobianco, was held Sunday in Tulsa, and organizers also prayed for the Brown family.

On Friday, the two sides agreed to mediation, although details of any negotiations over custody of the girl were shrouded under a judge's gag order in Cherokee County Court.

The case has highlighted overlapping parental claims in two states, and the clash between a Native American culture seeking to protect children from being adopted outside their tribes and U.S. legal safeguards for adoptive parents. The situation has become so emotionally wrenching that the governors in Oklahoma and South Carolina have spoken on the phone about it and are pushing for a resolution outside of the court.

Veronica's birth mother, who is not Native American, arranged the adoption with the Capobiancos before the girl was born. Veronica lived with them after her birth in 2009. Brown intervened in 2010 before the adoption process was final, and a South Carolina family court ordered that Veronica be turned over to Brown in December 2011.

Brown has argued that when he turned over parental rights to the girl's mother, he did not realize she would put the child up for adoption.

Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation who was not married to the birth mother, argued that the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 allowed him to have Veronica, who is 3/256th Cherokee.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the ruling and decided the act did not apply in Veronica's situation. The adoption by the Capobiancos was finalized in South Carolina in July.

But Brown refused to give up Veronica and was arrested on August 12 in Oklahoma on a charge of "custodial interference." The Capobiancos have said they are willing to compromise with a resolution that allows Veronica to maintain a relationship with her Oklahoma family.



headline: U.S. courts grapple with budget cuts for defense lawyers
byline: By Nate Raymond and Emily Flitter
8:31am EDT

Faced with steep budget cuts, the U.S. federal court system on Monday slashed $15 an hour from the fees it pays private lawyers to represent poor criminal defendants.

The Judicial Conference of the United States said it would cut rates for non-capital cases to $110 an hour from $125. For death penalty cases, the rate drops to $163 an hour from $178.

Judge William Traxler of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a letter announcing the cuts that the action and other budget reductions were "necessary to avoid permanent damage to the federal defender program."

U.S. federal courts have lost $345.6 million from this year's budget as a result of across-the-board cuts called the sequester.

The cuts prompted a group of 87 judges to send a letter last week to Vice President Joe Biden and House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner detailing the impact of the sequester.

The biggest impact was a nearly $52 million hit to court-appointed lawyers for criminal defendants who can't afford them, a service that is required under the U.S. Constitution, the letter said.

Since October 2012, federal defenders offices have reduced their staffing by 6 percent, or 160 people, according to the letter. Remaining employees have been furloughed on average 15 days each over the last half of the fiscal year, it said.

In their place, the courts have been increasingly turning to the private lawyers who cost 20 percent more than salaried federal defenders, before taking into account the cuts announced on Monday.

The sequester is "not saving money, it's costing money," said David Patton, the executive director for the Federal Defenders of New York, which staffs cases in courts covering Manhattan and Brooklyn.

But the fee cuts and related cost-saving measures will provide for $49.8 million in estimated savings from September 2013 through September 2014, courts officials say.

The cuts to public defender spending have been cited in some high-profile cases. In one, the federal defender's office in New York sought to delay the terrorism trial of Suleiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of Osama bin Laden, because of staff cutbacks.

U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the case, said at a hearing in April it was "extremely troublesome to contemplate a case of this nature to be delayed because of sequestration."

Robert Anello, the president of a lawyer group called the Federal Bar Council, expressed concern that the steps to deal with the sequester could threaten defendant's rights to a lawyer.

"It's just moving around crumbs of an ever shrinking pie," he said. "There's only so much moving you can do without dismantling the whole system."

The $15 hourly cut could result in some lawyers who were already accepting reduced rates to decline appointments, said Jeffrey "Chip" Frensley, a Tennessee lawyer who acts as the chief representative to the courts for private attorneys.

"The fee cut is just really an extremely disappointing situation," he said.

called conversion therapy.

The state senate approved the measure in June, putting it on the desk of Christie, who is seeking re-election this fall and also widely considered a White House contender for the Republican Party in 2016.

Citing medical and psychiatric research that sexual orientation is determined at birth, the law bans state-licensed counselors, therapists and social workers from practicing a method of talk therapy that opponents have said is deeply damaging to the self-esteem and identity of gay youths.

Christie said he was signing the legislation based on research that found "efforts to change sexual orientation can pose critical health risks, including, but not limited to, depression, substance abuse, social withdrawal, decreased self-esteem and suicidal thoughts."

But he said he still had "concerns about government limiting parental choice on the care and treatment of their own children."

Former New Jersey Democratic Governor Jim McGreevey, who stepped down from office in 2004 in a gay sex scandal, praised the measure, saying it was based in "sound psychiatric research."

"Governor Christie should really be applauded," McGreevey told Reuters. "Whenever a governor of his stature signs a bill like this, it sends a message, not just to the nation but to the individual child that you are normal and as God made you."

New Jersey becomes the second state after California to outlaw conversion therapy for people under age 18. However, the California measure has yet to take effect because of a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality.

Opponents of the New Jersey law have promised a legal fight as well.

John Tomicki of the League of American Families said both the New Jersey and California laws infringed on a parent's right to decide the best treatment for his or her child.

Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, a gay rights group and leading proponent of the measure, said there were moves to ban the practice in Massachusetts and New York. "There's a huge push to ban this kind of abuse nationally," Stevenson added.

Conversion therapy has become increasingly controversial. In June, California-based Exodus International, a Christian group championing it, apologized for the harm it caused and said it was shutting its doors after 38 years.



headline: Judge blocks Oklahoma law on "Plan B" emergency contraception
byline: By Carey Gillam
8:31am EDT

A judge in Oklahoma issued a temporary restraining order on Monday blocking implementation of a law that critics said would limit a woman's access to emergency contraception known as the "morning after pill," court records showed.

"Once again Oklahoma politicians' efforts to turn back the clock on women's health and rights have been blocked," David Brown, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in an emailed statement.

The Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice sued the Oklahoma State Board of Pharmacy and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt on August 8, claiming the law violated Oklahoma's constitution and put up barriers for women who wanted to use legal contraception.

The order was issued by State District Court Judge Lisa Davis.

The law, signed by Republican Governor Mary Fallin on May 29, included a provision requiring women 17 years of age and older to show identification to a pharmacist to obtain Plan B One-Step contraception, commonly called the morning after pill, and requiring those under 17 to have a prescription for it.

There was no immediate response to a request for comment from the governor's office or the state pharmacy board.

Diane Clay, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Pruitt, said in a statement, "The law simply keeps requirements the same as they have been for more than a decade, requiring those under age 17 to have a prescription to buy Plan B emergency contraceptives."

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the Plan B One-Step for over-the-counter sales on June 20 with no age or point-of-sale restrictions and no identification requirements for purchase.

Plan B One-Step is marketed as an emergency contraceptive that can help prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours after birth control failure or unprotected sex. It has been a point of contention for years between abortion rights groups and abortion opponents.



headline: Teenage surfer survives shark attack off Hawaii's Big Island

foot shark in the second such attack in the state in less than a week, but the teen's mother said on Monday he is expected to make a full recovery.

The young victim, Jimmy Ulualoha "Ulu-boy" Nateahi, suffered 30 deep lacerations in the attack, which occurred while he was surfing on Sunday with friends at Pohoiki Bay. His mother was beckoning him to get out of the water, she said.

Claire Nateahi, speaking to Reuters by telephone from her son's hospital room in Hilo, the Big Island's main town, recalled that he had a plane to catch that day for a flight to Oahu, where he was to compete in a surfing contest.

As she waved for him to come back to shore, Jimmy shouted to her, "'One more wave, one more wave,' and that's when it happened," she said.

His mother recounted seeing the boy's friends converge around him in the water, and from shore she and other onlookers "could see the shark going through the wave," apparently after it had struck. His friends pulled the bleeding teenager onto his surf board and quickly paddled him to shore.

"I didn't know it was him, but then everyone else stood up, and he didn't," Claire Nateahi said. "I didn't want it to be him."

Jimmy was flown by helicopter to Hilo Medical Center, where he was listed in satisfactory condition on Sunday night, said William Aila, chairman of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

He is expected to recover fully, his mother said. "He'll be able to surf again after he heals," she said. "He's going to recover and he's going to go back. ... Absolutely, it's been his passion his whole life. He's been surfing since he was four."

SECOND ATTACK IN A WEEK

Jimmy Nateahi did not speak to Reuters, but when his mother asked him how big the shark was, he could be heard in the background replying, "8 to 10 feet." The type of shark was not immediately known, but the teenager told his mother it was gray in color.

Asked how she felt about sharks after the attack on her son, the boy's mother said, "It's their territory. It's their home. We've got to share the ocean with them."

Aila said the incident marks the ninth shark attack on a person in Hawaiian waters this year. Last Wednesday, a shark bit off the arm of a 20-year-old woman from Germany who was snorkeling in Maui, he said.

Hawaii typically documents five or six close encounters between people and sharks every year, including bites or cases in which a shark may actually bump into or brush up against someone, he said. Fatal attacks in Hawaii are rare, the last one occurring several years ago, Aila said.

The latest attack occurred at one of the few areas along the rocky Pohoiki coast that are suitable for surfing, Aila said. Hawaiian television station KHON-TV reported that the boy was attacked at a surfing spot called Dead Trees in Pohoiki Bay.

Beaches along the Pohoiki shore were closed to the public after the incident as a precaution and will remain closed until after the area is surveyed by helicopter and determined to be safe, said Hawaii County Deputy Fire Chief Renwick Victorino.

headline: Subpoena extended for reporter's sources on Colorado rampage
byline: By Keith Coffman
8:31am EDT

A Colorado judge on Monday extended a subpoena compelling a Fox News journalist to divulge confidential sources she cited in a story about accused movie theater gunman James Holmes' plans to commit mass murder.

Arapahoe County District Court Judge William Sylvester, in a largely procedural hearing, continued the subpoena for New York-based reporter Jana Winter through late September. The subpoena, which Winter is fighting, had been due to expire on Monday.

Public defenders have accused the government of leaking information to Winter in violation of a court-imposed gag order in place at the time and are demanding that prosecutors be sanctioned, arguing that her article, published online on FoxNews.com, undermined their client's right to a fair trial.

Holmes' defense obtained the subpoena in a bid to force Winter to reveal her sources. Winter says she is protected by Colorado and New York state reporter shield laws.

Holmes, 25, is charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder for the July 2012 shooting spree at a suburban Denver cinema that killed 12 moviegoers and wounded or injured dozens more during a midnight screening of the Batman film "A Dark Knight Rises."

Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if the former University of Colorado neuroscience graduate student is convicted.

Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His lawyers have said in court filings that the California native was "in the throes of a psychotic episode" when he went on the shooting spree.

Citing unnamed law enforcement officials in a story published five days after the massacre, Winter reported that Holmes had mailed a package to his psychiatrist in advance that contained a notebook with diagrams and other entries detailing plans for the shooting rampage. The psychiatrist never saw the package, which arrived after the shooting and was intercepted.

Holmes is undergoing a psychiatric examination at the state's mental hospital, and his lawyers waived his right to appear at Monday's proceeding.

At an earlier court hearing, several law enforcement officers who saw the package in question denied under oath that they were Winter's sources.

Another Colorado judge has said that if Winter were to affirm under oath - without revealing her sources - that none of the officers who testified were the source, that could influence his decision on whether to quash the subpoena.

Prosecutors have been largely silent on the issue.

martial for shooting dead 13 fellow soldiers.

Judge Colonel Tara Osborn barred testimony about the correspondence between Hasan and Awlaki, the U.S.-born militant who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, and with other militants.

Hasan, acting as his own defense attorney, has admitted he opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, on November 5, 2009, killing 13 and wounding 31, saying he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war on Islam.

The judge banned some evidence dating to 2005, declaring it "too remote and subject to multiple interpretations." She also blocked another exchange as a "waste of time and unfair prejudice."

"Motive is not an element of crime, but can be relative to establish premeditation," Osborn said, telling prosecutors they could use evidence from the days closer to the shooting, such as Hasan's internet searches and emails.

Hasan could face the death penalty if all 13 officers on the jury find him guilty of premeditated murder.

The judge repeatedly reminded Hasan he would be better represented by a defense attorney, saying even a trained lawyer should not represent himself.

Hasan confirmed he understood and said he would continue as his own counsel.

More than 75 witnesses have testified in the court-martial over the past two weeks, many describing in horrific detail the bloodbath in and around a medical building at Fort Hood November 5, 2009.

Hasan, who was shot and paralyzed upon his arrest, attends court in a wheelchair and has rarely cross-examined witnesses. He has listed two potential defense witnesses for his case, which could start as soon as Tuesday.



headline: Idaho wildfire rages into 12th day near Sun Valley ski resort
byline: By Laura Zuckerman
8:31am EDT

class ski resort of Sun Valley.

Part of the firefighting assault on Monday, day 12 of the so-called Beaver Creek blaze in central Idaho, focused on the famed ski slopes of Bald Mountain, where snow-making water cannons have been saturating the hills.

Ground crews backed by bulldozers and helicopters dumping payloads of flame retardant worked to reinforce an extensive fire break running from the top of the mountain down its southeastern face to keep the blaze from advancing into the adjacent tourist town of Ketchum.

"That's our insurance policy for Ketchum," fire information officer Rudy Evenson said. From a distance, parts of the slope were stained red from the slurry drops.

Elite firefighting teams armed with hand tools and chain saws battled to knock back a flank of the fire south of Ketchum that posed the greatest immediate threat to the community.

Farther south, authorities lifted mandatory evacuation orders for 400 homes in four neighborhoods near the larger resort town of Hailey. But Blaine County Sheriff Gene Ramsey warned returning residents they should be prepared to flee again at a moment's notice.

Firefighters seized on the opportunity to keep up their aggressive attack as calmer winds and higher humidity prevailed for a second day, contributing to diminished flames.

The fire has charred some 104,000 acres of parched sagebrush, grasslands and pine forests in the Sawtooth National Forest since it was sparked by lightning on August 7.

More than 1,100 firefighters have been assigned to the blaze, whose ever-shifting nature has vexed fire managers. Containment, the portion of the blaze's perimeter firmly enclosed by fire breaks, remained at less than 10 percent.

AREA CONTAINS CELEBRITY HOMES

Beth Lund, incident commander with the U.S. Forest Service team managing the blaze, expressed cautious optimism on Sunday about prospects for gaining control over the blaze.

"I think we're getting to the point where we can start making some progress rather than just be on the defensive," she said. "But when Mother Nature feels she has the upper hand, she keeps it for a while."

At its peak, the blaze was threatening more than 5,000 residences, 1,400 commercial structures and some 3,700 outbuildings, forcing the evacuation of at least 2,250 homes in posh developments outlying Sun Valley, Ketchum and Hailey.

Authorities put the value of endangered land and property in the region, known as the Wood River Valley, at roughly $8 billion. The area contains homes belonging to celebrities such as film director Steven Spielberg, actor Tom Hanks and singer and actress Barbra Streisand.

The blaze has spewed thick smoke over an area prized for scenic views, mountain lakes and a river teeming with wild trout.

Scores of residents and tourists fled over the weekend from Sun Valley and Ketchum, where streets - and many homes - were largely deserted after authorities issued stand-by notices for possible evacuations there on Friday night.

The Beaver Creek fire is one of dozens raging across several western states in a fire season that has already brought substantial property losses and a higher-than-normal number of firefighter deaths, including 19 in a single Arizona blaze.



headline: Sentencing phase to open for U.S. soldier guilty of Afghan murders
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

martial of a U.S. soldier who pleaded guilty in June to the massacre of 16 Afghan civilians was due to hear arguments on Monday over rules for the sentencing proceedings that open this week in Washington state.

Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales' lawyers argued last week that prosecutors' exposure to statements he made during a psychiatric exam â&euro;&rdquo; after the judge mistakenly furnished them with a copy â&euro;&rdquo; compromised their client's constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination.

Defense lawyers cited the mistake as the basis for a motion to remove the prosecution team from the sentencing phase of Bales' court martial at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma.

The judge, Army Colonel Jeffery Nance, rejected that motion last week, agreeing with the prosecution that seeing a document was not equivalent to using it against a defendant, and that the error would not preclude Bales from receiving a fair trial.

On Monday, Nance was set to hear arguments from both sides on procedural rules that should be followed to avoid prejudicing the outcome of the sentencing phase.

In a deal with prosecutors that spares him the death penalty, Bales pleaded guilty in June to walking off his base in Afghanistan's Kandahar province before dawn on March 11, 2012, and killing 16 unarmed civilians, most of them women and children, in attacks on their family compounds.

The slayings marked the worst case of civilian slaughter blamed on a single, rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.

The sentencing hearings, due to begin with the selection of a new jury on Tuesday, will determine whether Bales will be eligible for parole or spend the rest of his life in prison. Defense lawyer John Henry Browne has said he expects the proceedings to last between seven and 10 days.

Military lawyers for the prosecution last week told Nance they had given him a DVD of their case a day before mistakenly receiving the mental health evaluation and had provided him summaries of statements that prosecution witnesses were expected to make during the sentencing phase.

If anything the prosecution presents to the jury deviates from this, they argued, the judge could demand that prosecutors show it was not based upon the inadmissible statements Bales made to military doctors.

Bales, a decorated veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, acknowledged the killings upon pleading guilty in June and told the court there was "not a good reason in this world" for his actions.

Defense attorneys have argued that Bales, a father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his deployment to Afghanistan.



headline: Historic train reopens in scenic California redwoods after tunnel collapse
byline: By Laila Kearney

in tunnel derailed the operation earlier this year.

Train owners spent months rebuilding the tunnel, which collapsed under the pressure of a massive rock, forcing the closure of the California Western Railroad, which had run continuously for 128 years, train manager Robert Pinoli said.

"This is living, breathing history," Pinoli said, adding that train staff was excited the popular tourist attraction was ready to roll again.

The train, known as the Skunk Train, operates on 40 miles of railroad that connects Fort Bragg on the Mendocino Coast to the city of Willits, inland in Mendocino County on the highway 101 corridor.

It uses a 1925 M-100 railcruiser, which is believed to be the only such train in use today, in its collection of vintage locomotives, Pinoli said.

The train carries roughly 50,000 passengers each year and generates $20 million in annual tourism spending in Mendocino County, Pinoli said.

Tourism, Mendocino's primary industry, produced $124 million for the county in 2008, according to the most recent study available from the Center for Economic Development at California State University, Chico.

The Skunk Train received its nickname in 1925, when the California Western Railroad began using gas-fueled railcars, instead of steam-powered engines, and potbellied stoves for heat.

The combination of smells from the gas and stoves created an aroma similar to skunk spray, Pinoli said.

"The old timers said that these rail buses were like skunks," Pinoli said, adding, "You could smell them before you could see them because of their pungent odor."

Noted American merchant Charles R. Johnson funded Skunk Train in 1885 to transport logs and carry families and workers who setup logging camps along the railroad route.

The train was operated for many years by a union lumber company and was sold in the 1960s to Arizona-based Kyle Railways. A group of local investors have owned the train since purchasing it in 1996.

Today, residents who live along the remote Skunk Train route still ride the train to and from home, Pinoli said. The train will unload at individual homes and campsites.

"If you can believe it, in 2013, people still depend on this railroad to get in and out of their summer homes or their year-round homes," Pinoli said.



headline: Britain detains partner of journalist linked to Snowden
byline: By William James
8:31am EDT

terrorism powers on Sunday to detain the partner of a journalist with close links to Edward Snowden, the former U.S. spy agency contractor who has been granted asylum by Russia, as he passed through London's Heathrow airport.

The 28-year-old David Miranda, a Brazilian citizen and partner of U.S. journalist Glenn Greenwald who writes for Britain's Guardian newspaper, was questioned for nine hours before being released without charge, a report on the Guardian website said.

A British Metropolitan Police Service spokesman said a 28-year-old male had been detained at Heathrow airport under provisions of the 2000 Terrorism Act. That law gives British border officials the right to question someone "to determine if that individual is a person concerned in the commission, preparation or execution of acts of terrorism."

Snowden faces criminal charges in the United States after leaking documents disclosing previously secret U.S. internet and telephone surveillance programs. Russia rejected American pleas to send Snowden back to the United States for trial, instead granting him a year's asylum on August 1.

Rio de Janeiro-based Greenwald has interviewed Snowden and used 15,000 to 20,000 documents that Snowden passed to him to reveal details of the U.S. National Security Agency's surveillance methods.

Miranda was returning to Brazil from Berlin and was in transit at Heathrow, Greenwald said in a column posted on the Guardian website. He said British authorities seized his partner's laptop, cellphone and USB sticks.

"This was obviously designed to send a message of intimidation to those of us working journalistically on reporting on the NSA and its British counterpart, the GCHQ," Greenwald wrote, referring to Britain's Government Communications Headquarters.

Brazil's government complained about the detention of Miranda at Heathrow for nine hours incommunicado under the British anti-terrorism law.

"This measure has no justification since it involves an individual against whom there are no charges that can warrant the use of this legislation," the Brazilian foreign ministry said in a statement.

A statement from the Guardian said it was "dismayed" at Miranda's detention and that it would be pressing British authorities for an urgent clarification.



headline: Firefighters step up battle in Idaho blaze menacing resort towns
byline: By Laura Zuckerman
8:31am EDT

Firefighters readied for a massive ground and air attack on Sunday against a wildfire in central Idaho that has forced the evacuation of some 2,250 homes and threatens the posh Sun Valley ski resort.

The fire raging across parched sagebrush, grasslands and pine forests near high-end developments in Sun Valley has consumed 101,000 acres and destroyed one home and seven other buildings since a lightning strike sparked the blaze on August 7.

More than 1,000 firefighters were preparing on Sunday for what fire officials called "a heavy air show" in a drive to gain the upper hand over a blaze fed by low humidity, high temperatures and gusting winds.

Air tankers equipped with fire retardant and helicopters hauling water were to lead the fight on Sunday to protect the 5,128 residences, 1,399 commercial properties and 3,729 outbuildings threatened by the fire, said federal fire information officer Jim Chu.

For the first time since the so-called Beaver Creek fire ignited, weather conditions on Sunday favored firefighting efforts. A rise in humidity levels overnight paired with calmer winds made Sunday a crucial day in the push to knock down a fire that has advanced on affluent neighborhoods around the tourist town of Hailey and resort communities of Ketchum and Sun Valley.

The land and property in the area that is being threatened by the fire is worth some $8 billion, fire officials said Sunday.

The 11-day battle against the advancing flames has strained the tourism economy of the region at the height of the summer recreation season, and the improving weather conditions were cause for cautious celebration in Hailey, a city of 8,000.

"Saturday was really, really scary, but things seem to be looking up a bit today," said Carrie Morgridge, owner of Hailey Coffee Company.

Flames raced down a mountain on the west side of Hailey on Saturday, prompting a 3 a.m. evacuation of 200 homes. Morgridge opened the coffee shop during the pre-dawn hours to aid the displaced.

"In the good, in the bad, we will do what it takes to stay a community, to be an extended family, because that's really what we are," she said.

The resort towns nestled in a narrow mountain valley are known for hiking, biking, fishing and skiing, and for hosting the second homes of celebrities like former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and actor Tom Hanks.

The Beaver Creek fire is one of dozens of blazes raging in Western states amid a U.S. fire season that has brought substantial property losses and seen the deaths of dozens of firefighters.

Elsewhere in Idaho, the 1,000 summertime residents of the resort communities of Pine and Featherville were expected to be allowed back into their homes early Sunday evening after a days-long evacuation prompted by a 130,000-acre (53,000-hectare) wildfire that broke out on August 8.

The blaze east of Boise destroyed 38 homes and 43 other buildings and killed dozens of animals, including elk and deer. Wildlife officials euthanized a black bear that was badly burned when flames engulfed the tree it had climbed to escape the fire.



headline: Endangered eastern black rhino born at Atlanta zoo
byline: By Noreen O'Donnell
8:31am EDT

An eastern black rhinoceros has been born at Atlanta's zoo for the first time in the facility's history, spurring hopes of renewed interest in the fate of the critically endangered animal.

The calf, which was born on Saturday night, appears to be healthy and bonding with its mother, Zoo Atlanta officials said on Sunday. It has not been named and its gender has not been determined.

"Not only is this a first for Zoo Atlanta, going all the way back to our founding in 1889, but this is a critically endangered species that absolutely deserves the spotlight right now," Raymond King, the zoo's president, said in a statement. "We hope that as we watch the calf grow up, we can spark new connections with wildlife that desperately need our support."

The calf, which does not yet sport its species' signature horn, was born to Andazi, a 7-year-old female, and her 9-year-old mate, Utenzi.

It was the first offspring for both after the pair were recommended for breeding by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Rhino Species Survival Plan, which seeks to maintain a genetically diverse, self-sustaining rhino population in North American zoos.

Andazi's pregnancy was confirmed in December and viewed through an ultrasound earlier this year.

Rhinos have gestation periods ranging from 14 to 18 months. Calves are usually weaned within two years of being born, though they might remain with their mothers for up to four years.

The eastern black rhino was hunted almost to extinction, and in recent decades it has suffered near-catastrophic population declines, largely due to poaching. Its horns, skin and other body parts are believed by some to have medicinal value.

Conservation programs and patrolling of the rhino's habitats have helped populations to increase to about 4,800 in the wild. The western black rhino was declared extinct in 2011.

Black rhinos were once the most numerous of the species, according to the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, where a calf was born a year ago. Black rhinos numbered 65,000 in 1970, but the global population had dropped to 15,000 by 1980.



headline: First settlement reached in Penn State sex abuse civil case
byline: By Ian Simpson

old man who was sexually abused by former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky in a campus shower, the man's attorney said late on Saturday.

It is the first of 26 claims to be finalized in the Sandusky scandal, Philadelphia attorney Tom Kline told Reuters. He declined to give details of the settlement but the university has approved spending $60 million for the payouts.

The man, known as Victim 5 in court proceedings, was assaulted by Sandusky in August 2001, six months after then-graduate assistant Michael McQueary reported to university officials that he saw Sandusky rape a boy in a campus shower.

"My client is relieved," Kline said in a telephone interview. "He was dragged into this as someone who had a knock on the door from the state police. He didn't seek this out."

The settlement was reached on Friday, he said. It was first reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper on Saturday.

Sandusky was convicted last year on 45 counts of abusing 10 boys in a 15-year period. Sandusky, 69, was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison in a case that tarnished the reputation of late Penn State coach Joe Paterno and focused national attention on child sexual abuse.

Because the assault occurred so soon after the McQueary report and took place on campus, Victim 5's case was considered pivotal in reaching a settlement with other victims, Kline said.

The man testified both in the trial and in Sandusky's sentencing hearing.

Kline said he had reached the deal for a year with Michael Rozen, a lawyer hired by the university to help settle the cases. The newspaper had interviewed Rozen and Kline about the settlement.

Rozen told the Inquirer that lawyers in the other 25 suits had received the paperwork for settlements and their signoff was expected to be imminent. He the settlement with Victim 5 was one of the highest negotiated because of its circumstances.

Rozen told the newspaper that under the terms of the settlements, the victims have agreed not to pursue other suits against Penn State or the Second Mile, Sandusky's charity through which he met many of the victims.

They also have agreed to cede their right to sue Second Mile to the university, which plans to go to court to try to get the charity's insurer to reimburse the university for some of the claims.

Kline said the accord would be good for both victims and Penn State. The victims would get closure and the university would "have an open road to recovery of a good portion of this from insurers," he said.

Former university President Graham Spanier and two other university officials face trial on charges of failing to report and act on the abuse in the 2001 case reported by McQueary.

area transit system earlier this month have voted to reject a tentative contract deal and to send labor negotiators back to the bargaining table, their union said on Sunday.

The tentative accord had been reached on August 6, averting a walkout planned for the next day by 1,800 drivers and other workers against the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit Agency, which serves Oakland and Berkeley and links those areas with downtown San Francisco.

But rank-and-file members of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 192 voted overwhelmingly on Saturday, 576-257, against ratification of the settlement, the union said in a statement.

"Our members spoke out, loud and clear," said Yvonne Williams, union local president and business agent.

Union spokeswoman Sharon Cornu declined to comment beyond the union's written release, which said that its negotiators would "meet soon to review next steps."

Rejection of the contract proposal raises the possibility of further labor strife, but the statement made no explicit mention of whether the union intended to renew its strike threat.

Management declined to comment on the vote.

AC Transit is California's third-largest public bus system, serving 181,000 riders daily in two large counties - Alameda and Contra Costa, on the eastern side of San Francisco Bay.

The deal rebuffed by the rank-and-file called for a 9.5 percent wage hike over three years and annual flat-rate healthcare contributions by workers starting at $70, both sides have said.

Union workers initially demanded wage hikes totaling about 10 percent over three years, while the transit board sought to hold wage increases to 9 percent, company officials said.

The setback in labor talks comes after California Governor Jerry Brown intervened to block the resumption of a separate strike against commuter rail service threatened by unions representing workers at the Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, system.

Union members began negotiations with the AC Transit board in March, four months before the contract expired.

storage safe that he recently purchased on the Internet, authorities revealed on Sunday.

The 1,000-pound steel safe, ordered from Champion Safe Co. of Provo, Utah, was made in Nogales, Mexico, and shipped by truck from Mexico to Champion's warehouse near Mansfield, Ohio, Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart said.

The safe was delivered on June 19 to the customer in western Ohio by an independent driver working for Champion, Lenhart said.

The marijuana, tightly wrapped in 10, 28-pound packages, has an estimated street value of $420,000, according to Lenhart. He said the truck's shipment contained 25 to 30 safes, and that all the others were free of drugs.

Lenhart said his office has been working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration on the case and had decided not to reveal it publicly to avoid impeding the investigation. Authorities are not releasing the name of the customer for personal safety reasons.

The driver who delivered the safe to the customer has been cleared of any wrongdoing, but the driver who delivered the shipment from Mexico to Ohio is missing, according to Lenhart.

He said the DEA normally would not be interested in what is considered by federal agents to be a relatively small amount of marijuana. But the DEA is interested in learning more about the delivery method and size of such an operation.

"It's a pretty decent way of smuggling," Lenhart said. "My guess is that it's not the first time it's happened."

A gunman shot two women in a residential neighborhood of Denver on Friday, killing one, and set off a homemade bomb before he was critically wounded by police officers, authorities said.

Police Chief Robert White told reporters that police received an emergency 911 call saying that shots had been fired.

When police arrived at the scene, the gunman, later identified as 31-year-old Daniel Abeyta, opened fire on them and at a "makeshift incendiary device", which ignited, White said.

Officers then shot Abeyta in the shoulder and chest.

One woman was found dead inside a house and a second, at a different location, had been shot in the leg. She was in a serious condition at a Denver hospital, police said. They did not immediately know the relationship between the gunman and the women, whom they did not identify.

Police said in a statement that the homemade bomb was made of propane tanks with "gunpowder and possible grenades".

Residents were evacuated for several hours as officers searched the area for other explosives.

Abeyta will be investigated for first-degree murder and "other charges" if he recovers from his wounds, police said.



headline: Seattle investor who sought Sacramento Kings gave to anti-arena effort
byline: By Sharon Bernstein
8:31am EDT

Weeks after hedge fund manager Chris Hansen lost a bid to move the Sacramento Kings NBA basketball team to Seattle, he made an undisclosed donation to a group trying to defeat plans to build a new arena for the team in California, officials said on Friday.

Hansen had been trying for months to buy the team from its former owners and move it to Seattle to replace that city's own lost team, the SuperSonics. In January, he made a deal to buy the Kings from the family of George Maloof, longtime owners who had ongoing differences with the city over an arena.

But Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson quickly put together a group of California investors who made their own offer for the team, backing it up with intensive lobbying of the NBA to keep the Kings in Sacramento.

In May, the league sided with Johnson, saying the team should stay in the California capital, and the Maloofs then sold to the group Johnson had put together, headed by Silicon Valley executive Vivek Ranadive.

About four weeks later, Hansen, through the law firm Loeb &amp; Loeb, made a wire transfer of $80,000 to a political consulting firm, which failed to disclose that he was the donor, the chairwoman of the California Fair Political Practices Commission said on Friday.

The commission, an independent, bipartisan body set up by California voters to police campaign contributions and ethics, said the money was used to gather signatures for a ballot initiative aimed at defeating the planned new arena for the Kings.

The commission sued Loeb &amp; Loeb to find out who the donor was, and Hansen came forward to say he was the source of the money, Ann Ravel, the commission chairwoman, told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Because Hansen came forward, the lawsuit will be withdrawn, Ravel said. He also agreed to pay a penalty, which Ravel said would be modest. A spokesman for the commission said the final amount of the penalty was still being calculated.

In a statement released by email, Hansen called the donation "a mistake I regret."

After competition to his bid arose from the group the mayor put together, Hansen said, he engaged Loeb &amp; Loeb "to canvas the various opposition groups to gain an understanding of their efforts and the prospects of their success."

The law firm approached him with a request for a donation from one of the groups, and he agreed, Hansen wrote. It was not clear whether the money was used to benefit a particular opposition group because the lawsuit says it was spent directly by the political consulting firm.

"While I'm sure everyone can appreciate how easy it is to get caught up (in) the heat of battle, with the benefit of hindsight, this is clearly a decision I regret," Hansen wrote. "I wish the city of Sacramento and Kings fans the best in their efforts and they have my commitment not to have any involvement in their arena efforts in the future."



headline: CIA acknowledges its mysterious Area 51 test site for first time

8:31am EDT

the U.S. government has finally confirmed the existence of Area 51 in Nevada, but it makes no mention of little green men or alien spaceships.

The government acknowledged the existence of the mysterious aviation test site known as Area 51, a remote installation about 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas, in a newly declassified CIA history of its U-2 spy plane program.

After decades of extreme secrecy surrounding the site, stoking conspiracy theories about UFOs and experiments on alien spacecraft, the CIA lifted its veil on Area 51 in response to a public records request from George Washington University scholars in Washington, D.C.

Publicly released online on Thursday by the university's National Security Archive, the 400-page CIA history contains the first deliberate official references to Area 51, also known as Groom Lake, as a site developed by the intelligence agency in the 1950s to test fly the high-altitude U-2 reconnaissance plane.

Other top-secret aircraft were tested there later, including the supersonic reconnaissance A-12 aircraft, code-named OXCART, and the F-117 stealth ground-attack jet, said archive senior fellow Jeffrey Richelson, who asked for the CIA's U-2 history in 2005.

A newly revised document restoring numerous references to Area 51 that had been redacted in earlier versions was furnished by the CIA a few weeks ago, he said.

level decision to acknowledge the term 'Area 51' and its specific location," he told Reuters on Friday.

Chapter 2 of the CIA history recounts how Richard Bissell, the CIA officer then overseeing development of the U-2 plane by Lockheed, first spotted the site on an aerial scouting mission over Nevada in April 1955, accompanied by an Air Force officer and two others.

The four men landed their plane near an old, abandoned air strip at the edge of a salt flat known as Groom Lake near the northeastern corner of the Nevada Test Site, the nuclear proving ground then controlled by the Atomic Energy Commission.

IDEAL TEST SITE

The group agreed that Groom Lake would "make an ideal site for testing the U-2 and training its pilots." Bissell subsequently asked the Atomic Energy Commission to add the area to its Nevada real estate holdings, the account says.

"AEC Chairman Admiral Lewis Strauss readily agreed, and President Eisenhower also approved the addition of this strip of wasteland, known by its map designation as Area 51, to the Nevada Test Site," the document says.

To make the barren new facility seem more appealing to its workers, managers of the U-2 program dubbed the facility "Paradise Ranch," which was later shortened to "the Ranch."

Photos of the site and a newly declassified map outlining and labeling the location were also included in the document.

Richelson said he could recall at least two previous government documents in which an incidental reference to Area 51 appeared, but he assumed those were inadvertent because they were devoid of any other details or context.

The multiple detailed references to Area 51 in the latest CIA account - the document's index lists at least 12 mentions - show that they were deliberate, he said.

The intelligence agency had little to say about the disclosure.

"What readers of the CIA study will find is that CIA tests its U-2 and A-12 reconnaissance aircraft at the site in Nevada sometimes referred to as 'Area 51,'" CIA spokesman Edward Price said. "What readers won't find are any references to aliens or other conspiracy theories best left to the realm of science fiction."

Among the more sensational pieces of UFO conspiracy lore linked to Area 51 is that the remains of a flying saucer that supposedly crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, were brought to the site for reverse engineering experiments that attempted to replicate the extraterrestrial spacecraft.

Richelson said the CIA document makes no mention of any such theories. But he pointed to one passage that discusses the relationship between U-2s and unidentified flying objects "in the sense that people sighted U-2s in a time that they were very secretive and at very high altitude and didn't know what they were, and in that sense they were UFOs."



headline: Under fire, U.S. spy agency defends surveillance programs as lawful
byline: By Tabassum Zakaria and Mark Hosenball
8:31am EDT

Under increasing pressure to justify electronic surveillance programs that at times capture communications of American citizens, the U.S. National Security Agency went to unusual lengths on Friday to insist its activities are lawful and any mistakes largely unintentional.

In a sign of how much heat it has taken since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden started disclosing details of highly classified U.S. surveillance programs, the ultra-secretive intelligence agency held a rare conference call with reporters to counter public perceptions that NSA transgressions were willful violations of rules against eavesdropping on Americans.

The NSA's presentation was an attempt to calm the latest firestorm over documents disclosed by Snowden. The Washington Post late Thursday reported that the NSA had broken privacy rules or overstepped its legal authority thousands of times each year since 2008, citing an internal agency audit and other top secret documents.

"These are not willful violations, they are not malicious, these are not people trying to break the law," John DeLong, NSA director of compliance, told reporters.

NSA employees know their actions are recorded and the agency's culture is to report any mistakes, he said, repeatedly stressing that "no one at NSA thinks a mistake is OK."

Snowden, who was granted temporary asylum in Russia this month, gave information about secret NSA programs that collect phone, email and other communications to several media organizations, which published stories about them starting in June. His disclosures provoked an intense debate over privacy rights versus national security needs in the United States and several other countries, including Great Britain, Germany and Brazil.

The uproar led to a series of rare public comments by normally publicity-shy NSA officials, who have written opinion pieces in the media and repeatedly said transparency was a positive development.

"We're working on the release of more documents soon," DeLong said, without elaborating.

WILLFUL VIOLATIONS 'EXTREMELY RARE'

As DeLong explained that the NSA had rigorous internal measures to avoid, suppress and destroy intelligence inadvertently collected on Americans, leaders of both congressional intelligence committees issued statements strongly supporting NSA programs and the agency's efforts to comply with the law and regulations.

"The committee has never identified an instance in which the NSA has intentionally abused its authority to conduct surveillance for inappropriate purposes," Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, said.

Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, described errors reported in the Post story as "human and technical," which he said were "unfortunately inevitable in any organization and especially in a highly technical and complicated system like NSA."

But Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called the reports of privacy violations by the NSA "incredibly troubling" and said he had ordered his staff to conduct a review.

He said, however, "the information we have received so far does not show any intentional abuse or misuse of NSA's authorities."

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, said he planned to hold a hearing to examine reports of unauthorized surveillance by the NSA. "I remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the NSA," he said.

DeLong, who acknowledged that public debate was taking place in a "highly charged" atmosphere, said willful violations were "extremely rare" and that mistakes can lead to the removal of database access for an NSA employee.

DeLong said that NSA analysts make 20 million queries of intelligence databases on average each month, and that the number of mistakes are a tiny portion of legitimate queries.

He gave an example of how one mistake was handled. In a case where NSA allegedly stored 3,000 records, apparently related to Americans and legal immigrants, longer than the rules allowed, the information was not misused and subsequently deleted, he said.

"President Obama has long advocated greater transparency, stronger oversight and other reforms to give Americans confidence that our intelligence programs strike the right balance between protecting our national security and the privacy of our citizens," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

He said the White House would work with Congress on reforms "to further improve oversight and strengthen public confidence in these operations that are so critical to American national security."



headline: Mellow mood at first Seattle Hempfest since pot legalization
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

Pot smoke wafted over thousands of revelers gathered at Seattle's downtown waterfront to kick off the first Hempfest rally since Washington state and Colorado passed initiatives to legalize marijuana for recreational use last November.

The mellow mood among the revelers swaying to reggae music on Friday was in stark contrast to the harsh vibe at last year's event, which pitted pot activist against pot activist in a fight over the state ballot measure that some saw as a threat to medical marijuana producers and users.

"Last year, every five steps it was like, ‘Vote yes!' Vote no!' Vote yes!'" said Katelyn Cherry, 18, who ate shaved ice from a cone while sitting on a patch of grass next to a glass bong. "There's none of that going on anymore, so that's nice."

This year's Hempfest — expected to draw as many as 85,000 visitors in each of its three days — is meant to celebrate the new law and help heal the rifts of last year's campaign. It also aims to oppose marijuana's continued federal status as a dangerous narcotic with no legitimate medical applications, said Vivian McPeak, the event's longtime executive director.

"I would hope that people realize this is not the time to stop," he said. "When you're winning is the time to ramp it up and take it to the next level."

DORITO BAGS WITH POT LAWS

In the mid-1990s, McPeak recalled, police at Hempfest conducted undercover buy-and-bust operations, periodically slapping handcuffs on vendors of pot brownies and removing them from the premises.

But this year, instead of writing tickets for public pot smoking — which remains forbidden in the state — police were handing out about 1,000 bags of Doritos tortilla chips bearing information on the state's pot laws.

"It feels great that instead of issuing citations for public smoking, the police are issuing Dorito bags," McPeak said. "That seems like a big deal."

Many medical users and producers of marijuana feared that passage of the last year's ballot initiative, I-502, would lead to a crackdown on drivers who used pot and pressure lawmakers to create stricter rules and higher taxes for a medical industry that currently has little state oversight.

Among those opposing last year's legalization campaign was Don Skakie, who on Friday stood at a booth gathering signatures for a legislative initiative that would among other things exempt medical pot users from marijuana blood limits for driving that became effective under I-502.

Despite the bruised feelings from last year's initiative battle, Skakie said, most in the pot community have moved on.

"If people are still at each other it's over personal issues, not political issues," he said. "People have realized that we fought that fight."



headline: New Jersey governor vetoes proposed ban on .50 caliber rifles
byline: By David Jones
8:31am EDT

caliber rifles from the state, infuriating gun control activists who said that he was bowing to political pressure from the right.

The move comes a week after Christie signed into law 10 less controversial gun violence bills that were backed by gun control advocates, including bans on the sale of firearms to people on federal terrorism watch lists and increased penalties for firearms use.

But Christie said the prohibition on .50-caliber rifles would outlaw a weapon that had never been used in a crime in New Jersey.

"Tellingly, the legislature points to no instance of this class of firearms being used by even a single criminal in New Jersey," he said. "The wide scope of this total ban, therefore, will not further public safety, but only interfere with lawful recreational pastimes."

The bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Peter Barnes, called the veto puzzling, saying that Christie had previously expressed support for the concept.

"I can only assume Governor Christie caved to the extremists who oppose any common sense gun violence prevention effort," Barnes said.

Christie, seen as a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, also conditionally vetoed two other bills designed to curb gun violence, sending them back to the state legislature with language that the Democrat-controlled body was unlikely to accept.

The two measures would have created laws requiring law enforcement to report lost and stolen gun data to a federal database, embed information about gun permits onto a driver's license, create instant background checks and require safety training for gun owners.

Christie called the idea of using smart card technology to embed information into a driver's license "unworkable and impractical," saying it echoed a 2002 proposal for a personalized handgun that can only be fired by a recognized user.

"The technology didn't exist then and it doesn't now 11 years later," he said in a statement.

Gun rights advocates strongly supported the governor's veto, saying the measures would do little to reduce crime and were designed to forward a political agenda.

"After seven months of intense battles over misguided legislation that won't stop another crime or prevent another tragedy, we are grateful that Governor Christie has finally ended the discussion on the worst of the bills by tossing them onto the scrap heap where they belong," said Scott Bach, director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs.

Gun rights advocates nationwide were closely watching the legislation. Second Amendment supporters feared that if Christie signed the bills that he would give cover to other states to sign new gun restrictions into law.



headline: Ill-fated UPS jet was on autopilot seconds before crash
byline: By Verna Gates
8:31am EDT

The UPS cargo jet that crashed in Alabama this week, killing its two crew members, was flying on autopilot until seconds before impact, even after an alert that it was descending too quickly, authorities said on Saturday

"The autopilot was engaged until the last second of recorded data," said Robert Sumwalt, a senior official with the National Transportation Safety Board.

He said information retrieved by investigators from the flight data recorder aboard the United Parcel Service jet showed that its auto throttle also was engaged until moments before the fiery crash.

The Airbus A300 jet was approaching the runway at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth airport before dawn on Wednesday when it clipped the trees in an adjacent residential area and crashed into a steep embankment well short of the runway.

Sumwalt, who spoke at a media briefing near the crash site, had said on Friday that the pilots received a low altitude warning barely seven seconds before the sound of impact. He repeated that in his remarks on Saturday but did not say whether the alert had triggered any attempt by the crew members to disengage the autopilot as part of a last-ditch attempt to abort landing and re-gain altitude.

The pilots did not issue a distress call.

Sumwalt stopped short of saying there was anything unusual about a so-called "instrument approach" to the airport using autopilot.

But he said the NTSB would be looking closely into "UPS's instrument approach procedures" and how it typically went about guiding a large cargo hauler to touchdown on Birmingham-Shuttleworth's Runway 18.

That's the runway the UPS jet was approaching when it crashed and Sumwalt said the investigation would include a flight test at the airport in a UPS A300.

Shuttlesworth.

The airport can be tricky to land at because it is nestled among hills and that is especially true of Runway 18, said Hiatt.

Hiatt, a former Delta Airlines pilot, said he had touched down on the runway many times himself.

"It is not a full instrument landing. You have to visually fly into that runway," he said. "Sometimes it takes nuance to land there. You have to realize that hill is there or you could come in too low."

The crash occurred shortly before dawn in rainy conditions as low-lying clouds hung over Birmingham.

So far, Sumwalt said there was nothing to indicate the crash was caused by engine failure or any mechanical issues.

He also said the runway lights were examined and found to have been "within one one-100th of a degree of being properly aligned" at the time of the crash.

UPS has identified the dead crew members Cerea Beal Jr., 58, of Matthews, North Carolina, and Shanda Fanning, 37, of Lynchburg, Tennessee.

As a standard part of any accident investigation, Sumwalt said the NTSB was looking into the physical and mental well being of Beal and Fanning in the 72 hours before the accident.

Beal, the captain of the downed aircraft, had about 8,600 hours total flying experience, including more than 3,200 hours in the Airbus A300, according to the NTSB.



headline: Wildfire threatens Idaho ski resort towns as 200 homes evacuated
byline: By Laura Zuckerman
8:31am EDT

A wildfire raging across the central mountains of Idaho forced the evacuation of 200 homes in the tourist town of Hailey on Saturday as firefighters lost ground against a blaze threatening the nearby international ski destination of Sun Valley.

Blaine County Sheriff Gene Ramsey and his deputies went door to door at 3 a.m. local time urging people to leave their homes on the west side of Hailey.

Authorities lifted the evacuation order for Hailey neighborhoods before midday on Saturday but warned it could be imposed again.

More than 1,300 houses in outlying developments mostly north of Hailey remained under a mandatory evacuation, in the path of a wildfire that has burned over 92,000 acres of sagebrush flats, pine forests and granite canyons in the Sawtooth Range, mountains west of a highway that connects Hailey to the communities of Ketchum and Sun Valley to the north.

More than 1,000 people have fled upscale subdivisions on the southern outskirts of Ketchum, where some homes are worth tens of millions of dollars. The blaze has sent towering columns of smoke over the tourist towns nestled in a narrow mountain valley known for premier hiking, biking, fishing and skiing.

More than 1,600 firefighters were expected to be on hand on Saturday to guard homes, cut fire breaks and extinguish hot spots to keep flames from crossing to the east side of the highway that links the three towns and is the only developed road out of the valley.

The so-called Beaver Creek fire has claimed one primary residence, one bunkhouse and six other buildings since being sparked by lightning on August 7, federal fire information officer Sandy Miller said.

Roughly 30 people stayed overnight at an American Red Cross shelter in Hailey, where gawking crowds gathered on Saturday as air tankers equipped with fire retardant and helicopters with water buckets flew overhead.

"A lot of people are just watching the fire and our customers are talking about nothing else," said Alexis Sualez, barista at Zaney's River Street Coffee House in Hailey. "People are pretty worried."

The region known as the Wood River Valley once depended on mining, but now tourism fuels the economy that was jump-started in 1936 with the construction of the ski resort in Sun Valley. The valley is crisscrossed by all-season recreation trails and gated subdivisions of log mansions and luxury homes that border the Sawtooth National Forest.

It is one of several high-end enclaves in Western states that have been menaced in recent days by wildfires intensified by record heat, drought and fierce winds. Fire managers have said that mix has complicated their efforts to fight blazes this season in parched states like Idaho.

Crews grappling on Saturday with the Beaver Creek fire were warned that conditions could rapidly deteriorate amid rising temperatures and gusting winds.

"There is definitely a sense of anxiety," said Blaine County spokeswoman Bronwyn Nickel as residents and vacationers fled the area.



headline: Florida Keys considering drones to fight mosquitoes
byline: By Zachary Fagenson
8:31am EDT

The Florida Keys agency charged with keeping the island chain's mosquito swarms at bay might become the nation's first to use drones to spot remote breeding grounds as part of efforts to eradicate the insect.

"If you try to get across the small islands it's back country, it's jungle," said Michael Doyle, executive director of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, who added the drones wouldn't replace boots on the ground, but would help turn eradication efforts into "smart bombing."

On August 26 the head of North Carolina-based Condor Aerial will demonstrate the Maveric drone on a test flight for officials in hopes of selling the $65,000 aircraft to one of the Sunshine State's most popular tourist destinations.

The chain of islands begins about an hour south of Miami and stretches nearly 200 miles into the Gulf of Mexico. The southern tip of Key West is located only 90 miles from the shores of Cuba.

Condor Aerial CEO Fred Culbertson said the two-pound, two-and-a-half-foot-long drone can fly for 90 minutes at 200 feet. For mosquito control, they will be fitted with thermal cameras, which can show the pools where mosquitoes lay eggs as dark spots on the ground.

Inspectors will have to take pilot training certification courses and local officials will have to seek Federal Aviation Authority approval to fly the drones.

"They're not going to be used for surveillance," Culbertson stressed.

Condor Aerial is a division of Prioria Robotics, a north Florida-based manufacturer that in 2010 received a $2.8 million contract from Canada to supply reconnaissance drones in Afghanistan.

Mosquitoes breed in the stagnant water left after a high tide or a storm. The agency employs 40 inspectors who scour 42 islands spread across 140 square miles. After an event, inspectors have only days before eggs grow into biting, potentially disease-spreading adults.

When a drone spots a potential breeding ground an inspector would visit the site to test for eggs, before calling in one of the district's four helicopters to spray a bacteria to kill them.

"What we're looking to see is if this technology can actually see shallow water either out in the open or under mangroves," Doyle said. "And how much land can it cover quickly so the inspectors can get out that day."

Doyle said the drones could help him better monitor the Keys with less staff. "As our budget is getting smaller we're trying to find ways to cover the same area with fewer people," he said.

Keys officials regularly battle the common Salt Marsh mosquitoes that breed by the millions and can fly up to six miles. Yet their chief concern is the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries dengue, known as breakbone fever for the intense joint pains it causes.

In 2010 the disease infected 63 people, according to a Center for Disease Control report.

Dengue mosquitoes can lay eggs in small, hidden pools that drones might not be able to spot. The only effective solution, Doyle said, is to visit sites multiple times a month, emptying any containers and spraying chemicals to kill any larvae that might grow.

"They've found them growing in a two-liter bottle cap," he added.

As well as considering drones, officials are awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval to release genetically modified, sterile males into the wild to mate with wild females that would produce no offspring. Doyle hopes the plan could collapse the mosquito population.

Still, there's no way to eradicate the insect completely. Tourists and seasonal residents are always introducing new species and diseases into the environment.

"Every time somebody brings a potted plant from Home Depot in Miami there are eggs in there," Doyle said. "The next time it rains there will be a few more mosquitoes."



headline: Romanian princess among 18 charged in Oregon over cockfighting
byline: By Teresa Carson
8:31am EDT

A Romanian princess, the daughter of exiled former Romanian King Michael, appeared in a U.S. court on Friday with her American husband on charges related to cockfighting in rural Oregon, authorities said.

Irina Walker, 60, was among 18 people charged with holding 10 cockfighting "derbies" in 2012 and 2013, according to the indictment filed in federal district court in Oregon.

A woman reached by phone at the Romanian Embassy in Washington, D.C., who declined to be identified, said the mission had been informed that a daughter of King Michael had been arrested in Oregon.

"She was born in Switzerland," the woman said. "We don't really have a lot of information on her."

The exiled king, who was forced to abdicate in 1947 and then went into exile, said in a statement that he had learned of his daughter's arrest with "profound sadness."

"His Majesty and the entire royal family hope that the American justice system and the courts of the state of Oregon will solve this case in the fairest and quickest way possible," the statement said, according to an NBC news website.

Princess Irina is the third of five daughters of the Romanian king and is married to John Wesley Walker, a former Coos County sheriff's deputy, the Oregonian newspaper reported. She moved to Oregon in 1983 and married Walker in 2007, the paper reported.

Of the 18 people charged in the case, six including the Walkers are charged with operating an illegal gambling business. All 18 are charged with conspiracy and violating the Animal Welfare Act by conducting unlawful animal fighting ventures on the 10 occasions.

Calling cockfighting barbaric, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon, Amanda Marshall, said in a statement that "cockfighting jeopardizes public health and safety and facilitates the commission of other criminal acts."

Each of the 12 counts carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000. If convicted, the Walkers could also have to forfeit their ranch in Irrigon, Oregon, according to the Justice Department announcement.

old Michigan girl was in stable condition in hospital on Friday after a black bear chased her down and clawed her, leaving her with deep lacerations to her thigh, the state's department of natural resources said on Friday.

Abby Wetherell was on foot on a road near her home in Wexford County at about 9 p.m. on Thursday when the black bear attacked her, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources said.

"She began to run in hopes of reaching nearby homes," the department said in a statement. "Abby was able to get to her feet and ran again. The bear caught up with her and attacked a second time."

The department said a neighbor heard her screams and ran to her rescue, startling the bear, which ran off.

During the attack, the bear clawed her, causing deep lacerations to her thigh. Wetherell was airlifted to a hospital where she underwent surgery, according to the department.

Bear attacks often occur when a mother is protecting her cubs. According to the natural resources department, there is no evidence that cubs were present near the attack.

In an unrelated attack on Thursday, a grizzly bear wounded two hikers in Yellowstone National Park after they unexpectedly encountered the bear's new cub.

The same day, Idaho wildlife officials reported that two biologists collecting grizzly habitat data in the eastern part of the state were knocked down and injured by a charging grizzly after they startled it.



headline: UPS pilots warned of low altitude seven seconds before crash
byline: By Verna Gates
8:31am EDT

U.S. government investigators looking into the crash of a UPS cargo plane said on Friday the pilots received a low altitude warning barely seven seconds before the sound of impact, according to data recovered from the cockpit voice recorder.

Investigators retrieved data from the cockpit and flight data recorders on Friday that could shed light on Wednesday's fiery crash in Alabama that killed the jet's pilot and co-pilot.

"I personally breathed a huge sigh of relief once I learned we had good data," said Robert Sumwalt, a senior official with the National Transportation Safety Board. "We'll know everything that was said in the cockpit."

Sumwalt said a preliminary review of the voice and data recorders showed the pilots received the first of two audible warnings before the sound of impact can be heard, indicating the United Parcel Service Inc cargo plane was descending at a hazardous rate.

A warning system in the air-traffic computers at Birminghan's airport showed no indications the plane was approaching too low, Sumwalt said.

The cockpit voice and flight recorders arrived at the NTSB's headquarters in Washington late on Thursday, hours after they were pulled from a heap of melted plastic and debris at the crash site.

Preliminary results from the agency's investigation, which is still in its early stages, have shown no evidence of engine fire, and the pilots did not issue a distress call.

The Airbus A300 jet was approaching the runway at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth airport before dawn when it clipped the trees in an adjacent residential area and crashed well short of the runway.

An air traffic controller on duty told NTSB investigators he saw a "bright spark flash" that looked like a powerline breaking, Sumwalt said. The controller saw the plane's landing lights "followed by a bright, orange flash ... and then a red glow."

The NTSB has sent investigators to Louisville, Kentucky, to study the A300's maintenance records, officials said.

UPS identified the crew members who died as 58-year-old Cerea Beal Jr., of Matthews, North Carolina, and Shanda Fanning, 37, of Lynchburg, Tennessee.

Beal, the captain, who was at the controls on Wednesday, had been with UPS since 1990, and before that he served more than six years in the U.S. Marine Corps as a helicopter operator.

The NTSB said he had about 8,600 hours total flying experience, including more than 3,200 hours in the Airbus A-300.



headline: Searches turn up letters from California teen to abductor
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

old daughter of a longtime family friend and took her to the Idaho wilderness after killing her mother and brother had letters from the teen, search warrants showed on Friday.

The San Diego County Sheriff's office warrants also showed 13 phone calls or text messages between phones belonging to the San Diego area girl and her abductor, James DiMaggio, on the day she went missing.

The San Diego County Sheriff's Department, which requested eight search warrants in the case, declined to say whether Anderson or DiMaggio initiated the calls.

Agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation shot and killed DiMaggio and rescued Hannah Anderson on Saturday in the rugged Idaho mountains after a multi-state manhunt. They were located after a group of horseback riders told authorities they had encountered the pair.

Sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell stressed on Friday that after extensively interviewing Hannah Anderson and reviewing the evidence, investigators had concluded she was an innocent victim.

"Hannah was a victim in every sense of the word," Caldwell said Friday. "We cannot be more clear on that."

Hannah Anderson's mother, Christina Anderson, 44, and her dog were found dead in the garage of DiMaggio's home on August 4 in the rural community of Boulevard, California, about 45 miles east of San Diego.

Her 8-year-old brother, Ethan, was found in DiMaggio's log cabin after a fire that burned the house to the ground and left investigators so little to go on that they had to use DNA to identify the boy.

One of the warrants said the mother and son had been tortured and killed. The records showed that DiMaggio also had a makeshift bomb in his garage, and suggest he may have also rigged the house to burn.

"WELFARE CHECK"

The Anderson family was last seen alive by neighbors on Saturday, August 3, deputies said. Deputies had checked their apartment in the San Diego area community of Lakeside on Sunday after a neighbor called to express concern and found no one home, according to the warrants. The warrants did not say who requested the welfare check, or check on their well being.

The deputies' search of DiMaggio's home, conducted as authorities hunted for clues to help them locate the missing teen, recovered 53 items including a crow bar, an incendiary device, tape, empty ammunition boxes and a red dog leash, according to the court documents.

Authorities also found an empty handcuff box, a knife box, small caliber ammunition, an empty gas canister and a pair of women's sunglasses.

In the Anderson family apartment, investigators recovered six computers, both towers and laptops, five still and video cameras and two iPods.

Also in the apartment, detectives gathered items including Hannah Anderson's orthodontic retainer, greeting cards, El Capitan High School paperwork, a picture album and a photo of DiMaggio.

Detectives also searched telephone and Facebook accounts belonging to Lora DiMaggio Robinson, DiMaggio's sister.

Hannah Anderson's father, Brett Anderson, has said he was baffled by the actions of DiMaggio, whom he described as a trusted longtime friend considered an uncle by the children.

A law enforcement source said DiMaggio had served as the best man at Brett and Christina Anderson's wedding.

headline: Appellate court blocks Pennsylvania voter ID law for November 5 election
byline: By Dave Warner
8:31am EDT

An appellate court on Friday ruled that Pennsylvania will once again be prohibited from enforcing its controversial voter identification law at the polls in November.

Commonwealth Court Judge Bernard McGinley issued an injunction that prohibits use of the law at the general election on November 5 and also stops poll workers from telling voters they may have to produce identification in future elections, according to the court's website.

The November election will be the third election in which the law was blocked from being used since the measure was passed in March 2012, by a Republican-led legislature.

Supporters have said the law is aimed at ensuring that only those legally eligible to vote cast ballots. Critics have said it is designed to keep minority voters, who typically vote Democratic, away from the polls. Similar debates have stoked controversy in other states.

In his ruling, Judge McGinley said the information that poll workers conveyed to voters in earlier elections about required identification was not accurate.

"It is the intent of this preliminary injunction to enjoin verbally informing electors about the necessity of proofs of identification for future elections," McGinley wrote.

The ruling was cheered by advocates for voters who fought the measure in court.

"We are very pleased that hundreds of thousands of eligible voters will be able to cast ballots in upcoming elections regardless of whether or not they have required identification," said Jennifer Clarke of the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia.

Supporters of the law, including Republican state House majority leader Mike Turzai, were not immediately available for comment.

The state of Pennsylvania has acknowledged there has never been a case of in-person voter fraud, according to court testimony.

On Monday North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory signed into law a requirement that voters present photo identification at the polls.



headline: Families in 'Baby Veronica' adoption dispute agree to mediation
byline: By Heide Brandes
8:31am EDT

The biological and adoptive families battling for custody of a Native American girl named Veronica agreed to mediation on Friday after talking for more than three hours at an Oklahoma custody hearing, according to court records.

The judge in the case issued a gag order, barring further public comment by the families of "Baby Veronica," and sealed all the records in the case.

No further details were released. The hearing in a Cherokee County, Oklahoma, courthouse was closed to the public.

Cherokee Nation member Dusten Brown and his tribe are fighting the legality of adoption proceedings by a South Carolina couple who took custody of the girl shortly after her birth in 2009.

Brown, who won custody of the girl in late 2011, refused to turn over the girl after that decision was nullified in June by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Veronica, who will be 4 in September, has now lived roughly half her life with each family.

Both sides - Brown and his family, and adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco - were in court after the Capobiancos accused him in court filings late Thursday of abducting their adopted daughter and asked the judge to order her returned to them.

Brown is currently facing possible extradition to South Carolina, where the Capobiancos live, on a felony charge of custody interference.

Friday's hearing was the first time the families have met in person since the Capobiancos arrived in Oklahoma on Monday to push for a resolution and try to bring Veronica back to South Carolina with them.

The families met again later in the day in a custody hearing in a Cherokee tribal court but no details were released.

The case has highlighted overlapping parental claims in two states, and the clash between a Native American culture seeking to protect children from being adopted outside their tribes and U.S. legal safeguards for adoptive parents.

The situation has become so wrenching that the governors in Oklahoma and South Carolina have spoken on the phone about it and are pushing for a resolution outside the court.

Veronica's birth mother, who is not Native American, arranged the adoption with the Capobiancos before the girl was born. Veronica lived with them after her birth in 2009. Brown intervened in 2010 before the adoption process was final, and a South Carolina family court ordered that Veronica be turned over to Brown in December 2011.

Brown has argued that when he turned over parental rights to the girl's mother, he did not realize she would put the child up for adoption.

Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation who was not married to the birth mother, argued that the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 allowed him to have Veronica, who is 3/256th Cherokee.

The law was intended to keep Native American children from being separated from their families by the U.S. government.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the ruling and decided the act did not apply in Veronica's situation. The adoption by the Capobiancos was finalized in South Carolina in July.

But Brown refused to give up Veronica and was arrested on August 12 in Oklahoma on a charge of "custodial interference."

The Capobiancos have said they are willing to compromise with a resolution that allows Veronica to maintain a relationship with her Oklahoma family.



headline: New Jersey governor to sign law easing pot use for sick kids

8:31am EDT

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Friday acted on new legislation that will make it easier for children and teenagers suffering from serious illnesses to obtain medical marijuana.

Christie agreed to sign the so-called pot-for-tots bill if the New Jersey legislature makes changes, including removing wording that would have reduced the number of required physician recommendations for children.

He also agreed that children should be allowed access to edible forms of marijuana besides lozenges, considered difficult for young patients to use properly, but asked for tighter language in the bill to be sure only minors can get the medication.

Christie agreed with other parts of the bill, including eliminating the three-strain cultivation limit on authorized dispensaries, which would allow growers to develop products tailored for individual patients, including some adults, according to proponents.

Christie, who is running for reelection as New Jersey's governor and widely considered a contender for president in 2016, gave his "conditional" approval to the bill but sent it back to the legislature with the suggested changes.

"I am making commonsense recommendations to this legislation to ensure sick children receive the treatment their parents prefer, while maintaining appropriate safeguards," he said in a statement.

New Jersey is one of 19 states with a medical marijuana program, but the state's rules have made it difficult for young patients to enroll in treatment, according to proponents of the bill.

The legislation has been sitting on Christie's desk for nearly two months and his conditional approval comes two days after he was confronted at a campaign stop by a Scotch Plains father whose 2-year-old suffers from Dravet Syndrome, a potentially deadly form of epilepsy.

Brian Wilson urged Christie in a restaurant full of voters to sign the bill saying, "Don't let my daughter die."

Wilson said the kind of marijuana that helps stop his daughter's seizures currently is grown only in Colorado.

Christie acknowledged that marijuana is a controlled substance under U.S. federal law and "implementing a state controlled program while the drug remains illegal has raised numerous challenges." The administration of President Barack Obama has discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing people who distribute marijuana for medical purposes under state laws.

headline: UPS pilots warned of low altitude 7 seconds before crash
byline: By Verna Gates
8:31am EDT

U.S. government investigators looking into the crash of a UPS cargo plane said on Friday the pilots received a low altitude warning barely seven seconds before the sound of impact, according to data recovered from the cockpit voice recorder.

Investigators retrieved data from the cockpit and flight data recorders on Friday that could shed light on Wednesday's fiery crash in Alabama that killed the jet's pilot and co-pilot.

"I personally breathed a huge sigh of relief once I learned we had good data," said Robert Sumwalt, a senior official with the National Transportation Safety Board. "We'll know everything that was said in the cockpit."

Sumwalt said a preliminary review of the voice and data recorders showed the pilots received the first of two audible warnings before the sound of impact can be heard, indicating the United Parcel Service Inc cargo plane was descending at a hazardous rate.

A warning system in the air-traffic computers at Birminghan's airport showed no indications the plane was approaching too low, Sumwalt said.

The cockpit voice and flight recorders arrived at the NTSB's headquarters in Washington late on Thursday, hours after they were pulled from a heap of melted plastic and debris at the crash site.

Preliminary results from the agency's investigation, which is still in its early stages, have shown no evidence of engine fire, and the pilots did not issue a distress call.

The Airbus A300 jet was approaching the runway at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth airport before dawn when it clipped the trees in an adjacent residential area and crashed well short of the runway.

An air traffic controller on duty told NTSB investigators he saw a "bright spark flash" that looked like a powerline breaking, Sumwalt said. The controller saw the plane's landing lights "followed by a bright, orange flash ... and then a red glow."

The NTSB has sent investigators to Louisville, Kentucky, to study the A300's maintenance records, officials said.

UPS identified the crew members who died as 58-year-old Cerea Beal Jr., of Matthews, North Carolina, and Shanda Fanning, 37, of Lynchburg, Tennessee.

Beal, the captain, who was at the controls on Wednesday, had been with UPS since 1990, and before that he served more than six years in the U.S. Marine Corps as a helicopter operator.

The NTSB said he had about 8,600 hours total flying experience, including more than 3,200 hours in the Airbus A-300.

inspired attack.

Major Nidal Hasan, an American-born Muslim and U.S. Army psychiatrist, has admitted during his ongoing court-martial proceedings to opening fire at a medical complex at the sprawling military base in Central Texas in 2009, saying he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war against Islam.

Hasan believed the United States was "going to war to eradicate sharia law" and he was unable to balance being a Muslim with being in the U.S. military, the sanity board report said, so he needed to "help my Muslim brothers overseas."

He saw his options as spreading the word of God, joining the Taliban and "doing something violent," according to a confidential report Hasan provided to Reuters through his former civilian defense attorney, John Galligan.

"The accused reported that getting deployment orders was a 'task from God to speed up his actions.' He acknowledged that his 'oath to God' was overriding his 'oath to America,'" the report said.

"Fighting for God was a noble deed," Hasan told the panel.

Galligan, who had previously released portions of the report to other media, offered two additional pages to Reuters after consulting with Hasan and in response to queries about what provoked Hasan to fire on his fellow soldiers, Galligan said.

Hasan, acting as his own defense attorney, has offered the report to prosecutors, but the judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, blocked it from being handed over and ordered prosecutors to ignore media reports about its contents.

Hasan received deployment orders dated October 29, 2009, saying he was to report to Fort Benning, Georgia, by November 28, 2009, for training after which he would be sent to Afghanistan. He said he expected to be sent to Afghanistan at least one year after his July 2009 transfer to Fort Hood.

"I was shocked ... I wasn't expecting (to deploy) this soon," Hasan told the panel, known as sanity board.

More than 70 people have testified so far in the court-martial, which began last week, including several witnesses who quoted Hasan, 42, as screaming "Allahu akbar" ("God is greatest" in Arabic) as he sprayed gunfire with his laser-sighted handgun on unarmed fellow soldiers on November 5, 2009.

Forensic expert witnesses this week chronicled a crime scene littered with shell casings and discarded cartridge magazines and victims' suffering, including Private Francheska Velez, who screamed "my baby! my baby!" in a futile plea to save her unborn child. She died after a bullet pierced her back and heart before resting in her right lung.

Kimberly Munley, a former sergeant with Fort Hood police who had a "violent" and chaotic gun battle with Hasan, testified on Friday both their weapons appeared to jam during the encounter before another officer shot Hasan.

Munley was shot three times and Hasan, who stumbled off, was left paralyzed from the waist down.

Hasan could receive the death penalty if the jury of 13 officers unanimously finds him guilty of premeditated murder. The U.S. military has not executed a service member since 1961.

Hasan, who attends court in a wheelchair, is acting as his own lawyer, though he has rarely cross-examined witnesses or mounted objections. On Friday, he rested his head in his right hand and rubbed his temple, appearing pale and wan in his camouflage military uniform with an American flag patch affixed to his shoulder.

headline: Accused California serial killer makes own closing argument at trial
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

An accused California serial killer delivered the closing argument at his own capital murder trial on Friday, insisting as he has from the start of the proceeding that the prosecution's case is built on nothing more than "opinions and theories."

Joseph Naso, 79, charged with first-degree murder in the slayings of four prostitutes dating back to the 1970s, has acted as his own attorney during the nearly two-month trial in a Marin County, north of San Francisco, but declined to take the witness stand in his own defense.

The balding, retired photographer has admitted a penchant for taking pictures of women in nylons and high heels, some of which he has exhibited in court, but maintains he never killed anyone.

After weeks in which prosecutors presented the testimony of roughly 70 witnesses, Naso called only handful of individuals to the stand, including a woman who once posed for him as a model and an artist that the defendant asked to vouch for his work.

Prosecutors presented their closing arguments on Wednesday, summarizing their evidence for how they said Naso isolated his victims, sexually assaulted and strangled them, disposed of their bodies in remote areas and then documented his crimes in a journal.

After a one-day recess in the proceedings, it was Naso's turn to summarize his case for the jury, which he did as he stood under guard behind a podium, dressed in a gray sports jacket, a white shirt and a red-and-gray striped tie.

"The prosecution has focused their entire evidence not on weak circumstantial evidence, but on weak opinions and theories," he said. "The prosecution has constructed this entire case against me. It all equals one thing - guesswork."

Naso said prosecutors had no proof he murdered any the four northern California women. But he did concede that DNA found in the pantyhose worn by one of the women, Roxene Roggasch, when she was found dead might justify the conclusion he had sex with her.

Roggasch, 18, and Carmen Colon, 22, were slain in the 1970s. Two other victims, Pamela Parsons, 38, and Tracy Tafoya, 31, were killed in the 1990s.

"Why is my DNA on the pantyhose?" Naso asked, reading from a yellow sheet of notes. "Even if it was on there, all it proves is I may have had sex with her, but I didn't kill her. The prosecution can't prove that."

Naso could face the death penalty if he is convicted of any more than one of the "alphabet murders," so named because the first and last name of each victim begins with the same letter.

Investigators began to tie Naso to the murders in 2010 after law enforcement officers visiting his Nevada home while he was on probation for an unrelated felony theft conviction found ammunition there.

A further search of his Reno house turned up what prosecutors have described as diaries of sexual assaults, a list of 10 victim dumping grounds and hundreds of photographs of scantily clad women, many appearing dead or unconscious.

Judge Andrew Sweet regularly admonished Naso throughout his closing argument, as he has throughout the trial, for violating court rules.



headline: New York City mayor says fingerprints should be used to access public housing

run housing projects as a way of increasing security.

"What we really should have is fingerprinting to get in," Bloomberg said while speaking on WOR-AM radio about ways to improve safety in public housing. "We've just gotta find some ways to keep bringing crime down there."

Bloomberg, whose third term in office expires at the end of this year, pointed out that locks on buildings were often broken.

The mayor said the projects, run by the largest public housing authority in North America, account for 20 percent of New York City's crime even though they house about 5 percent of its residents. Some 620,000 low- and moderate-income tenants live in the city's public housing.

Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman for the mayor's office, said Bloomberg was talking about using fingerprint technology to replace traditional locks.

Bill Thompson, the former city comptroller and sole African American candidate in the mayor race, called Bloomberg's fingerprint remarks "disrespectful" and "disgraceful."

"Just like stop-and-frisk, this is another direct act of treating minorities like criminals," Thompson said.

Public advocate Bill de Blasio, the current Democratic front runner whose wife is African American, said the mayor should apologize for his remarks.

"Once again, Mayor Bloomberg has resorted to presuming innocent people are guilty simply because they happen to live in certain areas, and in doing so he is stigmatizing entire communities," he said.

The mayor made his comments on the same day the city appealed a federal judge's ruling that the New York City Police Department's stop-and-frisk crime fighting policy was unconstitutional and disproportionately targeted racial minorities.

During his radio interview, Bloomberg said he was concerned the court ruling might make it more difficult for police to patrol public housing units.

Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) called the mayor's comments an outrage.

"Families live in public housing apartments, not criminals," she said in a statement.

"Public housing residents, as well as their friends and family members visiting them, deserve the same level of respect from our mayor as any other New York City resident," she said.

A gunman shot two women in a residential neighborhood in Denver on Friday, killing one, and set off a homemade bomb before he was critically wounded by police, authorities said.

Police were searching the area for more explosives.

Police Chief Robert White told reporters that police received an emergency 911 call of shots fired. After police arrived, the gunman opened fire on them and at a "makeshift incendiary device," which ignited, White said.

Police then shot and critically wounded the gunman, he said.

One woman was found dead inside a home and a second at a different location suffered a gunshot wound to the leg. Police said they did not immediately know the relationship between the gunman and the women.

"His intent was to hurt someone," White said.

Denver police said they were looking for more explosives in the area. A police Twitter message read: "Chief confirms incendiary devices are propane tanks with gunpowder, possible grenades."



headline: Military judge finds Manning's WikiLeaks acts 'wanton and reckless'
byline: By Tom Ramstack
8:31am EDT

The military judge who will determine how long U.S. soldier Bradley Manning will spend in prison for the biggest breach of classified data in the nation's history on Friday said she found that his acts were "wanton and reckless."

Judge Colonel Denise Lind last month found Manning, 25, guilty of 20 criminal counts, including espionage and theft, for handing over some 700,000 secret U.S. documents to the WikiLeaks pro-transparency website.

On Monday, she will begin deliberations on Manning's sentence. He could face up to 90 years in prison for his role in a case that catapulted WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, into the world spotlight.

"Manning's conduct was of a heedless nature that made it actually and imminently dangerous to others. His conduct was both wanton and reckless," Lind said in a series of written findings issued after prosecutors finished their sentencing arguments on Friday.

Manning was working as a low-level intelligence analyst at a military base in Baghdad in 2010 when he handed over battlefield videos, diplomatic cables and other documents to WikiLeaks. He hoped the move would spark a broad debate about U.S. foreign activities, his lawyers said.

Military prosecutors argued that the breach aided al Qaeda militants and harmed the United States.

Manning's lawyers this week presented their case for giving the defendant a mild sentence. Witnesses including military mental health specialists and members of Manning's family testified that the soldier, who is gay, showed signs that he was unsuitable for overseas deployment, including violent outbursts.

The slightly built soldier, dressed in his uniform and glasses, his hair cropped close, on Wednesday addressed the court for the first time since February, saying that he was "sorry" and understood that he "must pay a price" for his actions.

Before the prosecutors rested their case Friday, they presented a written statement from Army Criminal Investigation Command Special Agent David Shaver, who said chat logs and e-mail he found on Manning's computer in Iraq indicated he was responsible for leaking the classified documents.

Manning and his attorney said they would not dispute Shaver's statement.

Lind is expected to sentence Manning sometime next week.

On Monday, the prosecution and defense attorneys are scheduled to make their final arguments on what they believe is the most appropriate sentence for the 25-year-old Manning.

The material Manning released that shocked many around the world was a 2007 gunsight video of a U.S. Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Baghdad. A dozen people were killed, including two Reuters news staff. WikiLeaks dubbed the footage "Collateral Murder."

knit Muslim community remember Nidal Hasan as a quiet loner who stood shoeless on the carpet of their mosque almost four years ago and sang the first words of the morning call to prayer: "Allahu akbar."

They still have trouble understanding how, just a few hours later, the Army psychiatrist could have shouted those same words - "God is greatest" in Arabic - and then fatally shot 13 soldiers and wounded 31 others, witnesses said.

As Hasan's court martial resulting from the November 5, 2009, attack unfolded this month at the vast Fort Hood military base, Muslims in Killeen, a Texas city of roughly 134,000, were struggling to cope with the fact they prayed, mingled and dined with Hasan in the days and minutes before the attack.

It has been difficult to reconcile the prayerful man they knew with the one who declared "I am the shooter" at the beginning of his trial.

"I wish I could forget about this guy, the trauma that this brought to us," said Osman Danquah, 65, who prayed alongside the shooter at a mosque and dined with him twice.

One evening in between prayers at the mosque within the Islamic Community of Greater Killeen, Danquah recalled how Hasan twice sought his advice on how he should treat seemingly anonymous Muslim soldiers who wanted out of the military and opposed U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Danquah, himself a Gulf War veteran, told him all of the people in the military volunteered to serve, although they could raise issues as conscientious objectors.

Hasan would later tell military health evaluators his spree amounted to "jihad" against fellow foreign-bound U.S. soldiers "going against the Islamic Empire," and that dying during the attack would signal God had designated him as a religious martyr.

"In Islam, you cannot take revenge against people if you have no evidence," Danquah said. "What crime did they commit?"

JAIL OR DYING

During prayers, congregants, some in traditional Muslim dress, knelt on the plush green carpeting as ceiling fans whirled against the Texas heat. Bookshelves flanking a rug-draped chair were crammed with multiple copies of the Islamic holy book, the Koran, in several languages. Shoes and sandals lined shelves near the entrance.

Kids on bikes swirled around the red brick building's parking lot, on a wide highway dotted with ranch houses, auto shops, chain restaurants and the gun store where Hasan armed himself.

After Hasan left the mosque before the shooting, he stopped at a convenience store for coffee and hash browns, he told the mental health panel. He later went home, collected two guns and 20 to 30 magazines, and returned for noon prayers.

He knew the prayers would be his last before "either going to jail or dying," Hasan, now 42, told the military health panel.

Military police eventually shot Hasan, who was left paralyzed from the waist down and attends court in a wheelchair. He maintains his prayer schedule during breaks.

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges against Hasan, who could face the death penalty if all 13 officers on the jury find him guilty of premeditated murder.

Amina Rab, the president of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas area, said the broader community was shocked by what she called Hasan's horrific act.

"He can try to justify his actions any way he likes to," Rab said. "It's not Islam that goes out and kills people no matter what they do to you."

The shooting rampage came at a time of heightened tensions over the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which strained relations between the United States and countries with predominantly Muslim populations.

Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing to whom U.S. intelligence officials said Hasan sent emails, praised Hasan as a hero and "a man of conscience." Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011.

But for many who met him at the mosque, Hasan remains a mystery.

"Only God knows the heart of a human," said Mustafa Salaam, a 46-year-old retired sergeant first class and current mosque president. "We can see people in attendance five prayers a day but that doesn't mean you can tell what's in someone's heart."

day occupation of the state Capitol's ground floor on Thursday.

They vowed to take their demands to college campuses and state lawmakers' campaign rallies in a long-term push for social change.

"I say to the young people here, you're ending a protest because you started a movement," Julian Bond, former chairman of the NAACP, said at a news conference in the Capitol rotunda.

"That movement is going to reverberate across the state of Florida and eventually to the adjoining states, until all of America knows something about the strength and the power that was demonstrated here."

Calling themselves the Dream Defenders, the group began its sit-in four days after the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the fatal shooting of teen-ager Trayvon Martin in the central Florida town of Sanford.

Florida Governor Rick Scott rejected their demands for a special session, and efforts to get the Republican-run Legislature to convene one also fell short.

The gathering of mostly black, college-aged demonstrators had vowed to camp in the Capitol until Scott and the legislative leadership addressed their demands.

But less than a day after a legislative headcount showed at least 83 members opposed to a session and only 27 favoring one, Dream Defenders executive director Phillip Agnew announced his group was calling off the sit-in.

"Our work and our power have grown too big for these halls," Agnew said. "It's time for the movement to continue ... this is the last time that I'm going to sleep on these floors."

With the school year starting soon, Agnew said Dream Defenders will work on campuses to register 61,550 voters - the margin of Scott's victory in the 2010 election - and plans to send a delegation later this month to the 50th anniversary commemoration of the famous March on Washington.

He said his organization has been given a speaking slot at the rally.

"This is only the beginning of Takeover Florida. We will leave from here to every college and university around the state," said Agnew. "This is not the last you will hear the question, 'Can we dream together?' ... After 31 days and 30 nights, we are indeed leaving the Capitol for our next phase."

Agnew said the Dream Defenders accomplished some of their goals - staging the longest Capitol sit-in ever and getting House Speaker Will Weatherford to call for a committee hearing next month on the 2005 "Stand Your Ground" law.

That statute permits use of lethal force in self-defense when law-abiding citizens fear their lives are in danger.

Zimmerman was acquitted in July with a traditional self-defense argument, but jury instructions included the language of the "Stand Your Ground" law.

headline: California grapples with inmate illness as hunger strike drags on
byline: By Sharon Bernstein
8:31am EDT

striking prisoners who have refused to eat for nearly six weeks to protest the state's solitary confinement policies.

As the hunger strike enters its 40th day on Friday, dozens of inmates have been sent to hospitals or prison infirmaries, and officials are bracing for more illness among the 118 prisoners who have not eaten since the strike began.

They are also expecting to have to deal with serious medical conditions plaguing those whose systems are weakened after fasting for weeks and who are now seeking to begin eating again.

The hunger strike is the latest difficulty to plague the state's prison system, which is under orders by a federal court to reduce crowding by the end of the year, possibly by releasing up to 10,000 inmates early.

Medical care in the prisons was taken away from the state as part of the same case, and placed under the control of a court-appointed receiver. Another court appointee is in charge of the system's mental health programs.

Among the complaints sending inmates to hospital are dehydration, cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness and lightheadedness, said Liz Gransee, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver overseeing care in the state's prisons.

"It can have long-term effects on your internal organs as your body is pretty much eating itself from the inside out," Gransee said, describing the effects of the hunger strike.

Prisoners launched the current hunger strike - the latest in a string of actions in recent years - in prisons statewide on July 8 to demand an end to a policy of housing inmates believed to be associated with gangs in near-isolation for years on end.

This strike, however, has already gone on twice as long as a similar action in 2011 and has attracted more prisoners - 30,000 at its peak - although numbers have since dramatically dwindled.

By the 40th day of refusing food, inmates would likely be suffering from a raft of medical and psychological issues, some of which might not be reversible, said Dr. Marc Hellerstein, who studies nutrition at the University of California, Berkeley.

"Everything shrinks and the body tends to starving and just about nothing else," he said. "They will have less judgment, they will have less interest, they will become socially withdrawn and isolated. They just want to curl up in a corner."

State Undersecretary for Corrections Martin Hoshino said California was working closely with the federal receiver overseeing prison care to handle medical issues as they arose.

"In my memory I can't think of a time when we were not in more lockstep with the receiver's medical teams and clinicians," he said, adding that inmate health was a top priority.

Hoshino confirmed that medical issues arising from the strike were a key concern right now, and that officials were bracing for more as prisoners continue to refuse food.

TROUBLED PRISONS

The latest hunger strike is aimed at conditions at four Secure Housing Units that house more than 4,500 inmates in near isolation, some for committing crimes while incarcerated and others because they are believed to be gang members.

The units, where many prisoners are kept in cells for 23 hours per day and allowed an hour of solitary exercise in an enclosed yard, have drawn attention from human rights activists, who say prisoners are harmed by lack of social interaction.

As the strike has lengthened, the federal receiver, J. Clark Kelso has stepped up monitoring and begun trying to encourage participants to eat, said Gransee.

The receiver's office did not release the total number of inmates who began eating again after falling ill, but strike participation is dropping: On Monday, 292 inmates were on strike, 144 continuously since the action began; by Thursday, 226 were striking, 118 continuously, officials said.

One inmate who had been involved in the hunger strike has died. William Sell stopped striking on July 21 and hanged himself the next day, but a corrections spokeswoman said the suicide was not related to fasting.

Along with the possible side-effects of prolonged fasting comes another danger when inmates begin to eat again. To avoid shocking the system, small meals are served to those who want to resume eating, and some are sent to hospitals, Gransee said.

The receiver is also encouraging hunger strikers to drink beverages that replace lost electrolytes and nutritional supplements such as Ensure, although inmates who take supplements are not counted as striking.

Dolores Canales, whose son John Martinez is serving 25 years to life for murder, said he lost weight and became weak, but was hopeful that media attention will lead to changes.

"He believes the system is terribly wrong, not just for the prisoners but for society in general," Canales said.

A West Virginia judge was arrested on Thursday and charged in federal court with attempting to plant evidence on a former lover's husband and having him arrested for a crime he did not commit.

Mingo County Circuit Judge Michael Thornsbury, 57, also was accused of appointing a business partner to be foreman of the grand jury investigating the husband, the indictment said.

Thornsbury, Mingo County's only circuit judge since 1997, was arrested on Thursday, according to a federal prosecutor. He was released after paying a $10,000 bond, according to court documents.

Thornsbury had a romantic relationship with his secretary starting in early 2008, the federal indictment said. After she broke it off in June of that year, Thornsbury sought retaliation against the woman's husband, it said.

The names of the woman and her husband were redacted from the indictment.

Thornsbury tried unsuccessfully to hire someone to plant drugs under the man's car so he would be arrested and later arranged to have the man unduly charged with stealing from his employer, according to the indictment.

The judge then allegedly appointed a business partner, who ran a commercial real estate development firm and a wine shop with him, to be foreman of the grand jury to continue investigating the man. He ultimately abandoned his effort when his ties to the foreman were discovered.

Later, in 2012, Thornsbury sought to have the same man charged with assault and sentenced to six months in jail following a fight initiated by two other men, the indictment said. The prosecutor ultimately dismissed the charges.

Thornsbury was charged with two counts of conspiring to violate the constitutional rights of the victim in regard to unreasonable arrest and right to due process.



headline: New Yorker arrested 29 times for transit crimes sentenced in bus theft
byline: By Victoria Cavaliere
8:31am EDT

A New York City man arrested nearly 30 times over 30 years for posing as a subway worker or bus driver, at times piloting trains full of unsuspecting commuters, was sentenced to up to 5 years in prison on Thursday for his latest joyride.

Darius McCollum, who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism, will seek treatment for his transit obsession upon his release from prison, under a plea deal with prosecutors, his lawyer said.

McCollum, 48, pleaded guilty this month to taking a Trailways bus in 2010 from a depot in Hoboken, New Jersey, and driving it to the city's Queens borough, apparently en route to John F. Kennedy International Airport, the Queens District Attorney's office said.

It was McCollum's 29th arrest since the age of 15.

He faced up to 15 years behind bars for the Trailways theft but as part of a plea deal with prosecutors, he was sentenced to 2-1/2 to 5 years in prison.

McCollum has been in jail for nearly 3 years and could face a parole board within weeks since he already has served the minimum of his sentence, his attorney Sally Butler said.

"The goal was to get him in front of a parole board as soon as possible, to get him out of the system and to get him some help," she said.

McCollum's obsession with mass transit, specifically with the city's subway system, started early in his life when he hid in a train after being violently attacked at school, she said.

"It was his home. It's was an environment where he feels safe," she said.

In 1981, McCollum was arrested for the first time after taking the controls of an E train and driving it six stops, apparently without any complaints from the conductor or passengers.

Over the next two decades, McCollum was arrested for a series of transit crimes, including dressing like a Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee and attempting - and at times succeeding - to drive trains and repair vehicles.

He also posed as a member of a crew working on tracks.

"He's done this way more times than he's been arrested," his attorney said.

Forensic experts testified in graphic detail on Thursday how soldiers suffered when they were shot by an army psychiatrist who has admitted opening fire at a Texas military base in 2009 because he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war on Islam.

Major Nidal Hasan, an American Muslim who faces 13 charges of premeditated murder and 32 charges of premeditated attempted murder in the attack at Fort Hood, Texas, has told mental health evaluators that he wanted to become a martyr while carrying out "jihad".

A pathologist, Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Berran, told Hasan's court-martial on Thursday that one soldier who tried to charge and stop Hasan was shot 12 times while another, Private First Class Aaron Nemelka, 19, the youngest military victim of the attack, suffered intensely as his organs filled with blood.

It was "not an immediately fatal wound," Berran said.

Berran is one of several expert witnesses who have testified this week about crime scene evidence and autopsy analyses of roughly 10 of the 13 victims who were sprayed with bullets, some shot while they were on the floor or elsewhere. More than 70 people have testified so far.

Private Francheska Velez, then 21 years old and six weeks pregnant, died after a single bullet pierced her back, severed a major vein, "went through the heart" and ended in the right lung, said Dr. AbuBakr Marzouk, another pathologist.

Witnesses said she pleaded for her unborn child's life, screaming "My baby! My baby!"

Another victim, 29-year-old specialist Frederick Greene, of Mountain City, Tennessee, was shot multiple times as he charged the shooter.

Several witnesses quoted Hasan, 42, as screaming "Allahu Akbar" ("God is greatest" in Arabic) as he sprayed gunfire with his laser-sighted handgun on unarmed fellow soldiers on November 5, 2009, at Fort Hood just days before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan.

'I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD'

Retired Major Clifford Hopewell, who was Chief of Traumatic Brain Injury and worked in a building near to where Hasan opened fire, testified on Thursday that he ran out of his office when he heard the thunder of bullets and people screaming.

He said he saw bodies strewn outside the building, scooped up a fallen magazine cartridge, and later encountered his psychiatrist colleague, Hasan.

"He was laying prone on the ground and he wasn't moving ... I thought he was dead," said Clifford, who was the first person to officially identify him to authorities.

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges. A review by a former FBI director found Hasan had exchanged emails with Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing. Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.

Base policy prohibits soldiers from carrying weapons, and military police eventually shot Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down.

He is acting as his own lawyer, attending court in a wheelchair and rarely cross-examining witnesses. He has raised no objections this week.

Standby defense lawyers assigned to assist Hasan have said they believe he is actively seeking the death penalty. According to a medical report, Hasan told a panel of evaluators he had hoped to die while carrying out "jihad" because it would make him a martyr. The prosecution is expected to wrap up early next week.

Hasan, who appears in court in a camouflage military combat uniform with a patch of the American flag on his right shoulder, told the jury on the opening day of the trial on August 6: "I am the shooter."

The 13-member jury of officers must unanimously find Hasan guilty of premeditated murder for him to be sentenced to death. The U.S. military has not executed a service member since 1961.

The military Judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, ended court earlier than planned on Thursday because Hasan told her he had been sitting upright since he woke up at 4 a.m. local time. He has to adjust himself frequently.

"Just let me know anytime you want a break" or are sitting upright for longer than you would like, Osborn said, adding the court had thus far accommodated him.



headline: Cyclist sentenced for manslaughter by bike in landmark California case

A bicyclist who fatally struck a pedestrian in San Francisco was sentenced to community service and probation on Thursday, after pleading guilty to felony vehicular manslaughter in what is believed to be the first such conviction in the United States.

After striking a plea deal to avoid jail time, Chris Bucchere, 37, was sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service and three years of probation for the death of 71-year-old Sutchi Hui last year, San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón said in a statement.

"Mr. Hui was a loving husband, father, and grandfather who tragically lost his life in an incident that could have easily been prevented," Gascón said. "Motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists must share the road in a responsible way because there are dire consequences when traffic laws are disregarded."

Gascón has said the case marked the first felony vehicular manslaughter conviction in the United States against a bicyclist. His office last year prosecuted a similar case as a lesser charge.

Bucchere, a software developer, was riding his bicycle downhill in March 2012 when he entered a crowded intersection in the city's Castro District and collided with Hui, who had been crossing the street with his wife. Hui died of his injuries four days later.

Bucchere had been riding at about 30 miles per hour (48 km per hour) at the time, said Alex Bastian, a spokesman for the District Attorney's Office. Investigations into the collision showed that Bucchere used a GPS-based application that allows cyclists to compare speed records on a route and set personal records.

Witnesses of the crash told authorities Bucchere ran through a red light before slamming into Hui, and those witness accounts were a tie-breaking factor in the decision to prosecute the case as a felony, Gascón has said.

The plea deal was reached after Hui's son told prosecutors he did not want Bucchere to serve jail time for his father's death, Gascón said. A felony conviction for vehicular manslaughter could have carried a maximum sentence of six years in prison under California law.

Another bicyclist pleaded guilty in San Francisco to misdemeanor manslaughter last year. That cyclist received 500 hours of community service and three years of probation for striking a 67-year-old woman who later died.

A judge can decide in six months whether Bucchere's conviction can be reduced to a misdemeanor, Gascón said. A call and email for comment to Bucchere's attorney, Ted Cassman, were not returned.



headline: SEC bars Conrad Black from U.S. directorships

standing lawsuit over Black's dealings as the head of the Hollinger media empire.

In its heyday, Hollinger International operated a raft of newspapers that included the Chicago Sun-Times, the Jerusalem Post, Britain's Daily Telegraph and the National Post in Black's native Canada. Black, 68, gave up Canadian citizenship when he became a member of Britain's House of Lords.

The final judgment by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission followed Black's appeal of an October 2012 SEC judgment that ordered him to pay $6.1 million. He was released from U.S. prison more than a year ago after serving a sentence for fraud and obstruction of justice.

The $4.1 million will be paid to Chicago Newspaper Liquidation Corp, formerly known as the Sun-Times Media Group, which was a Hollinger successor company in the United States.

Black was found guilty in 2007 of scheming with partner David Radler and other executives to siphon off millions of dollars from the sale of newspapers as they unwound Hollinger International.

But two of his three fraud convictions were later voided and his 78-month sentence was shortened to 42 months. He served 37 months, was released in May 2012 and now lives in Toronto.

"In the circumstances, and given the correlation of forces and the defamation I endured, it is a very happy ending," Black said in an email, noting that a libel suit related to the affair had ended in a settlement. "The collapse of the onslaught against me speaks for itself."

The SEC deal clears the way for the Ontario Securities Commission, Canada's major securities regulator, to proceed with its own case against Black and two other former Hollinger executives.

In a hearing scheduled to begin on Friday, the regulator wants to ban Black from buying or trading in securities and from becoming a director of a public company in Ontario.

Black described the OSC action as a "technical matter."

"I am not aware of any monetary claim, or of any ground for one," he said.



headline: Penn Staters protest wellness program's steep fines

and paying a $1,200 penalty if he doesn't comply.

An open letter Woessner wrote protesting the university's 2014 wellness requirements has sparked a protest by more than 2,000 faculty and staff employees at Penn State who argue that it is coercive and unethical and ask that it be stopped.

Studies show the $1,200 annual penalty is one of the most severe to be imposed by a U.S. employer, only 2 percent of which use fines alone, rather than rewards, to push staff to undergo medical testing, provide data on their health and otherwise participate in wellness programs.

Most of the opposition to the program focuses on what Woessner calls "the ethical ramifications of coercing employees to turn over private health information" to companies running the wellness program. But he and other faculty members have recently been contacted by experts in workplace wellness, pointing to studies showing that such programs, on average, save employers little, if anything, in healthcare costs and may even increase spending by forcing workers to undergo extra testing and schedule additional doctor visits.

"That gives me the sense that the administration hasn't weighed the program's costs, especially in employee morale and threats to privacy, against its benefits, which might be very small," said Woessner.

"The university is desperately trying to come up with money to cover the worst scandal in higher education (the conviction of coach Jerry Sandusky of sexually molesting children and the resulting $60 million fine and other sanctions). We have to wonder if the $1,200 penalty is a Sandusky tax."

University spokeswoman Annemarie Mountz said the wellness program is "totally unrelated" to the Sandusky sanctions, which are being paid out of a separate budget from the one that covers healthcare, and that the university's 2009 strategic plan included reining in healthcare costs.

Those costs are projected to top $217 million this academic year, $17.7 million more than last year, in a total budget of $4.4 billion. That works out to $5,425 per insured individual, compared with a U.S. average of $9,000. The university, which covers about 40,000 employees at campuses across the state, did not offer an explanation of why its costs are lower. It is self-insured, meaning it pays medical claims out of its own pocket.

'TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH'

Penn State gave its covered employees and spouses until October to comply with two key requirements of the new "Take Care of Your Health" wellness program: complete an online wellness profile from WebMD and undergo a preventive physical, including tests of cholesterol and glucose levels, and measurements of height, weight, and waist circumference.

Employees who fail to do both will have $100 per month deducted from their paycheck.

Penn State is hardly alone in turning to workplace wellness programs to reduce its healthcare spending; 51 percent of employers with more than 50 employees offer one. But results have been disappointing.

In a report requested by Congress and released in May, researchers at the RAND Corp., an independent think tank, found that the programs have only a modest effect on health. Employees who participate in workplace wellness programs lose, on average, one pound a year for three years, for instance, and participation "was not associated with significant reductions" in cholesterol level.

A key determinant in whether a wellness program will yield net savings is how much an employer spends on illnesses - such as smoking-related emphysema - that can be reduced by counseling, preventive care and other elements of wellness.

Averaged across all employees, those "wellness-sensitive events" cost employers $300 per person per year, said Al Lewis, president of the Disease Management Purchasing Consortium International, which helps employers reduce healthcare costs. Because wellness programs are not magic wands - they don't make every smoker quit or every obese person slim - they make only a small dent in that spending, which RAND estimated at $29 per person per year in the first year and $133 in the fourth, "both nonsignificant changes."

Highmark projected that the wellness program would keep cost increases to two percentage points above the rate of medical inflation which is 2.7 percent so far this year.

'INCREASED UTILIZATION'

page form, reviewed by Reuters, asks for data on glucose, cholesterol, weight, about feeling sadness or guilt, experiencing problems with friends or supervisors or finances, and a long list of screenings, all of which can trigger more doctors' visits, invasive tests and surgery that may not improve health.

"You're looking at increased utilization," said Vik Khanna, a healthcare consultant in St. Louis and editor of The Health Care Blog. "There can only be more claims if people fill these out."

More problematic, he said, the questionnaire includes items whose relevance to preventing disease has been dismissed by scientific studies. Women, for instance, are asked if they conduct regular breast exams. Men are asked if they perform regular testicular exams and when they last had a PSA test, which is supposed to detect prostate cancer.

The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends against all three measures. WebMD spokeswoman Kate Hahn said medical groups disagree about the value of various cancer screenings and that WebMD reviews its questionnaire annually, adding or deleting questions "to reflect changes in national standards."

As part of his campaign of "civil disobedience" against Penn State, Woessner is suggesting that employees refuse to have their physical at the mobile vans the university has hired and instead go to their own physician. For his last full physical in 2012, Penn State was billed $421, including $144 for blood work.

If the 2,000 staff (and their families) who signed a Change.org petition protesting the program took Woessner's advice, the university would be hit with more than $1.5 million in additional costs as a result of the wellness mandate.



headline: San Francisco-area bridge to open next month after quake fix
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

area's busiest bay bridge will open as planned in September, after a temporary fix was found to repair a system designed to withstand earthquakes, officials said on Thursday.

Structural problems with the new span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which carries 270,000 vehicles daily from San Francisco to the earthquake-prone area's eastern region, were found in March.

A bridge oversight committee voted unanimously on Thursday to allow a temporary structural fix to keep the original September 3 unveiling date of the span.

"This is an intra-measure that will not only meet, but exceed, the threshold for seismic safety while repairs are made," Bay Area Toll Authority spokesman John Goodwin said.

The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake brought down a part of the bridge, killing one person. The new section, which connects Yerba Buena Island to Oakland, has been under construction since 2002.

A survey in March discovered 32 of more than 2,300 steel rods used to help the 2.2-mile (3.5-km) eastern span of the bridge withstand earthquakes, were broken. The rods are part of a system designed to limit the horizontal movement of the bridge's decks in the case of an earthquake.

Following the discovery, officials ordered a retrofitting, estimated to cost between $5 million and $10 million, to replace the rods.

The bridge oversight committee said last month it would delay the opening of the bridge until December 10 to give construction crews more time to resolve the rods issue.

Thursday's vote allowed for placeholder steel plate stabilizers to be used while the rods are permanently replaced, Goodwin said.



headline: Great-grandmother accuses San Diego mayor of sexual harassment
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

grandmother became the latest of 16 women to publicly accuse San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of sexual harassment, as city officials calling for him to resign sought to turn up the pressure on the embattled politician.

Peggy Shannon, who earned $8 an hour in a part-time City Hall job providing information to senior citizens, said Filner repeatedly made unwanted advances toward her over a period of several months, asking for dates and once kissing her on the mouth. She did not give a specific timeframe for the alleged incidents.

On one occasion, she recounted, "Mayor Filner came by my desk and asked me if I thought he could go eight hours in one night. I was shocked that he would say that to me."

Shannon, a great-grandmother whose job supplemented her Social Security income, said Filner's behavior left her embarrassed and in tears, but she ultimately decided to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Investigations Office and to go public.

She did so at a news conference accompanied by attorney Gloria Allred, who also represents the mayor's former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, who filed a sexual harassment suit against Filner and the city on July 22.

At least 15 other women have come forward since then - Shannon being the latest - to accuse the 70-year-old Democrat and former congressman of groping and other sexually inappropriate behavior.

The allegations have prompted nearly every elected official in San Diego to call on Filner to resign as mayor of California's second-largest city, and a bipartisan campaign seeking his ouster through a recall election has been launched.

Filner has apologized for what he has acknowledged was a pattern of disrespectful and intimidating treatment of women, and said last month he would undergo two weeks of intensive behavioral counseling.

According to his lawyers, Filner completed his therapy on Saturday - about 10 days earlier than originally planned - and would continue counseling while remaining on personal leave for another week. Representatives for Filner could not immediately be reached for comment.

TALK OF REMOVAL

Meanwhile, the mayor has come under mounting scrutiny for his use of a city-issued credit card for what opponents describe as questionable expenses and for allowing city lobbying contracts to lapse for several months.

Those two issues have led to discussions among the city attorney and City Council members of possible moves to curtail Filner's powers as mayor or force his removal from office.

City Attorney Jan Goldsmith on Thursday publicly circulated a legal memo explaining a city charter provision that allows for an expedited lawsuit by the city, seeking the removal of any city official found to have made unauthorized expenditures of municipal funds.

Such a judgment would be rendered by a court, not by the City Council. But it would be up to the council to authorize the filing of a declaratory relief action at the City Attorney's request, Goldsmith, a Republican, wrote.

City Council President Todd Gloria, a Democrat, has said he believes such an action would be considered in closed session with the city attorney next Wednesday, said Katie Keach, deputy chief of staff for Gloria.

She said it was up to the city attorney to decide on what basis Filner might be sued for unauthorized payments from the city treasury. The city attorney's Office did not answer repeated requests for comment.

Republican Councilman Kevin Faulconer, a Republican and chairman of the audit committee, has called into question some $21,000 he said Filner spent using city credit cards on a June trip to Paris. Filner has promised to reimburse the city for those expenses.

The online newspaper U-T San Diego has reported the mayor ran up $11,000 in city credit card bills over several months for which he initially failed to submit required receipts, including nearly $1,000 deemed as personal expenses. The mayor's office has said he would repay those expenses.

Faulconer has set a hearing next month to review the mayor's credit card use, and Gloria has called on the mayor's office for an update on contracts for lobbyists who are paid to represent the city's interests in Sacramento and Washington, D.C.

Gloria has raised the idea of seeking to strip the mayor of intergovernmental responsibilities and turn those powers over to the City Council.



headline: Flight recorders retrieved from UPS cargo jet in Alabama

impact fire or engine failure, the National Transportation Safety Board said on Thursday.

The downed plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders were also retrieved.

The so-called black boxes will be sent to the NTSB headquarters in Washington for evaluation of possible clues about the cause of the fiery crash of the United Parcel Service Inc aircraft in which two pilots were killed, Robert Sumwalt, a senior NTSB official, told a press conference in Birmingham.

Sumwalt said the flight data and cockpit voice recorders were covered in debris and plastic that melted in the fire and then hardened onto them. It took three hours to dig them out.

Investigators hoped to get them opened later Thursday and should know by Friday whether the data is still good.

"They weren't made to be opened. They'll have to saw into them," Sumwalt said. "We are optimistic we will be able to obtain good data from those recorders."

He said there was debris in the engine that was apparently sucked in when the plane clipped the trees. It was "indicative of an engine coming through trees and striking dirt," Sumwalt said.

He said they would be also be looking at lighting and navigational issues that might be involved with the runway.

The cargo plane, an Airbus A300, clipped trees and nearly hit a house before plowing across about 200 yards of empty field well short of the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, the NTSB has said.

The pilots of UPS flight 1354 issued no emergency or distress calls before the plane crashed and burst into flames.

One of the doomed crew members has been identified as 37-year-old Shanda Fanning of Lynchburg, Tennessee, according to her local sheriff's office.

The other pilot has been identified as Cerea Beal Jr., a resident of the Charlotte, North Carolina, area, the Charlotte Observer newspaper said.

Kevin Hiatt, president and chief executive officer of the Flight Safety Foundation, an Alexandria, Virginia-based international watchdog group, said Birmingham-Shuttlesworth can be tricky to land at because it is nestled into surrounding hills.

That is especially true of Runway 18, which the UPS jet was approaching when it crashed into a tall hill at the north end of the airport, said Hiatt. A veteran former Delta Airlines pilot, Hiatt said he had touched down on the runway many times himself.

"It is not a full instrument landing. You have to visually fly into that runway. Sometimes it takes nuance to land there. You have to realize that hill is there or you could come in too low," Hiatt told Reuters.

The crash occurred shortly before dawn in rainy conditions as low-lying clouds hung over Birmingham.

"They were slanted south, coming in at a straight approach," Hiatt said of the ill-fated UPS pilots.

"Since there was no distress call, everything seemed to be progressing normally," he said. "They must have gotten blindsided by something that happened, perhaps with the engines."



headline: Running short of execution drug, Ohio considers new method
byline: By Kevin Murphy
8:31am EDT

Ohio plans to use a new drug or combination of drugs for executing inmates by lethal injection because its supply of pentobarbital is about to expire, according to a court filing.

Federal Judge Gregory Frost in Columbus, Ohio, disclosed the state's intentions in a court filing Monday, although the filing was not reported until Thursday. He did not say how the state would execute death row inmates. Frost said lawyers for the state discussed the issue in a conference call last week.

State lawyers said the new execution method would be in place by no later than October 4, in time for the scheduled execution of Ronald Phillips on November 14. It will not be in place in time for the scheduled execution of Harry Mitts, Jr. on September 25, the judge's order said.

The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction did not respond to a Reuters request on Thursday for comment on the filing.

Ohio and other states where capital punishment is legal have reported difficulty finding companies that manufacture pentobarbital. Ohio officials have said the state will run out by the end of September.

Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck LLC manufactures the drug and refuses to supply it for executions because the European Union, of which Denmark is a member, forbids the death penalty.

Frost's filing came as part of ongoing legal challenges filed by Ohio death row inmates.



headline: Michigan appeals court rules against unions in right-to-work case
byline: By Brendan O'Brien
8:31am EDT

The Michigan Legislature's right to create a law that bans mandatory union membership trumps the authority of a state agency that oversees public employment, an appeals court ruled on Thursday.

The state legislature passed the "right to work" law in December amid union protests in Lansing, dealing a stunning blow to organized labor in the state that is home to U.S. automakers and the symbol of industrial labor in the United States.

The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the legislature had the authority to create the law that makes union fees voluntary because it has the constitutional right to "speak for the people on matters of significant public concern."

Unions who brought the challenge argued the law intrudes on the power of the state's Civil Service Commission because the agency has the authority to "regulate all conditions of employment."

"We are deeply disappointed by the court's ruling, which, if it stands, will undermine Michigan's constitutional protections for state workers," Cindy Estrada, a vice president of United Auto Workers, said in a statement.

The UAW could appeal, the statement said.

Republican Governor Rick Snyder signed the right-to-work legislation in December 2012, making Michigan the 24th U.S. state to prohibit unions from requiring employees to join and contribute dues. It went into effect in March.

"As the law is written, public sector employees will receive the same freedoms and choices as private sector employees. Everyone will be treated equally," said Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette in a statement.

Labor unions in the United States have faced several major setbacks during the last two years, including collective bargaining reforms in Wisconsin and right-to-work legislation in Indiana.

Several other states and local governments have either made cuts or are considering cuts to the pensions of public sector workers because of financial difficulties.



headline: Detroit pension funds to object to city's bankruptcy
byline: By Bernie Woodall
8:31am EDT

Detroit's two public pension funds will file an objection on Monday to the city's bankruptcy filing on Michigan constitutional grounds, a representative of the pension boards said on Thursday.

The challenge expected from the pension funds is the first to emerge from among several parties likely to object to the city of Detroit's claim that it is bankrupt.

For Detroit's Chapter 9 bankruptcy to proceed U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing the case, must first find the city has proved it is insolvent and negotiated in good faith with its creditors, or that there were too many creditors to make negotiation feasible.

In a court filing earlier this month, Detroit released a list of creditors, including current, former and retired workers, that filled 3,504 pages. If Detroit is ultimately deemed eligible for municipal bankruptcy, it would be the biggest such case in U.S. history.

The city's two pension boards will claim that Michigan Governor Rick Snyder violated the state's Constitution when he allowed Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, to make the bankruptcy filing.

The pension boards also will claim Detroit violated state constitutional language that prohibits the impairment of vested retirement benefits for public workers, said Bruce Babiarz, spokesman for the Police and Firefighters Retirement System.

In a June 14 proposal to creditors, Orr called for "significant cuts in accrued, vested pension amounts for both active and currently retired persons."

Babiarz also said Monday's filing by the pension funds will include a provision seeking assurance that Judge Rhodes' approval of a city request to establish a committee to represent retired city workers during the bankruptcy process will not keep Detroit from negotiating directly with the pension boards.

Rhodes approved the creation of a creditors' committee August 2, despite concerns by trustees of the two pension boards that creation of a committee might undermine their ability to negotiate with the city, Babiarz said.

One of Detroit's pension boards manages the retirement system for Detroit's general service workers and the second one does the same for police and firefighters.

Orr claims that the unfunded liability of the two pension funds is five times what the pension funds claim.

Babiarz said representatives of Orr's office and the two pension boards will meet on Monday to discuss the retirement system's unfunded liability.

The constitutional arguments the pension funds are preparing appear similar to those made in lawsuits filed in state court aimed at derailing Detroit's bankruptcy. In a hearing on July 24, Judge Rhodes suspended those lawsuits and required all bankruptcy-related litigation to be heard in federal bankruptcy court.

The funds, along with creditors and other parties opposing Detroit's July 18 bankruptcy filing, have until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday to file their objections with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Detroit. Judge Rhodes has set October 23 for the commencement of a hearing process to determine if Detroit is eligible to file under Chapter 9.



headline: Florida A&M; University's famed band due to return from suspension
byline: By Bill Cotterell
8:31am EDT

Florida A&M; University's famed "Marching 100" band, suspended from performances for nearly two years after the beating death of a drum major in a hazing ritual, will return next month in the school's opening football game, officials said on Thursday.

"This is a new beginning," said Sylvester Young, director of marching and pep bands at the historically black college known as FAMU.

The band is scheduled to perform at the MEAC-SWAC Challenge game on September 1 when FAMU plays Mississippi Valley State.

The band was suspended after the death of Robert Champion, 26, who was severely beaten in an initiation tradition known as "Crossing Bus C" after a school football game on November 20, 201l.

He collapsed after being punched and kicked by band members in a darkened bus at a hotel parking lot in Orlando.

Former FAMU President James Ammons suspended the band indefinitely and former music director Julian White was ousted in the ensuing investigation, which resulted in criminal charges against some former band members. Hazing is illegal in Florida.

Current interim President Larry Robinson lifted the suspension in June, allowing students to enroll in band training and participate in tryouts and rehearsals, but officials held off deciding when the band would return public performances.

Robinson decreased the band's membership to 126 from more than 400, and the university hired a special assistant to help reduce violent behavior and held mandatory student training on hazing.

Students may only participate in the band for four years, they must have a 2.0 cumulative grade average and must have earned 24 credit hours in the past year.



headline: Ford to slash mileage rating on C-Max hybrid
byline: By Deepa Seetharaman
8:31am EDT

Max hybrid by up to seven miles per gallon, the company said Thursday, following complaints from consumers and industry experts that the model's actual mileage fell short of claims.

Because the issue of discrepancies between advertised EPA mileage ratings and real-world mileage affects a number of manufacturers, especially of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday said it planned to update its fuel-economy labeling regulations, in part to address those issues.

The EPA said the 2013 Ford C-Max would be relabeled under its new ratings system, to reflect estimated fuel economy of 40 miles per gallon on the highway, 45 mpg in the city and 43 mpg combined. Previously, the C-Max was rated at 47 mpg highway, city and combined.

Ford said it will send checks to C-Max customers to make up the difference in fuel costs - $550 to owners and $325 to lessees.

The EPA said it tested the C-Max after receiving consumer complaints that the vehicle did not achieve the label values of 47 mpg.

The move is a blow to the second-largest U.S. automaker, which has touted its superior fuel efficiency and been vocal in its desire to overtake Toyota Motor Corp as the leader of the U.S. hybrid segment.

But Ford's dilemma has implications for other manufacturers of hybrid vehicles, many of which have a reputation for falling well short of their advertised mileage.

Ford's announcement comes roughly 10 months after an EPA investigation showed that both Hyundai Motor Co and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp overstated their fuel economy by at least a mile per gallon.

General Motors, which sells a variety of hybrid vehicles, including the Chevrolet Volt, on Thursday said it will "work closely with the EPA on an improved process that can help deliver consumers reliable information backed by data."

Consumer Reports magazine said last year that the Ford C-Max and Fusion hybrids fell about 20 percent short of their promised fuel economy in road tests.

The automaker has faced several class action lawsuits that allege it overstated the gas mileage on its hybrids. Last month, it offered a free software update to boost the C-Max and Fusion hybrids' real-world economy.

Ford engineering boss Raj Nair said Thursday that under EPA rules the C-Max previously was lumped in the same family as the Fusion Hybrid, so both shared the 47 mpg rating. The 2014 C-Max, which is being tested separately, will received some hardware upgrades to improve its mileage.

The EPA on its website says its fuel-economy tests are "designed to reflect 'typical' driving conditions and driver behavior," but that its ratings "may not accurately predict" a vehicle's real-world mileage.

byline: By Mark Hosenball
8:31am EDT

Former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden began downloading documents describing the U.S. government's electronic spying programs while he was working for Dell Inc in April 2012, almost a year earlier than previously reported, according to U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the matter.

Snowden, who was granted a year's asylum by Russia on August 1, worked for Dell from 2009 until earlier this year, assigned as a contractor to U.S. National Security Agency facilities in the United States and Japan.

Snowden downloaded information while employed by Dell about eavesdropping programs run by the NSA and Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, and left an electronic footprint indicating when he accessed the documents, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.

David Frink, a spokesman for Round Rock, Texas-based Dell, declined to comment on any aspect of Snowden's employment with the company, saying Dell's "customer" - presumably the NSA - had asked Dell not to talk publicly about him.

Since Snowden disclosed documents on previously secret U.S. internet and phone surveillance programs in June, his three-month tenure with U.S. contractor Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp starting in late March of this year has been the focus of considerable attention. His time at Dell has received little attention.

Lawmakers have questioned how a relatively low-level systems administrator was able to gain access to so many top-secret documents without raising red flags. Some lawmakers have called the leaks one of the worst security breaches in U.S. history.

News that Snowden was downloading documents while he worked at Dell could increase pressure on U.S. intelligence agencies to tighten security protocols to prevent future leaks. The NSA has said it would tighten access to classified material and put in place stricter controls for accessing and downloading such information.

TRANSOCEANIC CABLES

Some of the material Snowden downloaded in April 2012 while a Dell employee related to NSA collection from fiber-optic cables, including transoceanic cables, of large quantities of internet traffic and other communications, the sources said.

Snowden has said he left Dell for a job at Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii around March of this year, specifically to gain access to additional top-secret documents that could be leaked to the media.

Booz Allen Hamilton fired Snowden after he fled to Hong Kong with a trove of secret material. The company has said it is cooperating with a number of inquiries into Snowden's hiring and security lapses.

It is not clear whether Dell has taken similar steps.

"We are honoring our customer's request that we not comment on this matter," said Frink, the Dell spokesman.

Two U.S. officials said the investigations into Snowden's activities confirmed that his downloading of sensitive information began at Dell. He is believed to have moved from Dell to Booz Allen with little time off in between.

In February 2010, while working for Dell, Snowden wrote in an internet technology forum, Ars Technica, that he was bothered by technology companies allegedly giving the U.S. government access to private computer servers.

"It really concerns me how little this sort of corporate behavior bothers those outside of technology circles," Snowden wrote under the screen name "The True HooHA." "Society really seems to have developed an unquestioning obedience towards spooky types.

In addition to a Justice Department investigation, which has produced criminal charges against Snowden, U.S. intelligence agencies are conducting an extensive inquiry to determine precisely what documents Snowden had access to, what he downloaded and how much damage his actions have caused.

A Colorado veterinarian has been cited for practicing medicine without a license after a treating a human patient who then had to have three toes amputated, police said on Thursday.

Francis Freemyer, who operates a small animal practice in Greeley, Colorado, was ticketed for "unauthorized practices," a misdemeanor, Greeley police said in a statement.

Police said they were investigating whether Freemyer, 78, may have also illegally treated other people. They did not explain what the patient was treated for.

The investigation began when medical staff at the North Colorado Medical Center contacted police in June to report that an unidentified patient claimed to have been treated by the veterinarian.

"Ultimately, the patient required surgery to remove three toes due to a lack of proper medical care," the statement said.

Freemyer did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment.

A review of state board of veterinary medicine disciplinary records showed that a Francis Freemyer, who has practiced veterinary medicine in Colorado since 1959, has twice been admonished by regulators.

In one instance, he was fined $1,500 for signing off on an inspection report that said he had examined and vaccinated 13 greyhounds when he had only examined 12 of the animals.

In another disciplinary action, Freemyer was fined $250 for failing to keep records of the examination and treatment of a cat in violation of "generally accepted standards of veterinary practice."



headline: New Jersey gay-marriage advocates argue their cause in state court

marriage advocates argued before a state judge on Thursday.

The arguments come in the first case to test whether the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act forces states to reconsider laws that restrict gay marriage, a dispute that could play out in courthouses across the country.

Judge Mary Jacobson, hearing the arguments in Mercer County Superior Court in Trenton, said she would not rule until September at the earliest.

Lawyers representing Governor Chris Christie, who vetoed same-sex marriage legislation last year, told Jacobson that the litigation is premature because the full effect of the Supreme Court's decision is not yet known.

Following the Supreme Court's June 26 ruling in U.S. v Windsor, advocates of same-sex marriage filed court papers in a dozen states, arguing that the legal landscape had changed and that certain state laws prohibiting gay marriage could no longer withstand scrutiny.

In a 5-4 ruling, Supreme Court found that DOMA violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law by denying gay married couples tax breaks and other federal benefits available to married heterosexuals.

Thursday's hearing was the latest skirmish in a legal battle that began in New Jersey more than a decade ago.

In 2006, New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples were entitled to the same rights as heterosexual married couples. That decision led the state legislature to pass a civil unions law meant to grant same-sex couples equal rights.

Lawyers for Garden State Equality, a gay rights advocacy group, told the judge on Thursday that the Supreme Court's decision applied only to marriages, not to civil unions.

As a result, they argued, the state's prohibition of same-sex marriage results in unequal treatment, in violation of the state Supreme Court's 2006 ruling, since those couples will not access to federal benefits available to married heterosexual couples.

"Federal benefits depend on marriage," said Garden State Equality attorney Lawrence Lustberg. "After Windsor, that is true whether the couples are of the same sex or different. That is what Windsor changed."

Kevin Jespersen of the New Jersey Attorney General's office said the burden is on federal agencies to respect the state's civil union law and confer the same benefits to same-sex couples. If that is not happening, the plaintiffs' quarrel is with the federal government, not New Jersey, he said.

"The New Jersey constitution cannot create a state remedy for the federal government acting under federal law," Jespersen said.

But Lustberg said that argument is misplaced.

"This case is about state action," he said. "It is the state, not the federal government, that is the source of the problem here."

The government also questioned whether the request for an immediate ruling was premature, given that federal agencies are still determining how to apply the DOMA decision to benefits.

"When you step into a very fast-moving stream, the footing is very uncertain," Jespersen said.

Lustberg, in response, cited several federal departments that have already said they will honor same-sex marriages, but not civil unions, when evaluating eligibility for benefits.

While the legal dispute continues, gay marriage advocates are pursuing a legislative remedy, pressing state lawmakers to override Christie's veto of the bill that would have legalized gay marriage.



headline: Another hostage dies, a day after Louisiana bank standoff ends

A woman who was taken hostage by a gunman at a Louisiana bank and shot by him as police attempted a rescue early Wednesday has died of her injuries, state police said on Thursday.

LaDean McDaniel was one of three bank employees held captive by a mentally ill 20-year-old gunman at the Tensas State Bank branch in St. Joseph, Louisiana.

Another hostage, Jay Warbington, had died at a nearby hospital shortly after the standoff ended, while a third hostage, Patricia White, was released unharmed.

Gunman Fuaed Abdo Ahmed was killed by police when they stormed the bank early on Wednesday to end the 12-hour standoff.

Ahmed did not have a permit to carry the semiautomatic pistol and semiautomatic rifle he carried into the bank, according to state police.

"He was only 20 years old, so he wasn't even eligible for a permit," said Captain Doug Cain, public affairs chief for Louisiana State Police, adding that the minimum age was 21.

Police have said that Ahmed suffered from a mental illness, paranoid schizophrenia, which also would have prevented him from obtaining a license to carry a gun under Louisiana law.



headline: Forensic experts testify to victims' suffering in Fort Hood rampage
byline: By Eric M. Johnson and Lisa Maria Garza
8:31am EDT

Forensic experts testified in graphic detail on Thursday how soldiers suffered when they were shot by an army psychiatrist who has admitted opening fire at a Texas military base in 2009 because he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war on Islam.

Major Nidal Hasan, a U.S.-born Muslim who faces 13 charges of premeditated murder and 32 charges of premeditated attempted murder, has told mental health evaluators that he wanted to become a martyr while carrying out "jihad."

A pathologist, Lt. Col. Phillip Berran, told Hasan's court-martial on Thursday that one soldier who tried to charge and stop Hasan was shot 12 times while another, Pfc Aaron Nemelka, 19, the youngest military victim of the attack, suffered intensely as his organs filled with blood.

It was "not an immediately fatal wound," Berran said.

Berran is one of several expert witnesses who have testified this week about crime scene evidence and autopsy analyses of roughly 10 of the 13 victims who were sprayed with bullets, some shot while they were on the floor or elsewhere. More than 70 people have testified so far.

Several witnesses quoted Hasan, 42, as screaming "Allahu akbar" ("God is greatest" in Arabic) as he sprayed gunfire with his laser-sighted handgun on unarmed fellow soldiers on November 5, 2009 at Fort Hood in Texas just days before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan.

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges. A review by a former FBI director found Hasan had exchanged emails with Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing. Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.

Base policy prohibits soldiers from carrying weapons and military police eventually shot Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down. He is acting as his own lawyer, attending court in a wheelchair and rarely cross-examining witnesses. He has raised no objections this week.

Standby defense lawyers assigned to assist Hasan have said they believe he is actively seeking the death penalty. According to a medical report, Hasan told a panel of evaluators he had hoped to die while carrying out "jihad" because it would signal God had designated him as a religious martyr.

Hasan told the jury on the opening day of the trial on August 6: "I am the shooter." Hasan said he "switched sides" in what he considered a U.S. war on Islam.

The 13-member jury of officers must unanimously find Hasan guilty of premeditated murder for him to be sentenced to death. The U.S. military has not executed a service member since 1961.



headline: Pentagon unveils measures to combat sexual assaults in the military
byline: By Andrea Shalal-Esa
8:31am EDT

The U.S. Defense Department on Thursday unveiled steps to combat sexual assaults in the armed forces by increasing protection for victims, beefing up oversight of investigations, and making responses to such crimes more consistent across the military.

"Sexual assault is a stain on the honor of our men and women who honorably serve our country, as well as a threat to the discipline and the cohesion of our force. It must be stamped out," Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a statement.

Hagel said he would continue to meet weekly with senior Pentagon leaders to review the broad effort to eliminate a problem that has plagued the military for decades.

The Pentagon reported in May that there had been a 37 percent increase in cases of unwanted sexual contact in the military from 2011 to 2012, with 26,000 people reporting everything from groping to rape, up from 19,000 a year earlier.

Sixty people have been removed from jobs as military recruiters, drill instructors and victims counselors since the report. Hagel announced first steps in May.

"The initiatives announced today are substantial, but only a step along a path toward eliminating this crime from our military ranks," said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

"The President expects this level of effort to be sustained not only in the coming weeks and months, but as far into the future as necessary," Carney said. "None of our men and women in uniform should ever have to experience the pain and degradation of sexual assault."

Senator Kirsten Gilliband, a New York Democrat, called the Pentagon's announcement a "positive step" and said more work was needed to rebuild trust in a system that resulted in just 302 prosecutions out of 26,000 reported sexual assault cases.

"We have to attack that because, frankly, we want increased, unrestricted reporting," said Lieutenant General Curtis Scaparrotti, director of the Joint Staff. "And we can only get that if we (have) the trust of our victims."

Scaparrotti said the initiatives standardized some best practices already being used by the military, but suggested more could be done.

He acknowledged a strong correlation between sexual assaults and alcohol use, but said the military was not taking steps at this time to standardize measures being implemented at various bases that limited alcohol sales.

"At least in the meetings I've been in, we've not discussed it in the form of making it common across the services," Scaparrotti told reporters. "We've generally left it ... to the command at this point, but we could take that on."

The measures announced on Thursday include creation of a legal advocacy program in each military service that would provide legal representation throughout the judicial process for sexual assault victims, and a guarantee that pretrial investigative hearings of sexual assault-related charges were conducted by judge advocates general (JAG) officers.

They also give commanders options for reassigning or transferring accused sexual offenders to eliminate continued contact with victims, thereby addressing a major concern that had been raised by victims. And they require general officers to be notified about reported crimes.

The Department of Defense also agreed to allow victims to give input during the sentencing phase of a court martial.

An independent panel, as mandated by Congress in the fiscal 2013 defense spending law, will be created to review and assess the military's entire process for investigating and prosecuting crimes involving sexual assault under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.



headline: Introducing the olinguito, the newest mammal discovery
byline: By Environment Correspondent Deborah Zabarenko
8:31am EDT

is the newest mammal and the first carnivore discovered in the Americas in 35 years, the Smithsonian Institution announced on Thursday.

Native to the high, misty cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador, the olinguito is the smallest member of the raccoon family, according to Kristofer Helgen, a Smithsonian scientist who recognized it as a distinct species 10 years ago.

The "aha" moment occurred not in a South American forest but at Chicago's Field Museum, the creature's discoverer, Helgen said at a news briefing.

"I pulled out a drawer ... and said 'Wow,'" Helgen recalled of his first view of a long-dead 20th century specimen, which had been identified as a related species, the olingo. "It was like nothing I'd ever seen before."

Helgen said the teeth and skull of the specimen were much different from those of an olingo, which is larger and has more prominent ears than the olinguito.

He said he could have published this finding in a scientific journal then, but in the interest of being thorough, he sought out colleagues to confirm the existence of the new species in its natural habitat.

Olinguitos are considered carnivores, even though they eat mostly fruit, Helgen said. These creatures have teeth that look fully capable of eating meat, he added.

They have thick, woolly fur that is brighter than that of the more drab-colored Olingos. Olinguitos are about 2.5 feet (.76 meter) long and weigh about 2 pounds (900 grams). Males and females are about the same size, and females raise a single baby at a time, the scientists said.

NEW TO SCIENCE, NOT TO ZOOS

Olinguitos are hard to spot in the cloud forests of the northern Andes, which are thickly wooded and often shrouded in fog or mist with elevations of 5,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level. Largely nocturnal, they spend most of their time in the forest canopy and are adept at jumping from tree to tree.

Helgen and his team closely observed the animal's habits and environment. Andean cloud forests are considered unique ecosystems because of the variety of species they support, but they are being deforested to make way for agriculture, urbanization and the illegal drug trade.

The team estimated that 42 percent of the olinguito's historic habitat has been converted to human use, but Helgen stressed that the new species is not highly endangered.

While the olinguito is new to science, with an official name of Bassaricyon neblina, it has been seen by humans and misidentified for decades. It was identified by genetic analysis at the National Zoo in Washington. The research was published on Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal ZooKeys.

One olinguito misclassified as an olingo even made a tour of U.S. zoos in the 1960s and 1970s, dying in 1976 at the Bronx Zoo without ever breeding.

"She wasn't being picky, it just wasn't the same species," Helgen said.

The discovery of the olinguito was part of a comprehensive study of olingos. Helgen said that in the course of this project he and his team have made what they believe to be even bigger discoveries, but it could take another decade to announce them.

area landlady and burying his dismembered remains in a backyard.

Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, acting as his own lawyer after he fired his attorneys in June, professed his innocence in court as a Los Angeles judge pronounced the maximum sentence faced by the defendant.

"Your honor, I can only say once again, I want to assert my innocence. I did not commit this crime," the soft-spoken, bespectacled defendant, dressed in blue prison garb, told the judge before he was escorted from the courtroom in handcuffs.

Under the life sentence imposed, Gerhartsreiter would be eligible for parole in 27 years.

Sitting alone at the defense table, he also muttered under his breath an assertion that he has long maintained but which a jury rejected when he was found guilty of first-degree murder in April - that the victim, John Sohus, 27, was killed by his own wife.

Sohus' buried remains were discovered in 1994 in the backyard of the home he shared with his spouse, Linda, in the Los Angeles suburb of San Marino.

The couple were reported missing 28 years ago while Gerhartsreiter was renting a guest house on the property from John Sohus' mother and living under the guise of a British aristocrat named Christopher Chichester.

By the time John Sohus' remains were unearthed by a work crew preparing to build a swimming pool on the property for a new owner, Gerhartsreiter had resurfaced on the East Coast under other assumed names. Linda Sohus remains missing and is presumed dead.

Gerhartsreiter was not charged in her death, but prosecutors have accused him of trying to create the appearance that the couple were traveling abroad after they vanished by arranging for forged postcards to be sent from Paris to their friends and relatives in the United States.

Reading a victim-impact statement before Gerhartsreiter was sentenced, John Sohus' sister, Ellen, implored the judge, "You cannot bring back my brother, but you can make a statement about the value of his life."

She recalled her brother as being "indescribably happy" the last time she saw him and his wife alive. Gerhartsreiter appeared unmoved by her statement and his demeanor was serenely calm throughout the 45-minute hearing.

Gerhartsreiter's double life unraveled after he was arrested in 2008 for abducting his young daughter in Boston following a bitter divorce and was revealed to have passed himself off for 16 years as a member of the Rockefeller clan, gaining entry into high society.

He was convicted in 2009 of kidnapping and assault and battery and was serving a four-year prison sentence in Massachusetts when authorities in Los Angeles charged him with the Sohus slaying.

The case against Gerhartsreiter, who came to the United States from Germany as a student in the 1970s, has drawn so much attention that his story became the subject of a 2010 made-for-TV movie titled "Who is Clark Rockefeller?"

Judge George Lomeli also denied a handwritten motion by Gerhartsreiter seeking a new trial, saying there was no basis to grant one, and also refused to reduce his prison term by the amount of time he had already served.



headline: Denver Bronco Von Miller arrested for missing court appearance
byline: By Keith Coffman
8:31am EDT

pro linebacker Von Miller, who is appealing his suspension for violating the NFL's drug policy, was arrested on Sunday at a Colorado gun shop for failing to appear in court for traffic violations, police said on Wednesday.

Miller, 24, was arrested after the Colorado Bureau of Investigation notified police that he was in the store and had an outstanding warrant, according to documents released by the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office.

Undersheriff David Walcher said Miller was taken into custody by deputies on Sunday, booked and released after paying a $1,000 bond. Walcher said he did not know what triggered the law enforcement notification.

Susan Medina, spokeswoman for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, said the agency cannot comment on specific cases, but under Colorado law anyone attempting to purchase a gun must undergo a background check, which could reveal any outstanding warrants.

The 6-foot 3-inches (1.91-metre), 250-pound (113-kg) Miller, who was the second overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft, was cited in October in suburban Denver for driving without a license, careless driving and failure to provide proof of insurance.

He skipped his December court date, and a warrant was then issued.

The Broncos posted a brief statement on the team's website, saying they were aware of the arrest of the third-year pro out of Texas A&M; University, who has twice been selected a Pro Bowl outside linebacker.

"It was reported to the league earlier this week and is being handled through the legal system," the statement said.

The news of his arrest came a day before Miller was scheduled to appear before NFL officials to appeal a four-game suspension the league handed down to him for violating its substance abuse policy.

Miller's arrest is the latest off-field embarrassment for the Broncos, who were eliminated in last season's play-offs by the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens.

Two of the team's front office executives were suspended without pay by the team in July after they were arrested in separate incidents on driving under the influence charges.



headline: Manning tells court he's 'sorry' for U.S. secrets breach to WikiLeaks
byline: By Ian Simpson
8:31am EDT

U.S. soldier Bradley Manning on Wednesday told a military court "I'm sorry" for giving war logs and diplomatic secrets to the WikiLeaks website three years ago, the biggest breach of classified data in the nation's history.

"I am sorry that my actions hurt people. I'm sorry that they hurt the United States," the 25-year-old U.S. Army Private First Class told the sentencing phase of his court-martial. "I am sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions ... The last few years have been a learning experience."

Manning spoke quietly and non-defiantly in his first extensive public comments since February.

Manning faces up to 90 years in prison for providing more than 700,000 documents, battle videos and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, hurling the pro-transparency website and its founder, Julian Assange, into the world spotlight.

Defense lawyers seeking a milder sentence rested their case on Wednesday after Manning's statement. With about a dozen witnesses including Army superiors, mental health professionals and Manning's own sister, they sought to show Judge Colonel Denise Lind that commanders ignored signs of mental stress.

An Army psychologist testified at the hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, that Manning, who is gay, felt isolated because he was wrestling with his gender identity. Another mental health specialist testified that Manning had hoped to end war.

"I should have worked more aggressively inside the system ... Unfortunately, I can't go back and change things," Manning, wearing his dress uniform and glasses, his hair in a crew cut, said from the witness stand.

He did not appear to be reading from notes and looked at the judge and around the room as he spoke.

"I understand I must pay a price for my decisions," Manning continued in his first lengthy public statement since February. "I want to be a better person, to go to college, to get a degree and to have a meaningful relationship with my sister and her family."

Manning was convicted of 20 charges, including espionage and theft, on July 30. He was found not guilty of the most serious count, aiding the enemy, which carried a life sentence.

A military spokesman said the judge would most likely sentence Manning next week at the earliest.

Prosecutors, who have argued that Manning was an arrogant soldier who aided al Qaeda militants and harmed the United States with the release of the documents, will have an opportunity to rebut the defense case on Friday.

'HYPER-MASCULINE ENVIRONMENT'

Captain Michael Worsley, who treated Manning from December 2009 to May 2010 during his deployment in Iraq, testified that the stress Manning had felt from his job as a low-level intelligence analyst was compounded by being in a "hyper masculine environment" of a combat zone.

"Being in the military and having a gender identity issue does not exactly go hand in hand," Worsley said. "You put him in that kind of environment, this hyper masculine environment ... with no coping skills, the pressure would have been incredible."

That pressure reached a peak when Manning punched another soldier, Worsley said. He said he had met infrequently with Manning and had no input from his superiors until the punching incident.

Navy Reserve Captain David Moulton, a forensic psychiatrist, said he had diagnosed Manning as having gender dysphoria, or wanting to be the opposite sex, as well as narcissism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. Those problems were compounded by the unraveling of a romantic relationship, the stress of serving in a Baghdad combat base and post-adolescent idealism, he said.

"Manning was under the impression that the information he was giving was going to change the way the world saw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and future wars, actually," said Moulton, who interviewed Manning for about 21 hours and spent more than 100 hours on the case.

'NO WAR WAS WORTH IT'

The psychiatrist said Manning thought it "would lead to a greater good. Society as a whole would come to the conclusion that the war wasn't worth it, that no war was worth it."

Manning's sister, Casey Major, 36, of Oklahoma City, testified about how her parents' alcoholism and infighting compelled her to play a lead role in raising her brother.

She recounted their early days together in Crescent, Oklahoma, reviewed family photos, and said, "I just hope he can be who he wants to be. I just hope he can be happy."

Troubles at home prompted a teenaged Manning to move to Potomac, Maryland, to live with his aunt, said Debra van Alstyne, the aunt who took him in. She recalled that Manning had joined the Army in the hope of going to college on the GI bill, after having difficulty balancing classes and a job at Starbucks.

The material Manning released that shocked many around the world was a 2007 gunsight video of a U.S. Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Baghdad. A dozen people were killed, including two Reuters news staff. WikiLeaks dubbed the footage "Collateral Murder."

Manning, described by his superiors as an Internet expert, faces the prospect of decades of monotonous prison life - with no online access - once he is sentenced.

vehicle crash that killed six members of a family including four children, authorities said on Wednesday.

Hector Ramirez, 18, will be arrested and charged once he is released from the hospital, Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said in a statement.

Seven family members, including two girls and three boys along with two adults, were traveling in a Chevrolet Suburban when it was struck at an intersection by the stolen pickup truck Ramirez was driving on Monday, according to the department.

The accident occurred near the city of Mission, close to the Texas-Mexico border. Among those killed were four children under the age of six. A man, two women and two boys, aged 5 and 8, were also injured in two other vehicles involved in the crash.

Ramirez attempted to flee the scene after the crash but was captured and remains in a local hospital, the department said.

Investigators said Ramirez stole the truck from a nearby town.



headline: Missouri Supreme Court sets execution dates for two death row inmates
byline: By Kevin Murphy
8:31am EDT

The Missouri Supreme Court set execution dates on Wednesday for two death row inmates after suspending the decision a year ago due to concerns over the type of drug the state wants to use in executions.

The court's order did not explain why it has decided to set the execution dates. Last year, the court stayed the executions because of a legal challenge in federal court over Missouri's use of the sedative propofol as the lethal drug of choice.

A group of death row inmates in Missouri have argued in lawsuits that the drug, which was blamed for the 2009 death of pop star Michael Jackson, causes pain and is cruel and unusual punishment. Missouri revised its execution protocol in 2012 to include the drug but has not held an execution since.

The state Supreme Court set an October 23 date for the execution of Allen Nicklasson and a November 20 date for the execution of Joseph Franklin, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said on Wednesday.

Nicklasson was found guilty of murder in 1996 and Franklin of murder a year later.

The attorney general asked the court on July 1 to set the execution dates for Nicklasson and Franklin because the state's remaining supply of propofol would expire next year. At the time, Koster called the pending litigation "an artificial hurdle" to block imposition of the death penalty.

"We are pleased that the court has re-examined the issue, and granted the motions," Koster said. "The death penalty remains a legal punishment in our state. By setting these execution dates, the court has taken an important step to see that justice is finally done for the victims and their families."

Last month, Koster said continued delays in Missouri executions could force state lawmakers to find alternative methods of putting prisoners to death.

The state might even have to resort to the gas chamber as the only other authorized form of execution in the state, he said.

Nicklasson was convicted of shooting motorist Richard Drummond, who stopped on Interstate 70 to help him and two other men whose car broke down. One of those men, Dennis Skillicorn, was executed in 2009.

Franklin was convicted in 1997 of shooting Gerald Gordon to death in the parking lot of a St. Louis-area synagogue after a bar mitzvah, Koster said.

He was also convicted for the murders of two joggers in Utah and a couple in Wisconsin, Koster said.



headline: Ex-U.S. congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. sentenced to 30 months in prison
byline: By Lacey Johnson
8:31am EDT

1/2 years in prison for misuse of campaign funds.

Jackson, a former Democratic representative and the son of civil rights leader the Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr., apologized before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced him on Wednesday.

Jackson, 48, had pleaded guilty in February to misusing about $750,000 in campaign funds on luxuries such as fur capes, celebrity memorabilia, mounted elk heads and a Rolex watch.

"I misled the American people," Jackson said at the hearing. "I also want to apologize to my dad and my mother," Jackson said, wiping away tears. "I take responsibility for my actions and I'm very sorry for what I have done," he said.

His wife, Sandi, a former Chicago city council member, was sentenced to one year for falsifying tax returns that failed to report the campaign money as income. The couple has two children.

The judge ordered Jackson Jr. to report to prison on or after November 1 and for Sandi Jackson to report to prison 30 days after he is released to reduce the impact on the children.

"I stand before you today asking for mercy," Sandi Jackson said, adding that "my heart breaks every day with the pain it has caused my babies."

Jackson Jr. asked on Monday that the judge recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that he serve his time at a federal prison in Montgomery, Alabama, because it would allow him to be nearer to his wife and children who live in Washington D.C. The judge said Wednesday she would make that recommendation.

Jackson Jr. served in Congress from 1995 until he resigned after re-election last year, citing health reasons.

He disappeared from public view in the summer of 2012 and speculation swirled for weeks about his condition. At first Jackson Jr. said he was being treated for exhaustion, and his doctor said in July 2012 said he was being treated for a "mood disorder."

He eventually was treated for at least six weeks at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for bipolar disorder.

Jackson Jr. also was sentenced to three years supervised release and ordered to perform 500 hours of community service. Sandi Jackson was given 12 months supervised release and 200 hours of community service.

Prosecutors had recommended a sentence of four years for the ex-congressman and 18 months for Sandi Jackson.

U.S. prosecutors asked in June that two of the Jacksons' houses, in Washington and Chicago, be subject to forfeiture, along with a bank account holding $80,000, as part of a $750,000 judgment.

Prosecutors asked in a filing this month that the forfeiture motion be delayed until October 25 since Jackson has said he is trying to pay off the judgment.

'HALL OF SHAME' CONTENDER?

The Reverend Jackson told reporters afterward that it has been an "extraordinarily difficult" time for the family.

"Jesse's been very sick," Reverend Jackson said. "This time a year ago, I really thought we may have lost him. I think he's strong enough now to accept the challenges put before him by the judge."

Dozens of letters to the judge were filed in the court docket before the sentencing. They included ones from Jackson Sr., ordinary people who had met the congressman only once and Democratic Representative Marica Fudge, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, asking for clemency.

Most letter writers expressed outrage at the couple's behavior and asked for the maximum punishment as a way to combat persistent corruption in Illinois and in Chicago's Cook County.

"Cook County is likely the most corrupt county in the most corrupt state and the self-serving greed displayed by Mr. Jackson over several years in office qualifies him for the Illinois Hall of Shame," Cook County resident Kenneth Kunka wrote.

A series of online chat posts attributed to Hannah, but which could not be immediately verified by Reuters, said she did not try running from her captor because he threatened to kill her, and that the kidnapper, James Lee DiMaggio, "deserved what he got" when he was slain.

The posts also seem to reveal details about the slayings of Hannah's mother and brother, whose remains were found in the ruins of DiMaggio's house at the outset of her disappearance. Hannah posted that they burned to death in a fire DiMaggio set off with a timer device after taking her captive.

The San Diego-area teenager has remained in seclusion since her abductor, a 40-year-old longtime family friend who worked as a computer technician, was shot dead by FBI agents who rescued her on Saturday.

On Monday night, she appeared to surface on the website ask.fm, a chat platform that lets users create a profile in which they can answer questions posed anonymously by others.

CBS News said the mother of one of Hannah's closest friends confirmed that the postings, accompanied by photos Hannah apparently took of herself, were hers.

They appeared on the ask.fm page for hannahbanana722 - a number that coincides with her July 22 birthday - from the San Diego suburb of Lakeside, where she lived with her mother, Christina Anderson, 44, and younger brother, Ethan. Her father, Brett Anderson, resides in Tennessee.

Cellphone snapshots of Hannah posted on the site on Monday night and a history of chats documented before the kidnapping - with a 10-day gap that began the day she was last seen - appeared to support the postings' authenticity.

By Wednesday morning, the account had been disabled. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department said it was aware of the posts but declined to comment on them. Members of the Anderson family could not immediately be reached for comment.

In the postings, Hannah said she was relating her account to dispel misunderstandings about the ordeal, including suggestions that she willingly accompanied her abductor.

Asked why she didn't run, she answered: "He would have killed me."

'HE TRICKED US'

The search for Hannah began after authorities found her mother and 8-year-old brother dead in DiMaggio's burned-out home east of San Diego on the night of August 4. Investigators have not said how Christina and Ethan Anderson were killed.

Asked if they were burned alive, Hannah answered: "Yes." She said she was not at the house when her mother was killed. Asked where she was when the "fire went off," she replied, "On the road to Idaho."

DiMaggio, she wrote, had somehow rigged his home to "catch on fire at a certain time."

Hannah said that she, her brother and mother had been lured to DiMaggio's home by a ruse: "He told us he was losing his house because of money issues, so we went up there one last time to support him ... but he tricked us."

Describing how she ended up separated from her mother and brother before her abduction, she said, "He tied them up in the garage," but she declined to give further details.

NBC News reported on Wednesday night that according to newly unsealed search warrants in the case, police believe DiMaggio tortured Christina and Ethan Anderson before killing them. The documents show that a crow bar and blood were found near Christina Anderson's body, NBC said.

DiMaggio and Hannah were ultimately tracked down on Saturday in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness in rural Idaho after a group of horseback riders reported that they had encountered the pair there earlier in the week.

Authorities said DiMaggio was armed with a rifle and had fired at least one shot before he was killed by FBI agents in a confrontation. Preliminary autopsy results found he was struck by at least five gunshots to his head, chest and extremities, said Nathan Hess, the coroner for Valley County, Idaho.

In the ask.fm posts, Hannah said she did not try alerting the group of riders that she was in distress because, "I had to act calm. I didn't want them to get hurt. I was scared that he would kill them."

She also wrote: "He had a gun and threatened to kill me and anyone who tried to help."

Asked if she could explain why DiMaggio did what he did, she responded, "Because he's physco (sic)."

Authorities have not publicly discussed any possible motives for DiMaggio's actions. A family friend has said the suspect developed an apparent infatuation with the high school girl that made Hannah feel uncomfortable.

"Why didn't you tell your parents he creeped you out," she was asked online. Her answer: Because he was a close family friend and her dad's best friend and, "I didn't want to ruin anything between them."



headline: Prosecutor quotes accused California serial killer to close case
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

old serial killer Joseph Naso on Wednesday by quoting from what she said were his journal entries about sexual assaults and his list of victim dumping grounds.

"Kansas City girl. Great legs in nylons, heels. Had to rape her in my car on a cold winter night, snowstorm," Deputy District Attorney Rosemary Slote told the court, reading from Naso's handwritten dairies dating back to the 1950s.

Naso, who is acting as his own attorney, could face the death penalty if convicted of killing more than one of four northern California prostitutes in the "alphabet murders," so called because the first and last name of each victim begins with the same letter.

He has admitted a penchant for photographing women in nylons and high heels but denies killing anyone.

Two victims, Roxene Roggasch, 18, and Carmen Colon, 22, were slain in the 1970s. Two others, Pamela Parsons, 38, and Tracy Tafoya, 31, were killed in the 1990s.

Probation officers arrested Naso in 2010 after searching his Nevada home and finding hundreds of photographs of scantily clad women, some appearing dead or unconscious. Also found was what prosecutors described as diaries of sexual assaults and a list of victim dumping grounds, triggering the murder investigation.

"He selects a specific type of victim," Deputy District Attorney Rosemary Slote told the jury. "He isolates the victim, kills the victim by strangulation, transports her to a rural area, dumps her body, and then he documents his crimes."

'GIRL NEAR LOGANITAS'

Naso, who is scheduled to present his closing argument on Friday, wore a sports jacket and tie to court and sat with his hands crossed or put on reading glasses and hunched over a table to take notes. His defense relies largely on his contention that he was a professional photographer.

But Slote read a dairy entry that appeared to counter that position. "Rochester, late 1950s," the entry said. "Picked up a cute Ukrainian girl ... Great legs. Used to take photos of her ... In those days I would pose as a professional photographer. What a scam."

The strongest evidence against Naso stems from the murder of Roggasch. Her body, dressed only in inside-out pantyhose, was found in rural Marin County in 1977. For more than 30 years, police had no leads to the killer of the freckle-faced redhead who worked as a prostitute out of Oakland.

But investigators used a list found in Naso's home to re-open old cases and take a new look at what happened to the young prostitute dumped near the town of Lagunitas. The third entry on Naso's handwritten list of 10 says, "Girl near Loganitas."

Roggasch was found with a pair of nylon stockings wrapped around her neck, another pair wrapped around her mouth and a third stuffed into her mouth, Slote said.

The coroner said she was strangled with nylons containing DNA from Naso's ex-wife. DNA in semen found in the crotch of the pantyhose Roggasch was wearing matched Naso's, Slote said.

Colon's naked, decomposed body was discovered in rural Contra Costa County in 1978. Investigators clipped and saved the young woman's fingernails. In 2010, tests showed evidence of Naso's DNA in the fingernail clippings, Slote said.

Investigators discovered obituaries for Parsons and Tafoya, along with sexually suggestive photographs of them, in Naso's safety-deposit box.

headline: Two killed in fiery Alabama crash of UPS cargo jet
byline: By Verna Gates
8:31am EDT

A large UPS cargo plane crashed and burst into flames, killing its pilot and copilot as it lit up the predawn sky over Alabama on Wednesday.

The cause of the latest aircraft accident in the United States was not immediately known and authorities were not releasing the identities of the two crew members killed.

The plane, an Airbus A300, clipped trees and nearly hit a house before plowing across about 200 yards (meters) of an empty field short of the runway, a senior official with the National Transportation Safety Board said.

Pictures from the scene showed the partially crumpled nose section of the aircraft still largely intact, emblazoned with the words Worldwide Services. But it was completely severed from the body of the aircraft and surrounded by debris, including UPS packages from the belly of the cargo hauler.

The NTSB official, Robert Sumwalt, said investigators had still not been able to retrieve the A300's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, about 12 hours after the crash occurred, because fire crews were still dousing the wreckage.

"The tail section of the aircraft is still smoldering, still smoking," Sumwalt told reporters.

The tail and wing sections ended up about 75 to 80 yards ahead of the cockpit, he added.

United Parcel Service Inc flight 1354, which took off from Louisville, Kentucky, was on approach to the airport in Birmingham when it crashed at about 5 a.m. CDT (1000 GMT), according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

One of the doomed crew members was identified as 37-year-old Shanda Fanning of Lynchburg, Tennessee, according to her local sheriff's office.

A 26-member NTSB response team from Washington is leading the investigation into the crash, Sumwalt said. UPS has not yet disclosed the nature of the cargo.

No distress calls were made to the airport tower, according to April Odom, a spokeswoman for Birmingham Mayor William Bell.

"It sounded like a transformer that blowed up," said Odell Rich, a fruit vendor who said he witnessed the crash. "There was a big explosion that lit up the sky. It jarred the earth. It looked to me like it hit a power line and plowed into the ground."

An intense fire erupted after the crash but it was quickly brought under control, Bell said. "It was quite a large fire and there were two to three explosions after the plane caught fire, after the crash itself," he said.

Pedro Torres, who lives about two blocks from the crash site, saw "a big flash" from the window of his home when the plane went down. He said the crash was preceded by the sound of what he described as "a backfire" and the noise of an engine with an open throttle.

"My house shuddered like an earthquake. I saw a big airplane on the ground, scattered everywhere with lots of smoke," he said.

A field of debris could be seen around the crash site in an area of Birmingham where many homes have been bulldozed to make way for an airport expansion.

PREVIOUS INCIDENTS

UPS, the world's largest package delivery service, declined to immediately comment on reports that the A300 involved in the crash had a record of previous mechanical and structural issues, some of which caused emergencies to be declared during flight.

A FAA database showed that the "service difficulty" issues, which date back to 2006, included a problem with an air data computer and a malfunction of the plane's flap system.

The Airbus A300 is a wide-body jet widely used as a regional freighter by UPS, FedEx Corp and others.

Airbus said it will provide technical assistance to accident investigators. It said the aircraft involved was delivered to UPS from its production line in 2003, and had accumulated about 11,000 flight hours over about 6,800 flights.

The model has been involved in about 10 crashes, the latest occurring last November, when the front landing gear on a DHL-owned jet collapsed on landing in Bratislava, Slovakia. The model has been in service since 1974.

The Birmingham crash is the latest in a string of air accidents in the United States in recent months.

In July, an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 crashed while landing in San Francisco, killing three people and injuring more than 180.

Also last month, the front landing gear of a Southwest Airlines Co Boeing 737 jet collapsed on touchdown at New York City's LaGuardia Airport, injuring eight.

In May, a U.S. Airways flight made a belly landing at Newark International Airport in New Jersey after its landing gear failed to deploy. No one was injured.



headline: California Supreme Court won't interfere with gay marriage in state
byline: By Dan Levine
8:31am EDT

sex weddings in the most populous U.S. state, dealing a blow to gay marriage opponents who are trying to regroup after losing at the nation's high court earlier this year.

California voters passed a gay marriage ban in 2008, known as Proposition 8, but a San Francisco federal judge struck down the initiative as unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that supporters of the ban did not have the legal right to appeal.

In the aftermath of that highly anticipated opinion, Prop 8 supporters asked the California Supreme Court to rule that the original federal order did not apply across the state, but rather only to the two couples involved in the case.

But the California Supreme Court denied that request in a one-sentence order on Wednesday, which did not provide any legal analysis.

Andy Pugno, an attorney for pro-Prop 8 group ProtectMarriage.com, said the court's ruling "leaves grave doubts about the future of the initiative process in our state."

Two days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June, a federal appeals court allowed gay marriages to resume in California and a wave of ceremonies began immediately.

Minnesota and Rhode Island began to allow gay weddings last month. Same-sex marriage is allowed in 15 states and Washington, D.C., and gay rights advocates believe momentum is on their side to extend it further.

The case in the California Supreme Court is Dennis Hollingsworth vs. Patrick O'Connell et al., S211990.



headline: Oklahoma governor seeks end to Native American adoption fight
byline: By Heide Brandes

old Native American girl caught in a protracted adoption custody battle, warning him to cooperate with the girl's adoptive parents or face charges for interfering.

After initially declining to sign an extradition warrant for biological father Dusten Brown to face felony charges in South Carolina, where the girl's adoptive parents live, Fallin warned Brown that if he did not meet the adoptive parents, Matt and Melanie Capobianco, in Oklahoma, she might force him to go to South Carolina.

"Mr. and Mrs. Capobianco deserve an opportunity to meet with their adopted daughter. They also deserve the chance to meet with Mr. Brown and put an end to this conflict," Fallin said on Wednesday. "If Mr. Brown is unwilling to cooperate with these reasonable expectations, then I will be forced to expedite his extradition request and let the issue be settled in court."

The case has highlighted overlapping parental claims in two states and the clash between a Native American culture seeking to protect children from being adopted outside their tribes and U.S. legal safeguards for adoptive parents.

Veronica's birth mother, who is not Native American, arranged the adoption with the Capobiancos before the girl was born. Veronica lived with them after her birth in 2009. Brown intervened in 2010 before the adoption process was final, and a South Carolina family court ordered that Veronica be turned over to Brown in December 2011.

Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation who was not married to the birth mother, argued that the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 allowed him to have Veronica, who is 3/256th Cherokee.

The law was intended to keep Native American children from being separated from their families.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the ruling, and the adoption was finalized in South Carolina in July.

But Brown refused to give up Veronica and was arrested on August 12 in Oklahoma on a charge of "custodial interference."

South Carolina is seeking his extradition.

Veronica is believed to be staying with Brown's relatives in Oklahoma.

The adoptive parents are in Oklahoma this week to try to visit Veronica and resolve the case. After the couple were denied the opportunity to see her, they called on Brown on Wednesday to meet with them and reach a compromise.

"I look forward to when we can restore our private life with Veronica," Melanie Capobianco said at a news conference Wednesday in Tulsa, Oklahoma. "We want to ensure a lifelong relationship with her Oklahoma family as well. We want to see a resolution for Veronica."

Cherokee Nation leaders said on Wednesday that Brown has the right to have his arguments heard in court hearings in Oklahoma and asked that he be allowed his "due process." Brown is scheduled for a hearing September 12 to contest his warrant.

"We will continue to stand by Dusten and his biological daughter, Veronica, and for what is right," said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker.

Troy Dunn, a lawyer who specializes in locating and reuniting birth families and adopted children, joined the Capobiancos in seeking a compromise.

"I think it may be possible to structure an arrangement to allow Veronica to be the most loved girl," Dunn said. "A resolution can be sculpted if Dusten is willing to participate."

hour standoff at a rural Louisiana bank, which left another hostage and the gunman dead.

A police SWAT team stormed the Tensas State Bank branch in St. Joseph, Louisiana, shortly after midnight, State Police spokesman Albert Paxton said.

He said the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Fuaed Abdo Ahmed, had been threatening to kill his hostages, and shot them when police entered the building. Police then shot and killed the gunman, Paxton said.

The town of fewer than 1,200 people is about 220 miles north of New Orleans.

"He was angry and he wanted to kill hostages," Paxton said. The gunman initially took three bank employees hostage but released one woman after several hours.

The hostages were rushed to hospital, and one later died, said State Police Sergeant Eric Cuenca. They were not identified.

The other hostage was in critical condition on Wednesday afternoon, said Charla Ducote, spokeswoman for Rapides Regional Medical Center in Alexandria, Louisiana.

Ahmed was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and had complained of hearing voices, police said. His family owns a convenience store, Trak Food Store, in the town.

Police said Ahmed had intended to take hostages from the beginning, adding they found a book on hostage negotiations at his apartment.

"This was not a bank robbery," State Police Colonel Mike Edmonson told reporters in a video posted on the website of The Monroe Louisiana News Star. "He actually had a book for negotiations ... and knew exactly how the negotiations would take place, the questions he would be asked."

Ahmed's Facebook page had meditative passages from ancient Chinese texts, and he cited connections to the University of Louisiana at Monroe and Louisiana State University, along with notes about a trip to Dubai in June.

Ahmed was the California-born son of Yemeni parents. Police said there was no indication of any link to recent threats of attacks on the United States originating from Yemen.

Earlier this month, the United States temporarily closed several of its embassies and consulates, including in Yemen, over security concerns.

"We don't have any reason to believe there was any connection," Paxton said.

Clyde Arnold, 64, who manages a grocery store near Tensas State Bank and Trak Food Store, said he was shocked by the incident.

"This is a very rural, quiet area, and nothing like this has ever happened here before," Arnold said. He said he had never met Ahmed or other members of the family.

Asked whether the two were burned alive, Hannah answered simply, "Yes." She also said she was not at the house when her mother was killed. When asked where she was when the "fire went off," she replied, "On the road to Idaho."

Hannah said she, her brother and mother had been lured to DiMaggio's home by a ruse: "He told us he was losing his house because of money issues, so we went up there one last time to support him ... but he tricked us."

headline: Prosecutors not allowed to see report on Fort Hood shooter
byline: By Eric M. Johnson and Lisa Maria Garza
8:31am EDT

A military judge on Wednesday blocked prosecutors from seeing a mental health report on the U.S. Army psychiatrist who admitted killing 13 soldiers in a 2009 shooting rampage at a Texas army base, even though he wanted to make the report public.

The report revealed that Major Nidal Hassan, 42, told mental health evaluators that he wanted to become a martyr as a result of his attack.

Hassan, acting as his own defense lawyer, had offered to share the confidential and potentially damaging report with prosecutors in his court-martial on 13 charges of premeditated murder and 32 charges of premeditated attempted murder.

"It's clear to the court that the accused has waived his privilege (right to keep the report confidential)," Judge Colonel Tara Osborn said. "I'm going to treat it as if it had not been waived."

Standby defense lawyers assigned to assist Hasan have said they believe he is actively seeking the death penalty. In the medical report in question, Hasan told a panel of evaluators he had hoped to die while carrying out "jihad" because it would signal God had designated him as a religious martyr.

Hasan has already told the jury "I am the shooter," saying he "switched sides" in what he considered a U.S. war on Islam.

By denying prosecutors the full, 49-page sanity report, also known as a 706 form, the judge likely also kept it from being seen by the jury.

"You can't find a more confidential document in the entire case file than the 706 long form," said James Culp, a prominent defense lawyer for defendants in the military justice system.

Hasan authorized civilian lawyer John Galligan to leak the report to The New York Times, which published the images of three pages of the report online on Tuesday.

Osborn instructed prosecutors to avoid reading any media reports containing the leaked excerpts.

She also reaffirmed a previous ruling that standby attorneys must continue to aid Hasan with his defense. The standby lawyers had requested to reduce their role because they believed he was seeking the death penalty.

Hasan opened fire on fellow soldiers in a Fort Hood medical facility on November 5, 2009, eventually being shot by military police. Paralyzed from the waist down, he attends court in a wheelchair and rarely cross-examines witnesses.

"I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life," Hasan told the panel of military mental health experts. "However, if I died by lethal injection I would still be a martyr."



headline: Woman charged in attack on California singer who dedicated song to Trayvon Martin

Prosecutors in suburban San Francisco charged a white woman on Wednesday with assaulting a black musician after he dedicated a song to slain teenager Trayvon Martin on the same day a jury reached a verdict in the racially charged case, court documents showed.

Lester Chambers, 73, the former lead singer for the Chambers Brothers, had urged the district attorney for Alameda County to charge Dinalynn Andrews-Potter, 43, with a hate crime for shoving him down while he was performing a peace-seeking spiritual at a blues festival on July 13.

The disturbance, captured on video, happened the same day a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager in a verdict that spurred nationwide protests.

Video of the performance shows Chambers singing into the microphone with a band backing him up when a woman rushed to the stage, jumped up and shoved him so forcefully that he fell backward into sound equipment.

The Alameda County district attorney found no evidence of racial animus and charged Andrews-Potter, who retired from the U.S. Navy and says she suffers post-traumatic stress, with felony assault and elder abuse in connection with the incident in the San Francisco suburb of Hayward, court documents showed.

Police arrested Andrews-Potter right after the incident and subsequently released her, and a warrant was issued for her arrest on Wednesday. It was not immediately known if she had retained a lawyer in the case and attempts to reach her for comment were unsuccessful.

"I certainly wanted her charged for an assault and hate crime because that's what it was," Chambers told Reuters in a telephone interview from his northern California home.

"She got right up into my face on stage with a microphone in my hand asking God to change this violent world we live in from hate to love," he said.

Chambers, best known for the hit song "Time Has Come Today," said the shoving left him so battered and bruised he was unable to walk off the outdoor stage. Paramedics put him on a stretcher and transported him to a hospital.

headline: Manning tells court he's 'sorry' for U.S. secrets breach to WikiLeaks
byline: By Ian Simpson
8:31am EDT

U.S. soldier Bradley Manning on Wednesday told a military court "I'm sorry" for giving war logs and diplomatic secrets to the WikiLeaks website three years ago, the biggest breach of classified data in the nation's history.

"I am sorry that my actions hurt people. I'm sorry that they hurt the United States," the 25-year-old U.S. Army Private First Class told the sentencing phase of his court-martial. "I am sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions ... The last few years have been a learning experience."

Manning spoke quietly and non-defiantly in his first extensive public comments since February.

Manning faces up to 90 years in prison for providing more than 700,000 documents, battle videos and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, hurling the pro-transparency website and its founder, Julian Assange, into the world spotlight.

Defense lawyers seeking a milder sentence rested their case on Wednesday after Manning's statement. With about a dozen witnesses including Army superiors, mental health professionals and Manning's own sister, they sought to show Judge Colonel Denise Lind that commanders ignored signs of mental stress.

An Army psychologist testified at the hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, that Manning, who is gay, felt isolated because he was wrestling with his gender identity. Another mental health specialist testified that Manning had hoped to end war.

"I should have worked more aggressively inside the system ... Unfortunately, I can't go back and change things," Manning, wearing his dress uniform and glasses, his hair in a crew cut, said from the witness stand.

He did not appear to be reading from notes and looked at the judge and around the room as he spoke.

"I understand I must pay a price for my decisions," Manning continued in his first lengthy public statement since February. "I want to be a better person, to go to college, to get a degree and to have a meaningful relationship with my sister and her family."

Manning was convicted of 20 charges, including espionage and theft, on July 30. He was found not guilty of the most serious count, aiding the enemy, which carried a life sentence.

A military spokesman said the judge would most likely sentence Manning next week at the earliest.

Prosecutors, who have argued that Manning was an arrogant soldier who aided al Qaeda militants and harmed the United States with the release of the documents, will have an opportunity to rebut the defense case on Friday.

'HYPER-MASCULINE ENVIRONMENT'

Captain Michael Worsley, who treated Manning from December 2009 to May 2010 during his deployment in Iraq, testified that the stress Manning had felt from his job as a low-level intelligence analyst was compounded by being in a "hyper masculine environment" of a combat zone.

"Being in the military and having a gender identity issue does not exactly go hand in hand," Worsley said. "You put him in that kind of environment, this hyper masculine environment ... with no coping skills, the pressure would have been incredible."

That pressure reached a peak when Manning punched another soldier, Worsley said. He said he had met infrequently with Manning and had no input from his superiors until the punching incident.

Navy Reserve Captain David Moulton, a forensic psychiatrist, said he had diagnosed Manning as having gender dysphoria, or wanting to be the opposite sex, as well as narcissism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. Those problems were compounded by the unraveling of a romantic relationship, the stress of serving in a Baghdad combat base and post-adolescent idealism, he said.

"Manning was under the impression that the information he was giving was going to change the way the world saw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and future wars, actually," said Moulton, who interviewed Manning for about 21 hours and spent more than 100 hours on the case.

'NO WAR WAS WORTH IT'

The psychiatrist said Manning thought it "would lead to a greater good. Society as a whole would come to the conclusion that the war wasn't worth it, that no war was worth it."

Manning's sister, Casey Major, 36, of Oklahoma City, testified about how her parents' alcoholism and infighting compelled her to play a lead role in raising her brother.

She recounted their early days together in Crescent, Oklahoma, reviewed family photos, and said, "I just hope he can be who he wants to be. I just hope he can be happy."

Troubles at home prompted a teenaged Manning to move to Potomac, Maryland, to live with his aunt, said Debra van Alstyne, the aunt who took him in. She recalled that Manning had joined the Army in the hope of going to college on the GI bill, after having difficulty balancing classes and a job at Starbucks.

The material Manning released that shocked many around the world was a 2007 gunsight video of a U.S. Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Baghdad. A dozen people were killed, including two Reuters news staff. WikiLeaks dubbed the footage "Collateral Murder."

Manning, described by his superiors as an Internet expert, faces the prospect of decades of monotonous prison life - with no online access - once he is sentenced.



headline: Ex-U.S. congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. sentenced to 30 months in prison
byline: By Lacey Johnson
8:31am EDT

1/2 years in prison for misuse of campaign funds.

Jackson, a former Democratic representative and the son of civil rights leader the Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr., apologized before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced him on Wednesday.

Jackson, 48, had pleaded guilty in February to misusing about $750,000 in campaign funds on luxuries such as fur capes, celebrity memorabilia, mounted elk heads and a Rolex watch.

"I misled the American people," Jackson said at the hearing. "I also want to apologize to my dad and my mother," Jackson said, wiping away tears. "I take responsibility for my actions and I'm very sorry for what I have done," he said.

His wife, Sandi, a former Chicago city council member, was sentenced to one year for falsifying tax returns that failed to report the campaign money as income. The couple has two children.

The judge ordered Jackson Jr. to report to prison on or after November 1 and for Sandi Jackson to report to prison 30 days after he is released to reduce the impact on the children.

"I stand before you today asking for mercy," Sandi Jackson said, adding that "my heart breaks every day with the pain it has caused my babies."

Jackson Jr. asked on Monday that the judge recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that he serve his time at a federal prison in Montgomery, Alabama, because it would allow him to be nearer to his wife and children who live in Washington D.C. The judge said Wednesday she would make that recommendation.

Jackson Jr. served in Congress from 1995 until he resigned after re-election last year, citing health reasons.

He disappeared from public view in the summer of 2012 and speculation swirled for weeks about his condition. At first Jackson Jr. said he was being treated for exhaustion, and his doctor said in July 2012 said he was being treated for a "mood disorder."

He eventually was treated for at least six weeks at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for bipolar disorder.

Jackson Jr. also was sentenced to three years supervised release and ordered to perform 500 hours of community service. Sandi Jackson was given 12 months supervised release and 200 hours of community service.

Prosecutors had recommended a sentence of four years for the ex-congressman and 18 months for Sandi Jackson.

U.S. prosecutors asked in June that two of the Jacksons' houses, in Washington and Chicago, be subject to forfeiture, along with a bank account holding $80,000, as part of a $750,000 judgment.

Prosecutors asked in a filing this month that the forfeiture motion be delayed until October 25 since Jackson has said he is trying to pay off the judgment.

'HALL OF SHAME' CONTENDER?

The Reverend Jackson told reporters afterward that it has been an "extraordinarily difficult" time for the family.

"Jesse's been very sick," Reverend Jackson said. "This time a year ago, I really thought we may have lost him. I think he's strong enough now to accept the challenges put before him by the judge."

Dozens of letters to the judge were filed in the court docket before the sentencing. They included ones from Jackson Sr., ordinary people who had met the congressman only once and Democratic Representative Marica Fudge, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, asking for clemency.

Most letter writers expressed outrage at the couple's behavior and asked for the maximum punishment as a way to combat persistent corruption in Illinois and in Chicago's Cook County.

"Cook County is likely the most corrupt county in the most corrupt state and the self-serving greed displayed by Mr. Jackson over several years in office qualifies him for the Illinois Hall of Shame," Cook County resident Kenneth Kunka wrote.

headline: San Diego mayor unwelcome in Hooters restaurants
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

For San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, who faces a torrent of sexual harassment allegations, the message is that his alleged behavior is too boorish even for Hooters restaurants, best known for their scantily clad waitresses and the patrons who ogle them.

Four San Diego-area Hooters restaurants have posted signs saying the 70-year-old Democrat and former congressman "will not be served in this establishment. We believe women should be treated with respect."

"It is localized to our four San Diego locations," Melissa Fry, marketing director for Hootwinc LLC, the West Coast headquarters for the Atlanta-based restaurant chain, said on Wednesday.

More than a dozen women have publicly accused Filner since last month of groping and making other unwanted advances toward them over the years, starting with a former press secretary who filed a sexual harassment suit against the mayor and the city.

The signs are actually the creation of conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck, who began offering them last week as an Internet download from his website.

Beck has cited the Filner scandal as one of several high-profile cases of sexual misconduct by Democrats, including former congressman and New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, in contesting the assertion by some Democrats that the Republican Party is waging a "war on women."

"I made the sign for the people of San Diego, all businesses in San Diego," he told radio listeners.

A Hooters spokeswoman, Kelly Propst, said the four San Diego outlets "took it upon themselves" to post the signs starting on Monday. Customers starting noticing the signs and tweeting pictures of them on Tuesday.

"Our Hooters girls in San Diego have spoken. Not a corporate gig, but we support our girls," the company said in a message posted via Twitter on Tuesday night.

The irony of the Filner snub was self-evident coming from a restaurant chain that promotes a waitressing staff of "beautiful Hooters girls" who dress in cleavage-revealing tops and short shorts.

Beck took a moment out of his radio show and webstream on Wednesday to savor the spectacle, displaying a photo of two Hooters servers in their skimpy outfits holding one of his signs.

"At the top of the show, I told you California is creating a new society without any common sense, but at the least the girls of Hooters are standing up against the mayor of San Diego," he said. "This is a sweet moment."

Neither the mayor's office nor his lawyers were immediately available for comment.

Nearly every elected official of both parties in San Diego has called on Filner to resign as mayor of California's second-largest city, and a bipartisan campaign seeking his ouster through a recall election has been launched.

Filner announced July 26 that he was taking a break from office to undergo two weeks of intensive behavioral counseling to deal with what he called a pattern of disrespectful and "intimidating" treatment of women."

His lawyers have said that Filner was completing his therapy on Saturday - about 10 days earlier than originally planned - but would continue counseling on an out-patient basis while remaining on personal leave for another week.

In his first public statement since taking leave, a rebuttal filed on Monday in answer to the recall petition, Filner refused again to step down and defended his accomplishments as mayor.

On Tuesday, his chief of staff acknowledged the mayor had been weakened by the scandal but would press forward with an agenda that members of City Council would hopefully support.



headline: U.S. political writer Jack Germond dies at age 85
byline: By Bill Trott
8:31am EDT

Jack Germond, the gruff and rumpled "fat man" of American political journalism best known for his coverage of presidential campaigns, died on Wednesday at the age of 85.

He died "peacefully and quickly" early in the morning at his home in West Virginia after recently finishing a novel, his wife, Alice, said in an email sent to friends and journalists.

As a reporter and columnist for Gannett Newspapers, the Washington Star and the Baltimore Sun and a commentator on television shows like "The McLaughlin Group," Germond was on the top rung of political journalists.

"He had a bold journalistic ethic, and that matters. He was fortunate to spend his life working at a job he would have done for free during some halcyon times in the newspaper business," his wife wrote.

Germond was among a group of young reporters who decided to take a more behind-the-scenes look at politics in the wake of the 1960 presidential race, spurred in part by Theodore White's book, "Making of the President, 1960."

The Boston-born Germond, who covered the campaign in 1960, and his colleagues were eager to get to know the candidates but also worked to find out what was going on behind the marbled edifices of the nation's capital.

"The joy of covering politics ... is the joy of knowing America and of telling the readers how things work, to the extent you can find out," Germond wrote in his autobiography, "Fat Man in a Middle Seat."

A balding, rotund man with a gravelly voice and a taste for Scotch and the racetrack, Germond was seen by his colleagues as the epitome of a hard-nosed journalist.

He covered politics first for Gannett in Rochester and Albany, New York, and then in Washington beginning in 1961. He later served as Gannett's Washington bureau chief for four years before leaving for the Washington Star in 1973.

There, beginning in 1977, he teamed up with Jules Witcover, a former Washington Post reporter, to form one of the most respected writing duos in American journalism.

When the Star folded in 1981, they went to the Baltimore Sun where they continued their column until Germond retired at the end of 2000. Germond and Alice, his second wife, moved to West Virginia, and he still wrote occasionally for the dailybeast.com and other outlets.

Germond and Witcover also wrote a series of books together, including one on each presidential race from 1980 through 1992.

Germond died having just finished writing a political novel that he had been pondering for years, his wife said.

TOO MUCH TV SHOUTING

Germond appeared for 15 years on "The McLaughlin Group" television show as the most liberal member of a team that presented different views of Washington issues. He quit when he decided the show had become too much of a shouting match and not enough of an exchange of ideas.

He also worked as an analyst on CNN and a panelist on Washington Week in Review.

Germond called himself a "leading advocate and practitioner of what the political scientists disparage as racehorse journalism, which means putting the emphasis on winners and losers rather than the issues."

By the 2000 presidential campaign, he had become disenchanted with what he saw as the programmed and poll-driven nature of the races. "Politics have gotten nastier as well as duller," Germond said.

While his writings and commentary were staples of Washington journalism, Germond said his looks and mannerisms sometimes worked against him.

He said he once did not get a job because the executives saw "a fat bald guy who looked unkempt even in a freshly pressed suit and a Brooks Brothers shirt, who played poker and the horses rather than golf, who didn't give dinner parties except for friends, and who sometimes drank too much. I was ... a cultural misfit."

But his peers saw him as a man who knew his stuff and gave good advice.

"He's got unbelievable judgment about people and politics," Paul West, the Sun's Washington bureau chief, said at the time of Germond's retirement. "He's been a father-confessor to generations of reporters."



headline: U.S. military judge won't dismiss prosecutors in Afghan rampage case
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

A military judge in the case of a U.S. soldier who pleaded guilty to slaughtering 16 Afghan civilians declined to dismiss the prosecution team on Wednesday, despite defense complaints that keeping the team on could prejudice proceedings, the defense team said.

Attorneys for Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales complained that his constitutional right not to incriminate himself was violated when the judge mistakenly provided prosecutors with an unredacted copy of a mental health evaluation. They sought to have the prosecutors disqualified over the incident.

But defense lawyers received word on Wednesday that the judge, Army Colonel Jeffery Nance, had denied the request, according to Kathy Martens, a paralegal for Bales's civilian defense attorney John Henry Browne.

An Army spokesman declined to confirm the report, and Browne declined to comment on the ruling. Browne had previously said that a decision to keep the prosecution team "would be a huge issue on appeal."

Bales, in a deal that spares him the death penalty, pleaded guilty in June to walking off his base in Afghanistan's Kandahar province before dawn on March 11, 2012, and gunning down civilians in their homes in at least two villages.

He will still face a sentencing hearing next week that will determine whether he will ever have a shot at parole or spend the rest of his life in prison. His lawyers had argued that the fairness of that proceeding had been compromised.

Prosecutors argued during the hearing that seeing a document was not equivalent to using it against a defendant, and that the error should not result in disqualification.

Bales, a decorated veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, acknowledged the killings upon pleading guilty in June and told the court there was "not a good reason in this world" for his actions.

His attack marked the worst case of civilian slaughter blamed on a lone, rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War, and further strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.

Defense attorneys have argued that Bales, a father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his deployment to Afghanistan.



headline: Judge rules doctor to be tried for alleged Omaha revenge killings
byline: By Katie Schubert
8:31am EDT

An Omaha judge ruled on Wednesday that there was enough evidence to allow a doctor to stand trial for four murders that police say were acts of revenge over his firing from a residency program in 2001.

Dr. Anthony J. Garcia, 40, is charged with four counts of first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of Dr. Roger Brumback and his wife, Mary, in May, as well as the 2008 killings of 11-year-old Thomas Hunter and his family's housekeeper, Shirlee Sherman, in 2008.

During a preliminary hearing on Wednesday, Omaha Police Officer Derek Mois testified before Douglas County District Court Judge Darryl Lowe about the crime scenes and the evidence investigators say links Garcia to Omaha at the times of the killings.

Mois testified the stab wounds on all four victims had a similar pattern. Roger Brumback died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen and also was stabbed.

Garcia, who remains in custody, was arrested July 15 in southern Illinois by the Illinois State Police and FBI agents from the Omaha office.

Police say the killings were acts of revenge against Brumback and another Creighton University doctor, Dr. William Hunter, who fired him from a pathology residency in 2001 for unprofessional conduct. Thomas Hunter was William Hunter's son.

An affidavit unsealed last month showed receipts, eyewitness accounts, cell phone records, and evidence at the Brumbacks' home connected Garcia to Omaha at the times of the killings.

According to the affidavit and records, Garcia applied for an Indiana medical license in 2008 and in 2012. Indiana denied his requests. Records released by the Indiana medical board from those applications show he failed to complete residencies in New York, Illinois and Louisiana in addition to Nebraska.

He was suspended from a New York residency for yelling at a radiology technician, then withdrew from the program in 1999. He also withdrew from an Illinois residency, citing migraine headaches.



headline: Uniforms seen as bright spot in drab back-to-school season
byline: By Dhanya Skariachan
8:31am EDT

When Robyn Asbell started kindergarten this month in Covington, Georgia, she had to wear a white collared shirt and a khaki jumper instead of her favorite pink sequin dress.

Asbell is among a growing number of U.S. school children who are required to wear a uniform. The trend is expected to gain steam as public school enrollment continues to set new records.

That has boosted prospects for uniform sales in the United States and made the category one of the few bright spots this back-to-school season when the National Retail Federation expects overall spending to fall 8 percent.

Uniforms were once required mostly by U.S. private and parochial schools. More public schools have begun to require them. Many school principals are advocating a uniform policy citing its positive impact on issues like peer pressure, classroom discipline, student safety and bullying.

"It kind of evens everybody out," said Asbell's mom Susan Jacobs.

Almost half of U.S. public schools now have a formal dress code or uniforms compared with 21 percent in 2000, according to a survey by Lands' End and the National Association of Elementary School Principals. At the same time, more private schools are requiring uniforms with their logos, said John Maher, senior vice president at Lands' End Outfitters.

Though still just a tiny piece of the close to $27 billion dollar back-to-school market, retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, Lands' End, Old Navy and Staples are eager to compete for uniform sales and the additional traffic they bring to stores and websites during the second biggest selling season of the year.

"All our retailers are projecting increases for this year," said Michael Arking, president of FrenchToast.com, which has more than 10 percent of the U.S. uniform market. He expects sales to rise 10 percent this year. He said about 100,000 students will wear uniforms for the first time this fall.

In the 2013-2014 school year, over 100 public school districts, representing 650,000 students, are considering or implementing a school uniform policy, a 25 percent increase over 2012, according to an annual school survey by French Toast and research firm Morley.

Over the years, the definition of uniforms has changed.

"Essentially it's not so much you know plaids and ties and sports jackets. It is a lot more casual polos and khakis and basics," Arking said.

French Toast, owned by the LT Apparel Group, expects to double its share of the highly fragmented $930 million U.S. uniform market in five years. Other prominent U.S. uniform suppliers include Elder Manufacturing Co, School Apparel, Dennis Uniform, Rifle/Kaynee, Flynn &amp; O'Hara Uniforms and Young Fashions School Uniforms. They are all privately held.

LOOKING TO IMPRESS

Sensing their opportunity, retailers are stepping up competition in the uniform aisles and online.

Walmart has set up "uniform shops" or temporary boutiques within some stores rather than just displaying uniforms in the apparel section. It has added uniforms this year to "Classrooms by Walmart," an online tool for parents and teachers to access school supply lists from thousands of schools.

Target, which carries uniforms in 800 of its 1,700 stores, said uniform sales so far are "strong." It is seeing a "particular uptick" in online sales. Target has for the first time "created a uniform destination" in about half of its stores that carry them, spokesman Joshua Thomas said, adding it was too early to comment on the sales impact from the initiative.

Lands' End said its "single largest day" of uniform sales ever in July this year.

"Our back-to-school business has started extremely strong," said Edgar Huber, CEO of Lands' End, a unit of Sears. While about 1.5 million students currently wear Lands' End uniforms, he sees it rising to 5 million over two years.

Even stores that have not sold uniforms before are jumping on the bandwagon. Staples, known more for paper and printers, is carrying uniforms for the first time ever, albeit online.

"As we're seeing more and more public schools going to a uniforms model, this category is a natural choice for Staples for back to school, as we provide a one stop shopping experience," said Christine Mallon, vice president of marketing strategy and customer segments at Staples.



headline: One hostage still hospitalized after deadly Louisiana bank standoff

hour standoff at a rural Louisiana bank that ended when police stormed in, killing the gunman.

The other hostage shot by the gunman died following the incident, which stretched from Tuesday into early Wednesday at a bank in St. Joseph, Louisiana, a town of fewer than 1,200 people about 220 miles north of New Orleans, said State Police Sergeant Eric Cuenca.

A U.S. police SWAT team stormed Tensas State Bank shortly after midnight, killing the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Fuaed Abdo Ahmed, said State Police spokesman Albert Paxton.

The gunman had been threatening to kill one or both of his hostages, and shot them when police entered the building. Police then shot and killed him, Paxton said.

"He was angry and he wanted to kill hostages," Paxton said of the gunman, who initially took three bank employees hostage but released one woman after several hours.

The two wounded hostages were rushed to local hospitals but one of them later died, said State Police Sergeant Eric Cuenca.

The other, who was listed in critical condition, remained hospitalized on Wednesday, said Charla Ducote, spokeswoman for Rapides Regional Medical Center in Alexandria, Louisiana.

Ducote declined further comment.

The names of the hostages were not immediately released.

Ahmed was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and had complained of hearing voices, police said. The gunman's family owned a convenience store in the town.

He had intended to take hostages from the beginning, police said. They found a book on hostage negotiations at his apartment.

"This was not a bank robbery," State Police Colonel Mike Edmonson told reporters in a video posted on the website of the Monroe, Louisiana News Star newspaper. "He actually had a book for negotiations... and knew exactly how the negotiations would take place, the questions he would be asked."

Ahmed was the California-born son of Yemeni parents. Police said there was no indication of any link to recent threats of attacks on the United States originating from Yemen.

"We don't have any reason to believe there was any connection," Paxton said.

The United States earlier this month temporarily shut about 20 of its embassies and consulates in the Middle East and Africa, including its embassy in Yemen, and U.S. nationals were told to leave that country after U.S. officials said they picked up information about unspecified terrorist threats.

On his Facebook page, Ahmed repeatedly quotes passages from ancient Chinese texts known for their peaceful, meditative content. He also cites connections to University of Louisiana at Monroe and Louisiana State University, and notes taking a trip to Dubai in June.



headline: U.S. schools face tough decisions on Obamacare benefits
byline: By Yasmeen Abutaleb
8:31am EDT

Hit by years of budget cuts, some U.S. public school boards are looking to avoid providing health benefits to substitute teachers and supporting staff under President Barack Obama's reform law, education officials say.

According to the law, employers will have to offer health coverage to all full-time employees, defined as those who work an average of 30 or more hours per week each month, or else pay a fine starting in 2015.

School boards, already struggling to manage after years of state budget cuts, are trying to get ahead of the potential costs of Obamacare for the current academic year, education and labor officials say. The need to find creative solutions, or risk cutting back staff hours further, will increase as they finalize their budgets, they say.

In Pennsylvania's Penn Manor School District, Superintendent Mike Leichliter said there is no room in its constrained budget to provide additional employee insurance. Instead of cutting hours, the district used a substitute-teacher contracting service to pay part of the salaries for 95 employees. Money for such a service does not count against the school's budget.

"When we looked at our costs, (healthcare) was one area that really had the potential to skyrocket," Leichliter said. "This is absolutely the worst time for school districts to be faced with mandated increases."

The National School Board Association said many states and school districts have at least explored reducing hours, according to Linda Embrey, a communications officer. Several school officials contacted by Reuters said they could not find a way around cuts.

In Indiana's Fort Wayne Community Schools district, one of the state's largest, administrators reduced hours for 610 of its 4,050 employees, including substitute teachers and support staff, who were working 30 or more hours a week. Providing them with health insurance would have cost $10 million annually, said Krista Stockman, public information officer for Fort Wayne.

"You get to a point where there's a danger that you're cutting too much and that the quality of education you're providing isn't as great," Stockman said. "We're just going to have to do the same amount or more with less."

Most of the employees affected are substitute teachers, classroom aides, cafeteria workers, bus drivers or similar support staff, according to school officials and labor representatives. They had not been receiving healthcare coverage from their employers in the past. Now, instead of getting such employer-sponsored benefits under the reform law, they may be eligible for government-subsidized coverage that will be offered by new state insurance exchanges starting on October 1.

SEQUESTER TAKES A SECOND TOLL

During the 2012-2013 school year, 26 states provided less money to local school districts than the prior year, and 35 states provided less funding than in 2008 (a better year), according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

This year they are also grappling with across-the-board "sequester" spending cuts introduced after Congress deadlocked over how to fix the deficit. An Obama administration official said those cuts plus the states', and not healthcare reform, are the main reasons for staff losing work-time at schools.

"We are seeing no systematic evidence that the Affordable Care Act is leading to a shift to part-time work," the official said. "There are a variety of factors impacting schools, including sequestration, which is cutting budgets and is a completely separate issue."

The National Education Association is working with union leaders across the country to figure out how to encourage employers to avoid cutting hours as a result of healthcare reform, said Joel Solomon, NEA senior policy analyst. The effort has included a training session for dozens of labor representatives in June, and more sessions are planned for this year.

Solomon said one popular solution offered by the NEA is to help schools get a more precise accounting of employee hours to see whether staff are truly working an average of 30 hours a week each month when holidays and other time off are included. That has helped some schools make less drastic cuts in employee hours, he said.

Many school employees are expected to qualify for Obamacare's tax subsidies, which are available starting in January to people who make within 400 percent of the federal poverty level ($45,960 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of four in 2013).

Even if they don't, the new plans are preferable to what they currently have to buy on the individual market because insurers cannot deny coverage based on prior illness.

In Nebraska, the Plattsmouth Community School District is limiting the hours of permanent substitute teachers, who typically work every day, said Marlene Wehrbein, a labor union official who advocates for employees in the state's public school districts.

"It creates a lot of inconsistency in staffing, and I can't see how that would be good for students," Wehrbein said. "How could you have a teacher teaching English four days a week and then on the fifth day you have someone else?"

8:31am EDT

Lawyers for a U.S. soldier who pleaded guilty in June to the slaughter of 16 Afghan civilians sought the dismissal of the prosecution team at a hearing on Tuesday, saying a document they saw could compromise the fairness of the upcoming sentencing proceeding.

Attorneys for Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales complained that his constitutional right not to incriminate himself was violated when the judge in the case mistakenly provided prosecutors with an unredacted copy of a court-ordered mental health evaluation.

Bales, in a deal that spares him the death penalty, pleaded guilty in June to walking off his base in Afghanistan's Kandahar province before dawn on March 11, 2012, and gunning down civilians in their homes in at least two villages.

But he will still face a sentencing hearing next week that will determine whether he will ever have a shot at parole or spend the rest of his life in prison, and his lawyers argued that the fairness of that proceeding had been compromised.

"He was compelled and ordered to talk to the sanity board over our objection and he was promised it would never be used for any reason," said John Henry Browne, Bales' civilian attorney, speaking to reporters after the hearing. "It's actually really pretty simple."

Prosecutors argued during the hearing that seeing a document was not equivalent to using it against a defendant, and that the error should not result in disqualification.

"The Constitution prohibits the use of (compelled) statements," said Captain Chad Fisher, who was not among the prosecutors who reviewed the offending document. "It does not prohibit exposure."

The military judge in the case, Army Colonel Jeffery Nance, promised to rule quickly on whether to replace the prosecution team. Such a move would likely delay the sentencing hearing, which is expected to last for seven to 10 days, Browne said.

Bales, a decorated veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, acknowledged the killings upon pleading guilty in June and told the court there was "not a good reason in this world" for his actions.

His attack marked the worst case of civilian slaughter blamed on a lone, rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War, and further strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.

girl ring, may face charges after 392 pot plants were found at her Nevada desert home, a county sheriff said on Tuesday.

Deputies who went to Fleiss' home in Pahrump, some 45 miles west of Las Vegas, last week searching for a wanted female found the marijuana plants, Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said.

Fleiss, 47, told detectives she was growing cannabis so she could sell it to a Las Vegas cooperative, but admitted that she did not have a license to do so, according to a news release issued by the Nye County Sheriff's Office.

Also found at her home were grow lights and several bottles of chemicals used to cultivate marijuana, the sheriff's office said. The plants were collected as evidence and the equipment destroyed.

Fleiss was not arrested because she was caring for exotic birds worth $200,000 and because she was cooperative throughout the investigation, De Meo said, but his office had turned the case over to prosecutors for potential filing of marijuana possession charges.

A spokeswoman for the Nye County District Attorney's Office said no charges had been filed against Fleiss as of Tuesday afternoon.

The sheriff's office did not identify the person they were seeking at Fleiss' home at the time of the search but said they had gone there looking for her before.

Fleiss, the daughter of a prominent Los Angeles doctor, became a media sensation following her 1993 arrest in Los Angeles on suspicion of running a prostitution business that catered to Hollywood celebrities and the wealthy.

After two trials that made worldwide headlines, she was ultimately convicted on federal tax evasion charges in connection with the prostitution ring and served nearly two years in prison.

Fleiss never revealed the names of her clients, but actor Charlie Sheen acknowledged in videotaped trial testimony that he paid thousands of dollars for the services of her prostitutes.

In 2008, Fleiss was the subject of a documentary chronicling her attempts to set up a legal brothel near Pahrump catering to women which also featured her menagerie of exotic birds.



headline: California man behind anti-Islam film released to halfway house
byline: By Steve Gorman

U.S. protests across the Muslim world has been moved from prison to a halfway house to serve the remaining weeks of his sentence for probation violations stemming from his role in making the video, federal officials said on Tuesday.

The 56-year-old Egyptian-born Coptic Christian, whose real name is Mark Basseley Youssef, previously served time for a 2010 bank fraud conviction and was sent back to prison last year after admitting to breaching the terms of his probation.

"I never thought my movie can cause anyone trouble or anyone can get killed from my movie," he told CNN in a telephone interview aired on Tuesday, his first public comments since his arrest in the wake of unrest stirred by the film.

The crudely made 13-minute video he produced in Southern California, circulated online under several titles, including "The Innocence of Muslims," portrayed the Prophet Mohammad as a fool and sexual deviant.

American cast members later said they were misled into appearing in a film they believed was supposed to be an adventure drama called "Desert Warrior."

The film touched off a torrent of anti-American demonstrations in Arab and Muslim countries, where many consider any depiction of the prophet as blasphemous.

The start of the unrest on September 11, 2012, coincided with an attack on U.S. diplomatic posts in the Libyan city of Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens.

But links between the Benghazi assault and "The Innocence of Muslims" have since been debunked.

Susan Rice, then-U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, initially said the Benghazi attack grew from a spontaneous protest over the film. But the Obama administration later acknowledged that militants tied to al Qaeda had planned and carried out the attack and that there was no demonstration in Benghazi at the time.

Youssef was transferred from a federal detention center during the past few weeks to an undisclosed halfway house as part of preparation for his release, Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesman Ed Ross said.

He is due to be freed on September 26 but will remain under the supervision of probation officials for the next four years, Ross said.

headline: DNA tests fail to link 'In Cold Blood' killers to Florida murders

8:31am EDT

DNA tests failed to prove a suspected link between the 1959 murders of a Kansas family portrayed in the book "In Cold Blood" and a quadruple homicide in Florida later the same year, authorities said on Tuesday.

However, the inconclusive testing was based on poor DNA samples that had undergone years of storage and handling.

Richard Hickock and Perry Smith were executed in 1965 for the murders of the Clutter family in Kansas and remain "the most viable suspects" in the Florida murders, they said.

Investigators exhumed the bodies of Hickock and Smith in December to obtain DNA samples to compare against evidence in the Florida murders.

Investigators never solved the murders of Cliff and Christine Walker and their two children in Osprey, Florida. The Florida murders took place about a month after the November 15, 1959 shotgun killings of Herbert and Bonnie Clutter and two of their children near Holcomb, Kansas.

The murders of the Clutters were reported in detail in Truman Capote's best-selling book "In Cold Blood," which later became a movie.

Hickock and Smith fled to Florida after the Clutter murders and were in the Osprey area at the time of the Walker killings, Sarasota County detectives have said.

Both sets of slayings involved a couple and their two children.

"Based on the totality of the evidence, investigators still regard Smith and Hancock as the most viable suspects in the Walker murders. However, DNA testing seems unlikely to provide conclusive evidence one way or the other," the statement said.

Hickock and Perry passed lie detector tests when questioned about the Walker murders. After their capture in Las Vegas. Smith had a knife identical to one stolen from Cliff Walker, case evidence showed.

A Detroit metropolitan county is threatening to cut funding to the city's art museum if Detroit's bankruptcy filing leads to the sale of any of its collection which includes works by Vincent van Gogh, Rembrandt and Diego Rivera.

The Oakland County Art Institute Authority will vote next Tuesday on whether to stop distributing property tax revenue to the Detroit Institute of Art (DIA) if Detroit's emergency manager decides to sell any of its artwork or divert funds from the museum to pay the city's creditors.

Last year, voters in suburban Oakland, Wayne and Macomb counties approved a property tax levy to provide the DIA up to $23 million annually for its operations. Oakland County taxpayers were expected to provide $9.8 million of the total.

The authority is taking the vote to put the city "on notice," said chairman Thomas Guastello. He said Detroit would be violating the counties' agreement with the DIA if it moved to monetize any DIA assets to pay the city's debt after it filed for the largest ever municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.

"This violates the core of the issue that was brought to the voters," he said.

Macomb and Wayne County, where Detroit is located, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The DIA has one of the top six art collections in the United States, according to the museum's website. It is known for a self portrait by Vincent Van and vast murals by Mexican artist Diego Rivera depicting "Detroit Industry."

Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder have repeatedly said that they do not want to sell any of the museum's collection. Orr told Reuters last week that he's not ruled out any options for ways to monetize the collection.

Orr's spokesman Bill Nowling said the city does not plan to sell the DIA art but is open to alternative plans that may raise money for the city. Christie's, the auction house Orr hired to estimate a value for the collection, may provide options to a sale, Nowling said.

"Christie's wants to come to the table with alternatives that generate revenue, substantial revenue, without changing the ownership of the art," Nowling said. "They didn't just want to come and value the art. They wanted to come and find a solution that would preserve the art.

The museum and Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette have contended that the art cannot be sold because it is held in a charitable trust for the people of Michigan.

headline: Wildfire destroys dozens of buildings in Idaho

A wildfire raging unchecked in the Idaho mountains has destroyed 71 structures, including at least a dozen homes, and was menacing two resort towns where nearly 1,000 summertime residents were evacuated this week, authorities said on Wednesday.

Much of the destruction wreaked by the blaze, burning in the steep, rugged forests of south central Idaho, was in a housing development near the town of Pine that is home to 53 of the structures lost, said fire information officer David Eaker.

The fire, whose menace is compounded by mountainous terrain, low humidity and thick smoke, is the latest to cause substantial property losses during a U.S. summer fire season that experts predict could become one of the worst on record.

Fire crews labored on Wednesday to protect houses in the threatened communities of Pine and Featherville by clearing brush and laying hose lines, and no homes have so far burned within the city limits.

But there was also no timeline yet for when residents of the towns might return home, and authorities said it would take hours, even days, to fully assess the extent of nearby damage from the so-called Elk Complex Fire, which started last Thursday.

Worsening conditions, including gusting winds, have prompted expanding evacuation orders in the last two days, including a renewed call on Tuesday for residents of Featherville to leave before it was too late, Eaker said.

"We are cautiously optimistic about what we can do to defend the towns but Mother Nature is in charge and she can deal some pretty rough cards," he said.

It was the second time in as many years that a massive wildfire has threatened Pine and Featherville, which were mostly emptied by Wednesday as the fire grew to nearly 112,000 acres.

The only road in and out of Pine and Featherville has been closed to all but fire personnel, and residents who leave the area are not being allowed to return. Fire managers were preparing for wind gusts of up to 30 miles per hour predicted for Thursday.

Meanwhile in Utah, a fast-moving blaze that broke out on Tuesday had destroyed at least 13 houses in affluent developments in the scrub oak and sagebrush foothills on the outskirts of Park City, fire officials said.

The so-called Rockport Fire in north central Utah is menacing an area where a single home can be worth as much as $50 million, said Park City Fire District Chief Paul Hewitt.

Authorities said evacuation orders would remain in place for the time being for the several upscale developments in the path of a fire estimated at 1,500 acres. The evacuation affects from 250 to 400 homes.

In western Colorado, a wind-stoked wildfire burning in mountainous terrain near Glenwood Springs threatens 20 structures and prompted the evacuations of several residents, the Garfield County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

The so-called Red Canyon Fire has burned 350 acres and is 10 percent contained, but erratic gusty winds make its growth potential high.

headline: Two men charged in Miami with financing foreign terrorist groups

8:31am EDT

A U.S. citizen and a foreign national were charged in federal court in Miami on Tuesday with providing financing and recruits to al Qaeda and other foreign terrorist organizations fighting in Syria and other places.

Gufran Ahmed Kauser Mohammed, a 30-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen born in India, and Mohamed Hussein Said, a 25-year-old Kenyan, were arraigned on a 15-count indictment charging them with links to three U.S.-designated terrorist organizations that have operated in Iraq, Syria and Somalia.

Both men, who were arrested in Saudi Arabia and turned over to U.S. custody last week, pleaded not guilty and were ordered held without bond pending trial.

"They both requested trial by jury, " said Silvia Beatriz Pinera-Vazquez, a lawyer for Hussein Said.

The men are accused of having used Western Union to wire a total of $96,000 to an al Qaeda affiliate, al-Nusra Front, which is fighting to topple President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, and al Shabaab, a militant group fighting to impose its strict interpretation of Islamic law on Somalia.

"There is overwhelming evidence that each of these defendants participated in securing money to support terrorist organizations overseas," said U.S. Attorney Ricardo Del Toro.

Del Toro outlined how for at least two years an undercover agent had maintained an online relationship with Mohammed, posing as a formerly imprisoned al Qaeda fighter.

"The money was to help Said in getting fighters out of Africa and into Syria," Del Toro said.

The men have also been accused of recruiting or trying to recruit individuals overseas to join rebels linked to al Qaeda.

Del Toro told the court that Said had provided copies of passports for three "terrorists" he said were willing and available to go to Syria, and said one of the men was linked to the Bella Vista bar bombing in Mombasa in May 2012 and another was tied to the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1998.

The case is being prosecuted in Miami because some of the Western Union wire transfers were sent to a Florida-based undercover agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

headline: Father of Chechen killed by FBI in Florida seeks justice for son

8:31am EDT

A Chechen fatally shot while being questioned by the FBI about his ties to one of the accused Boston Marathon bombing suspects was "a good boy" whose killing was "unjustified," the man's father and his attorneys said on Tuesday.

Abdulbaki Todashev, whose 27-year-old son Ibragim was shot in Florida on May 22 while being interrogated by the FBI and Massachusetts State Police, spoke about his son through an interpreter at a news conference arranged by the two Florida law firms now representing his family.

"My son was a very good boy," Todashev said. "His life was cut short," he added, saying his only hope was that "I will be able to achieve justice for my son."

The elder Todashev recently arrived in the United States from Russia to retain the lawyers now looking into possible civil action against the FBI. His son's death stemmed from a probe into the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, which killed three people and injured more than 260 in the worst mass-casualty attack carried out on U.S. soil since 9/11.

Ibragim Todashev, who trained as a mixed martial arts fighter, was an acquaintance of Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and worked out at the same gym used by Tsarnaev in Boston before moving to Florida, according to attorney Eric Ludin.

The FBI has said Todashev was being questioned at his apartment in Orlando when he suddenly attacked an agent and was shot and killed. Abdulbaki Todashev has openly questioned that account and said his son was unarmed when he was shot seven times.

He has also dismissed U.S. media reports following his son's death suggesting his son may have grabbed a kitchen knife or tried to wrest a gun from an agent as "absurd," saying there was no reason trained officers could not subdue a lone young man without killing him.

Ludin said it was inappropriate to publicly theorize about what led up to the shooting, pending the results of an ongoing review by the U.S. Justice Department and State Attorney Jeff Ashton in Florida.

He stressed that the case centered on official accountability, however.

"We think it was an unjustified killing," Ludin said.



headline: Topless activist on hunger strike in New Jersey jail
byline: By David Dankwa

day sentence related to an arrest for topless sunbathing is set to be released by the end of the week from a New Jersey jail, where she is currently on a hunger strike, officials said.

Phoenix Feeley, a New York resident, is serving the sentence in the Monmouth County Correctional Institution for refusing to pay $816 in fines in connection with her 2008 arrest at a beach in Spring Lake where she was sunbathing topless in violation of a town ordinance in an act of civil disobedience.

Monmouth County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Cynthia Scott declined to provide the exact day Feeley will be released, although August 16 marks the end of the sentence imposed by a municipal judge.

Scott said Feeley is currently in the correctional facility's infirmary and on constant watch because she has not eaten in nine days, choosing to only drink water.

"Her vitals are being checked regularly and she remains in good health," Scott said, adding that Feeley was offered an organic supplement but declined to take it.

Feeley is a member of GoTopless, an organization that is campaigning for the right of women to go topless in public on the basis of gender equality. According to the organization, New Jersey is one of about a dozen states in the country with ambiguous topless laws. Three states - Indiana, Utah and Tennessee - have outright bans on women going shirtless in public.

This is not the first time Feeley's topless agenda has brushed with the law. Seven years ago she was arrested in New York for baring her chest on the streets. She sued and won a lawsuit against the New York Police Department. It is now legal in New York for a woman, as well as a man, to go topless in public for noncommercial activity.



headline: Judge finds no evidence of eavesdropping on Guantanamo meetings
byline: By Jane Sutton
8:31am EDT

There is no evidence that anyone listened in to confidential meetings between a Guantanamo war crimes defendant and his lawyer, at least during the last two years, a U.S. military judge said in a ruling made public on Tuesday.

Therefore, the judge ruled, there is no need to issue an order prohibiting future monitoring of attorney-client meetings.

The ruling came in the death penalty case against alleged al Qaeda chieftain Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, a Saudi prisoner accused of orchestrating the bombing of the USS Cole off Yemen in 2000. Seventeen U.S. sailors were killed when suicide bombers detonated a boat full of explosives against the warship's hull.

In a February hearing at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in Cuba, Nashiri's lawyers asked that pretrial proceedings be halted until they could determine whether military or intelligence agents were eavesdropping on supposedly private meetings with the defendant.

The request followed revelations that what appeared to be smoke detectors in the meeting rooms were actually microphones, and that intelligence agents outside the courtroom had cut the public audio feed in the mistaken belief that secrets were being discussed at another hearing. The microphones and the outside kill switch have since been disabled, according to court testimony.

Prosecutors and a defense technical expert subsequently searched for records of any monitoring and found none, the ruling said.

At an evidentiary hearing in June, the top legal adviser for the task force that runs the prison and the Army officer who acts as the warden both testified under oath that there had been no monitoring of attorney-client meetings during their tenure.

The judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, said their testimony was convincing and no evidence had been found to contradict it.

"While neither officer could possibly testify to what may have happened for the prior 10 years of detention at Guantanamo Bay, their testimony established beyond the required evidentiary threshold that monitoring has not occurred" since the current charges were filed against Nashiri in September 2011, Pohl wrote.

The judge said the confidentiality of attorney-client communications was sacrosanct under U.S. law and that any unlawful invasion of those conversations by any government agency "would be viewed very dimly."

But without evidence of past monitoring, the judge said, it would be superfluous and "a judicial overreach" to issue an order prohibiting future monitoring.

Nashiri's lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment on the ruling, which was dated August 5 and released publicly on Tuesday.

A man with a handgun was holding two women and one man hostage at a bank where they are employed in northeastern Louisiana, but there were no reports of gunshots or violence, a local official said on Tuesday.

"A hostage situation is going on" at the bank, said Jane Netterville, spokeswoman for Tensas Parish.

The gunman is believed to be an employee of a local convenience store, and police have been in touch with members of his family to seek their help in ending the incident, she said. Netterville said she did not know the name of the gunman.

The standoff is at the Tensas State Bank in St. Joseph, a town of 1,135. State and local police were on the scene, she said.



headline: Polish military man reported missing on Oregon's Mount Hood
byline: By Teresa Carson
8:31am EDT

A member of the Polish armed forces who was in the United States for military training was missing on Mount Hood on Tuesday, two days after he told his roommate that he planned to scale the Oregon peak.

The roommate notified authorities when Sebastian Kinasiewicz did not return by Monday morning, the Hood River County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

It gave no further information about Kinasiewicz, who had been undergoing training in nearby Washington state conducted by a company that designs and produces drone aircraft.

Kinasiewicz, whose car was found parked at a trailhead, is described as a novice climber. He was carrying crampons, an ice axe and a back pack with warm clothing and water, but no other survival gear, the Sheriff's office said.

Witnesses reported they saw a lone climber on a route called Cooper Spur on the north side of the mountain Sunday, Mark Morford, a spokesman for Portland Mountain Rescue said. "That is a popular advanced route," Morford said.

"Mountain conditions are reasonably good," Morford said, "Rock fall is always a hazard this time of year."

An Oregon Army National Guard Black Hawk helicopter was deployed in the search on Tuesday, following searches by fixed wing aircraft on Monday. Ground teams included National Guard members and volunteers from Portland Mountain Rescue.

Morford said that Mount Hood is the second most climbed glaciated mountain in the world after Mount Fuji in Japan.

It is estimated that around 8,000 people climb Mount Hood every year, mostly between April and July, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Roughly two people die each year on the mountain.

Climbers are advised to file a route before climbing. Kinasiewicz's route was unknown.



headline: Florida resort hit by sinkhole invites guests to 'come on down'
byline: By Barbara Liston
8:31am EDT

share resort where a sinkhole devoured a building Sunday night said that it is open for business and next week's guests should "come on down."

Paul Caldwell, the general manager of Summer Bay Resorts, which is located 6 miles from Walt Disney World, made the pitch to guests at a news conference on Tuesday. He said that geological and structural testing under way on the 100-foot wide cavern and the surrounding buildings should be complete by Wednesday.

Guests staying in the downed building were evacuated by an alert security guard who ran inside to wake occupants as the structure was twisting and collapsing around him. No one was injured.

A total of 36 people were evacuated from two buildings on the sprawling 64-acre property, which has a total of 900 units, the resort said.

The state of Florida, which is prone to sinkholes because of its porous limestone foundation, is set this fall to begin the creation of a statewide geological map showing the relative vulnerabilities to sinkholes. The map could be used by local governments making decisions on building permits.

The map project received funding two weeks ago for its first stage with a $1.1 million grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which follows a spate of sinkholes in 2012 in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Debby, according to Patrick Gillespie, spokesman for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

Sinkholes are a common feature of Florida's landscape, typically becoming sites for springs, lakes and portions of rivers after they occur. They most commonly occur as a result of naturally acidic underground water flowing through and dissolving the underlying limestone. North and central Florida generally are more vulnerable than south Florida, Gillespie said.

In 2012, a long drought lowered the water table and emptied natural voids in the limestone, which then collapsed under the weight of torrential rains from Debby, Gillespie said.

In March, a sinkhole under a Tampa-area home opened and swallowed the bedroom of 37-year-old landscaper Jeff Bush, whose body was never recovered.

In 1981, in Winter Park near Orlando, a sinkhole measuring 320 feet wide and 90 feet deep swallowed a two-story house, part of a Porsche dealership and an Olympic-size swimming pool. The site is now an artificial lake.



headline: Defense in U.S. WikiLeaks trial says Army ignored Manning's bizarre acts
byline: By Tom Ramstack
8:31am EDT

Lawyers for Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier convicted of giving classified documents to WikiLeaks, sought to show during a sentencing hearing on Tuesday that the Army ignored his mental health problems and bizarre behavior.

Manning's violent outbursts and his emailing a supervisor a photo of himself in a dress and blond wig with the caption "This is my problem" were signs the gay soldier should not have a job as an intelligence analyst, defense attorney David Coombs told the court-martial.

Manning, a 25-year-old private first class, faces up to 90 years in prison after being convicted July 30 on 20 charges, including espionage and theft, in the biggest release of classified files in U.S. history.

Attorneys for Manning are expected to read a statement from him on Wednesday as they conclude their case in the last part of the trial. Sentencing by Judge Colonel Denise Lind could follow shortly after.

Manning's court-martial has drawn international scrutiny, and the trove of documents he provided catapulted WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, into the spotlight.

Coombs asked Manning's supervisor, former Master Sergeant Paul Adkins, why he did not remove Manning from his job as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010 when he showed erratic and sometimes violent behavior.

Coombs mentioned incidents in which Manning punched a soldier in the face, carved the words "I want" into a chair with a knife and flipped over a table while being reprimanded about being late to his job.

Adkins said his unit was short-staffed and needed Manning's analysis work.

"The biggest threat to our soldiers and our operational environment emerged from the Shia (Muslim) insurgent group, which PFC Manning helped to assess," said Adkins, who was demoted after the WikiLeaks release.

WRONG ASSESSMENT

He said he believed Manning was being helped by mental therapy. "I wrongly assessed that he was stable enough to continue his shift," Adkins said.

Coombs has asserted that the Army's failure to act on Manning's mental health problems contributed to his release of more than 700,000 secret diplomatic and military documents and videos.

Under questioning from prosecutor Captain Angel Overgaard, Adkins said Manning was among several soldiers in his unit who underwent psychological counseling for stress in Iraq.

Chief Warrant Officer Joshua Ehresman said that in a December 2009 incident Manning turned over a table with two computers on it while being reprimanded for tardiness.

"I felt as though he was going toward the weapons rack," Ehresman said. "I grabbed him and put him in a full nelson and put him on the bench."

Defense lawyers have sought to portray Manning as naive but well-intentioned and struggling with his sexual identity when he arrived in Iraq. His lawyers have said Manning wanted to show Americans the human cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The prosecution has portrayed Manning as arrogant in releasing the classified material and has tried to show damage that the leaks to WikiLeaks, a pro-transparency website, had done to the United States.

Judge Colonel Denise Lind overruled three of five defense objections to classified information presented during court sessions that were closed to the public and media.

The judge did not reveal the information but said it was proper "aggravation evidence" of the damage the releases did to U.S. foreign relations. She upheld the other two objections, saying the information presented by military officials was speculative.

old Colorado girl became the second fatality in five days in the Pikes Peak region when she was swept down a swollen creek after apparently taking shelter under a bridge from rain and pounding hail, police said on Tuesday.

Rose Hammes had gone for a walk on Monday afternoon, and called her parents to say she was taking shelter under the bridge, Colorado Springs police said in a statement. When her parents could not reach the girl on her cell phone, they called police.

Search and rescue crews searched the area downstream and hours later found her body in a canal off Sand Creek, about a half-mile from where she was last seen, police spokeswoman Barbara Miller said.

Hammes is the second person to die from rising waters and flooding as daily monsoonal rains have saturated the area for more than a week. The El Paso County Coroner's Office ruled she died from blunt force trauma and drowning.

Her death came after a 53-year-old man drowned on Friday when heavy rains sent a wall of water and debris down a canyon denuded by a 2012 wildfire and onto a highway. His body was found covered with debris outside his vehicle along the road.

The debris flow from that flash flood roared into the town of Manitou Springs, about 6-1/2 miles west of Colorado Springs at the foot of Pikes Peak, the mountaintop whose panoramic summit vistas inspired the song "America the Beautiful."

More than 30 buildings in the downtown area were damaged or destroyed.

Three other people initially reported missing after the Manitou Springs flood, including a woman seen clinging to a tree along the banks of a rising creek, have all been accounted for, authorities said.



headline: New Jersey Powerball winners know how they'll spend money
byline: By Victoria Cavaliere
8:31am EDT

The 16 New Jersey workers who won a third of last week's $448 million Powerball jackpot said on Tuesday that many of them suffered losses during Superstorm Sandy and planned to use their winnings to rebuild their lives.

The co-workers, nicknamed "Ocean's 16," were introduced to the public at a news conference in Toms River, New Jersey. They got a check for $86,054,355, their share of the jackpot after taxes, lottery officials said.

They produced the second of three winning tickets to the jackpot. The first winner, who came forward last week, was Minnesota engineer Paul White and the final holder has not yet stepped forward publicly.

Six members of the group said their homes had been directly damaged by Sandy last year, and most said they planned to keep working at the Ocean County Vehicles Services Department.

"Ocean's 16" winner Darlene Riccio said she lost the home she had rented with her daughter for five years during the October 2012 superstorm. They have been staying with family since, she said.

"It has been an extremely rough year," she said at an emotional and often humorous news conference. "The first thing I'm going to do is buy me and my daughter a home and bring my dog back home."

When her co-workers informed her they had won, "I thought they were joking with me and that it was the worst joke ever. I'm still in shock," she added.

She said on her Facebook page that she has quit her second part-time job at a retail store.

The nine women and seven men, who described themselves as good friends, bought 48 Quick Pick tickets, each putting in $6. Their winning ticket was purchased at an Acme Markets store in the New Jersey shore town of Little Egg Harbor.

The woman who bought the tickets, Lisa Presutto, said she had stopped at the Acme on her way home for groceries and was one of the first to realize they won last Wednesday's drawing.

"I immediately started shaking," she said.

One winner, Barbara Jo Riivald, said her late father, former State Sen. John Brown, had been instrumental in creating the New Jersey Lottery and sponsored the legislation that created it.

"I wish he was here to share in the moment. The only thing I wanted to do that next morning was pick up the phone and call him," she said.

William Seeley of Manahawkin said he planned to build a log cabin on "multiple acres of land," watch NASCAR races on television and throw a big party.

"I lost my mom to cancer, and my dad's going through it right now," he said. "That's the first place I stopped was Pop's house. Started crying in front of him and told him I loved him."

He quickly added: "We're a happy bunch ... We're very happy, happy, happy."

The third as-yet unclaimed winning ticket was sold at a Super Stop &amp; Shop supermarket in South Brunswick, New Jersey, officials said.

The odds of winning the jackpot were about one in 175 million.

Powerball tickets are sold in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Five states - Kansas, Maryland, Delaware, North Dakota and Ohio - allow the winners to remain anonymous, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.



headline: Friends of accused Boston bomber plead not guilty to obstruction
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

Two college friends of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy for removing evidence from Tsarnaev's dormitory room three days after the attack.

The two students, who are from Kazakhstan, are accused in federal court of removing a backpack containing fireworks and a laptop computer from Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth as the FBI was searching for him.

Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both 19, could face 25 years in prison or deportation if convicted.

An attorney for Kadyrbayev said his client cooperated with investigators from the moment they approached him, turning over Tsarnaev's computer and telling the FBI where it could find the backpack.

"Dias comes from a former Soviet-bloc region where police routinely are distrusted," attorney Robert Stahl told reporters. "Yet when authorities first approached him, he fully cooperated and for nearly 12 hours over two days Dias answered the FBI's questions without an attorney or a Kazakh consular official present."

Tsarnaev, 20, is accused of setting off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line on April 15, killing three people and injuring 264 in one of the worst attacks on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001.

He is also charged in the death of a university police officer from whom he and his older brother, Tamerlan, tried unsuccessfully to steal a gun, according to authorities.

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were led into the courtroom handcuffed and dressed in orange prison uniforms and white sneakers. They smiled and nodded to family members seated in the courtroom.

REMOVING EVIDENCE

Each is charged with removing evidence including the backpack with fireworks from Tsarnaev's room in an effort to protect him three days after the attack, when the FBI released still images of the Tsarnaev brothers at the site of the bombing.

That FBI release - a call for the public's help in identifying the suspects - panicked the brothers. Their attempt to flee ended in a late-night gunfight with police in the suburb of Watertown on April 18 in which Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed.

After a day-long manhunt, police found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a home.

The bag was dropped in a dumpster outside the New Bedford, Massachusetts, apartment where the pair lived. Investigators later recovered it from a landfill.

Tazhayakov's attorney, Arkady Bukh, said his client had not given Kadyrbayev consent to throw the bag away.

Neither is charged with involvement in the bombing.

Stahl said he hoped Kadyrbayev would be acquitted and allowed to return to his family in Kazakhstan.

The two have been in federal custody since May 1, when lesser charges of conspiracy were filed against them. They were indicted on the obstruction-of-justice charges on August 8.

A third friend, Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is engaged in talks with prosecutors aimed at settling a charge of making false statements in a terrorism investigation.

Tazhayakov's father, Amir Ismagulov, told reporters through a translator his son was "shocked" at the bombing but had become a scapegoat.

Ismagulov, who said he owned oil fields in Kazakhstan, said his son had intended to study petroleum engineering in Texas after he finished his studies in Massachusetts.

A gun instructor in central Ohio accidentally shot a student in the arm during a gun safety class, according to authorities.

Michael Piemonte, 26, was shot on Saturday after the handgun held by instructor Terry Dunlap, 73, discharged during a class in Carroll, according to a Fairfield County Sheriff's Office incident report.

Piemonte was hit in the right arm, between his elbow and his arm pit, he said during an interview on Tuesday. He was taken to a hospital by ambulance and released that evening.

Piemonte declined to elaborate on the incident and Dunlap was not immediately available to comment.

Piemonte was struck by a .38-caliber bullet fired from a .357-caliber five-shot revolver, according to the sheriff's department report, which described the shooting as an accident.

Carroll is a village about 20 miles southeast of Columbus.

Ohio's concealed carry law was amended in December to require residents to demonstrate competency with the weapon only once, rather than each time their concealed carry permit expires.



headline: For Boston FBI, 'Whitey' Bulger verdict a step 'to earn back trust'
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

Drug Enforcement Agency agent Pamela Hay had a problem: She wasn't convinced her FBI counterparts wanted to catch the fugitive mobster.

The former leader of Boston's "Winter Hill" crime gang by then was in his sixth year of hiding, after fleeing the city in 1994 on a tip from a corrupt FBI agent that arrest was imminent.

"I had to sort out what was going on, did the FBI really want to find Bulger, if Bulger was found, what was it going to uncover?" Hay recalled in an interview on Tuesday.

She soon determined, however, her FBI colleagues were very serious about catching Bulger. "They worked hard, almost like they wanted to regain their reputation," she said.

Bulger, once the most feared criminal in Boston, on Monday was found guilty of 31 of 32 counts in a sweeping racketeering case that proved him a murderer, drug dealer and extortionist. A jury convicted him a little more than two years after FBI agents caught up with him, living in hiding under an alias in a Santa Monica, California seaside apartment.

The verdict, which legal experts said is likely to leave the 83-year-old in prison for his remaining years, is a step towards redemption for the Boston office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Bulger, who early in his criminal career had served time on the Alcatraz prison island off San Francisco, maintained brutal control on Boston's underworld thanks to corrupt relationships with FBI agents that shared his Irish ethnicity and turned a blind eye to his crimes in exchange for information they could use against the Italian Mafia.

"This trial is a start for the FBI to earn back the trust of the public once again," said Walter Prince, a former federal prosecutor in Boston who is now a partner with the law firm Prince Lobel. "It's going to take a while for the FBI to put those criminal activities behind them."

Justice Department officials in Boston admitted that Bulger's case had long been a black mark on the bureau.

"This day of reckoning for Bulger has been a long time in coming. Too long, in fact, due to his decades long of corruption - and corrupting law enforcement officials in this city," U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said on Monday after the jury rendered its verdict.

"It was a corruption that not only allowed him to operate a violent organization, but allowed him to slip away when honest law enforcement was closing in," she said.

CORRUPT TIES

During Bulger's two-month trial, jurors heard about a long relationship between the defendant and his FBI handlers, John Connolly and John Morris.

Connolly and Bulger were first put in touch by the gangster's older brother, William, who became the powerful president of the state Senate and wanted to help out a friend who grew up in the same South Boston neighborhood.

Bulger agreed to meet with Connolly, reluctantly at first, but eventually the two became close. Connolly regularly entertained Bulger and his partner-in-crime Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi, inviting them over for home-cooked meals, according to testimony at the trial.

Connolly developed a 700-page informant file in more than decade of regular meetings with Bulger, who claimed that he paid the agent for tips but never provided any of his own.

Connolly is serving a 40-year prison sentence on racketeering and murder convictions. His boss, Morris, is a free man and testified that he accepted money and gifts from Bulger, and offered tips that led to mob executions, including that of Edward Halloran.

Halloran had approached the FBI to offer tips of his own - a crime that Bulger regarded as punishable by death.

"Not a day in my life has gone by that I haven't thought about this," Morris said about the murder of that gangster and another man, uninvolved in gang business, who had the misfortune to be driving Halloran home when the "Winter Hill" gang arrived.

Bulger adamantly denied being an informant and cursed at Morris when he took the witness stand, calling him a liar. Still, Bulger's lawyers acknowledged a close relationship with law enforcement.

They plan to appeal the verdict, saying that rulings by U.S. District Judge Denise Casper and her predecessor on the case prevented them from making their best defense - that Bulger had been promised immunity by prosecutors.

Bulger's lawyers never said why prosecutors would have offered their client immunity if he was not an informant, an argument that they wanted to make in the courtroom.

"I was somewhat taken by the defense of immunity I think it was novel and perhaps in another day and another time it would have prevailed," said Barry Slotnick, a defense lawyer whose clients have included the late reputed New York mob boss Joseph Colombo.

"He controlled organized crime in Boston and the FBI was desperate to get info from him, whether they got it or not and so as a result of their need to ingratiate themselves with him, it all went aside."

headline: GM adds week of production in Ohio to meet Cruze demand

8:31am EDT

General Motors Co. has added a week of production at its Chevrolet Cruze factory in Lordstown, Ohio, this month to meet growing U.S. demand for the compact car, a spokeswoman for the largest U.S. automaker said on Tuesday.

The Lordstown Assembly plant was originally scheduled to be closed the week of August 26, United Auto Workers Local 1112 said on its website. Now, workers will continue to assemble the cars "as normal" that week, the union local said.

"Sales have been brisk," said GM spokesman Annalisa Bluhm. "We didn't want to lose momentum so we decided to abstain from taking the week off."

U.S. sales of the Cruze have risen 24 percent during the first seven months of 2013, better than the 9 percent sales jump for GM overall. In July, Cruze sales shot up 70 percent.

GM ended July with about a 50-day supply of the Cruze, less than the company's 68-day supply for its overall lineup, GM executives said earlier this month.

The current generation Cruze has been assembled at Lordstown since September 2010. The Cruze was first introduced in 2009, the same year GM emerged from bankruptcy protection.

The global financial crisis forced GM as well as its U.S. rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group LLC to close several plants. Now, U.S. automakers have running their U.S. factories around the clock to satisfy rising demand.

A UAW official could not be immediately reached for comment. UAW Local 1112 is one of two locals that represent workers at the Lordstown plant, part of a complex that employs about 4,500 hourly and salaried workers.



headline: U.S. court demands decision on Nevada nuclear waste project
byline: By Lawrence Hurley
8:31am EDT

stalled nuclear waste project at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

On a 2-1 vote, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered the commission to promptly decide to license the project or reject the application.

It was unclear how much difference the court ruling would make to a long-running, politically divisive saga over safely storing nuclear waste, as the United States continues to debate how big a role nuclear power should play in the nation's energy mix.

The Obama administration, which picks the Senate-confirmed members of the nuclear commission, and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, whose home state is Nevada, are among those eager to scuttle the Yucca project. They would be in a position to deny any future funds for the project.

"Under the current political environment, it seems unlikely additional funds will be given" to the project, even if the commission does issue a license, said Jack Spencer, a nuclear policy expert at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation.

But he said the ruling indicated that, as a long-term proposition, "Yucca is not dead" because there could still be a way to revive it, possibly in a modified form.

The project, in discussion since the 1970s, calls for the nation's nuclear waste to be buried inside Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.

Congress chose the site in the 1980s because it is a secure location surrounded by federally owned land. Since 1983, the government has spent almost $15 billion assessing its suitability for long-term nuclear waste disposal.

But funding has been dropped under the Obama administration, leaving the United States still with no solution to the vexing problem.

Nuclear waste - which can stay radioactive for thousands of years - is now stored temporarily at more than 100 sites at nuclear plants around the country, a move approved by the NRC on the assumption that a national repository would be built within 60 years.

PARTIES TO SUIT

If Yucca Mountain is deemed safe, it should proceed, said the states of Washington and South Carolina, both of which currently host nuclear waste storage facilities. These states, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and other parties had sued the NRC over its inaction.

They successfully argued before the court in Washington that the commission must continue to work on the Energy Department's Yucca application even though the Obama administration has said it wants to abandon the project and Congress has not appropriated enough funds for it.

The ruling was not unexpected. The court had signaled in a decision last year that it would likely rule against the commission unless Congress specifically voted to terminate the project. Congress has taken no action.

D.C. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh said in the ruling that the commission "has not acted, and Congress has not altered the legal landscape." As a result, he added, "the commission is simply flouting the law."

He was referring to the 1983 Nuclear Waste Policy Act that says the commission has to either approve or disapprove an application from the Energy Department for a nuclear waste repository.

Philip Jones, president of NARUC, said in a statement that the ruling would direct the commission "to comply with the law and continue its legally obligated review of the license."

A commission spokesman said officials were reviewing the decision but had no further comment.

In a dissenting opinion, Chief Judge Merrick Garland said the lack of funds limits the impact of the court's ruling. He said it amounts to "little more than ordering the commission to spend part of those funds unpacking its boxes, and the remainder packing them up again."

The commission has around $11 million left to spend on the project.

Robert Andersen, a lawyer representing the Nevada county where the repository would be located, took issue with Garland's assessment of the project's funding.

Andersen said the judge was "wholly mistaken" in focusing on what the commission had left to spend because Congress "never appropriates upfront money to complete decades long projects."

headline: Lawyers for U.S. soldier in Afghan rampage seek prosecutors' ouster
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

Lawyers for a U.S. soldier who pleaded guilty in June to the slaughter of 16 Afghan civilians are expected to seek the dismissal of the prosecution team at a hearing on Tuesday, claiming that the fairness of the soldier's upcoming sentencing proceeding is at risk.

Military prosecutors were mistakenly provided an unredacted copy of a court-ordered mental health evaluation of Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, which civilian defense lawyer John Henry Browne has said would give them an undue advantage in the sentencing phase of the case.

The motion seeking to remove the prosecutors is among those filed by Bales' lawyers to be considered at Tuesday's pre-sentencing hearing, an army spokesman said. It comes less than a week before a sentencing proceeding set to decide if Bales will ever have a chance at parole.

Bales, 40, pleaded guilty in June to walking off his base in Afghanistan's Kandahar province before dawn on March 11, 2012, and gunning down civilians in their homes in at least two villages.

Bales, a decorated veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, faces life in prison under a deal that spared him the death penalty. A military jury is still to determine whether he will ever be eligible for parole.

The attack marked the worst case of civilian slaughter blamed on a lone, rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War, and further strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.

Upon pleading guilty in June, Bales acknowledged the killings and told the court there was "not a good reason in this world" for his actions.

Defense attorneys have argued that Bales, a father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his deployment to Afghanistan.



headline: Newark 'stop and frisk' wins praise after NY City tactics rejected
byline: By Victoria Cavaliere
8:31am EDT

Police in the city of Newark, New Jersey, have enacted new, highly transparent "stop and frisk" procedures that civil libertarians have called a model for the country and an alternative to the New York City policy rejected by a U.S. judge.

New Jersey's largest city, about 10 miles west of New York City, will on Thursday begin reporting data collected from the first month of its "Police Transparency Policy," disclosing the race, gender, age and English proficiency of everyone that Newark police officers stop and frisk.

"It really should serve as a model for the rest of the state and even the rest of the nation," said Udi Ofer, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.

The Center For Constitutional Rights and the New York Civil Liberties Union had sued New York City over its "stop and frisk" tactics, and a U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled on Monday that New York City had violated the constitutional rights of racial minorities who were unfairly targeted by the New York City Police Department.

Officers often frisked young minority men or searched their pockets for weapons or contraband before letting them go, in a violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment that protects against unreasonable searches and seizures as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits intentional discrimination based on race, the judge said in her 195-page decision.

The ruling was a stinging rebuke for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is entering the final months of his 12 years in office, and could trip up NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who President Barack Obama has indicated may be a possible nominee for U.S. secretary of homeland security.

Bloomberg has vowed to challenge the judge's finding, arguing that "stop and frisk" contributed to the city's dwindling crime rate, but the judge ruled the efficiency of program was irrelevant.

By contrast, the new "stop and frisk" procedures in Newark were being rolled out just as Newark Mayor Cory Booker seeks higher office in Tuesday's special primary election to select a new U.S. senator for the state of New Jersey.

Besides data about the suspects who are stopped, Newark will also publish data on the location of every stop and frisk performed, regardless of whether the search resulted in an arrest.

The reports will also include the names of the officers involved and the legal justification for the stop.

The data will be uploaded to the Newark Police Department's website and viewable by the public on the 15th of each month, with the first report due out on Thursday, police officials said. Previously, officers were required to capture and record far fewer details and the information was released annually.

"I applaud the police department for doing it voluntarily," said Darius Charney, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, and a lead attorney on the case in New York City.

"It also helps the police department, because if they are doing the right thing, if they are policing constitutionally, if they are policing fairly, I think the data will bear that out so that will support and increase the public confidence in the police department," Charney said.

Los Angeles, Philadelphia and New York are among the U.S. cities that publicly disclose stop and frisk information, but all three cities were sued before enacting that policy, he said.

The breadth and frequency of the Newark reporting will be the most comprehensive and transparent by any police department in the country, according to the ACLU's Ofer.

"We are going to be monitoring the data very closely to see how stop and frisk is being used and who is being targeted," Ofer said.

After citizens complained of excessive force, discriminatory policing and other abuses by the Newark Police Department, the U.S. Justice Department in 2011 opened an investigation into whether there were "systemic violations" of the Constitution by officers. These results were expected soon.

The Police Transparency Policy will also require the department to make public its internal affairs information, including the number and nature of complaints filed against officers and the outcomes of those complaints.

headline: California grants transgender students restroom, sports choices
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

California public schools must allow transgender students to choose which restrooms to use and whether to join the girls' or boys' sports teams under a law signed by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown on Monday.

Supporters say it is the first state law to require equal access to sex-segregated school facilities based on the gender with which the student identifies instead of their biological gender.

But opponents say the law is too vague, and could lead to abuses.

Some school districts, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, already allow students to participate in sports programs and choose school facilities in accordance with their gender identity, said Carlos Alcala, spokesman for the law's author, Democratic Assemblyman Tom Ammiano of San Francisco.

Under this law, all of the state's districts would have to do that.

"There were other school districts that made it very difficult on students, so that's why we felt the law was necessary," Alcala said.

Last month, the Arcadia School District in Southern California settled a transgender discrimination lawsuit filed when a middle school student, who was born female but identified as male, was barred from using male restrooms and locker rooms at school.

Alcala said that at least one other U.S. state had policies addressing transgender student access issues, but California was the first state to enact a law mandating access to restrooms and sports teams.

Supporters said the law would provide a morale boost for transgender students, who often feel isolated and frequently endure abuse.

"It's going to send them a message that they are a part of the school community and that they are valued and that we want to see them participate fully and want to see them succeed," said Ilona Turner, legal director for the Transgender Law Center, a nonprofit legal transgender right organization that co-sponsored the bill. "That's a powerful message that, frankly, they have not been getting up to this point," Turner said.

Dozens of civil rights, gay rights and educational groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union of California and the California Teachers Association, supported the bill.

A handful of conservative and religious groups, including the California Catholic Conference and Concerned Women for America opposed it, according to documents filed by the Senate Rules Committee.

Pro-family policy organization Capitol Resource Institute opposed the bill.

"They didn't need to force this on every single California school district," said Karen England, a spokeswoman for the Capitol Resource Institute.

England said the law is too vague and provides no guidelines for implementation or to guard against abuse.

"Most Californians don't want their daughters showering or going to the restroom with boys," she said.



headline: New Jersey's Booker expected to dominate Senate primary election
byline: By Barbara Goldberg
8:31am EDT

Newark Mayor Cory Booker appeared poised for victory on Tuesday as New Jersey held a special election to choose party nominees in the race to fill the state's empty U.S. Senate seat.

Booker, a Democrat, held a strong lead in public opinion polls, with a 37-point edge over his nearest challenger among likely Democratic voters in one recent survey.

But with the primary being held amid the summer vacation season, voter turnout will have a significant impact on the actual results, said David Redlawsk, a professor of political science at Rutgers University and director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling.

"In this election, it's dramatically difficult to figure out who a likely voter is. Half the state's down the shore," Redlawsk said.

At a polling place inside a Maplewood church, 30 election workers staffed idle voting machines and passed the hours playing games on their cell phones and chatting with one another in the otherwise empty room.

As of mid-afternoon, 50 Democrats and not a single Republican had cast ballots in District 20, one of four districts voting at the church, an election worker said. That compared with about 500 votes cast in the district in the last presidential election, he said.

"To have a special election in the middle of vacation time is a problem," said Ian Grodman, chairman of the Democratic Committee in Maplewood, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans seven to one.

"A very small number of people will be making the determination for the greater population," he said.

Concern and controversy over the timing of the election emerged promptly after the Senate seat came open with the death in June of Senator Frank Lautenberg at age 89. The liberal Democrat had been elected to the Senate five times.

To fill the seat, Republican Governor Chris Christie called the August 13 primary and set a special election for October 16, three weeks ahead of the November 5 general election, when he is seeking re-election.

Democrats charged that the two fall elections should have been scheduled for the same day but that Christie was avoiding being on the same ballot as Booker, who could attract both strong Democratic and minority turnout.

Also seeking the Democratic party's nomination are Representative Frank Pallone, who has polled in second place, Representative Rush Holt and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver.

But they have found little traction against the well-funded and well-known Booker, considered a rising political star.

The Newark mayor has enjoyed the support of celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and he has made himself a presence on social media with a prolific Twitter account and a penchant for responding to constituent requests.

He once rushed into a burning building to help save a woman from the smoke and flames in her apartment.

"Famously willing to run after a mugger or into a burning building, and to move into the projects and play late-night basketball with kids there, the Rhodes scholar and Stanford- and Yale-educated lawyer grabbed headlines but also restored a sense of hope to the neglected city," the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote in its endorsement of Booker.

The mayor is credited with bringing $1 billion in new development to Newark, including the city's first new downtown hotel in 40 years and the relocation of major companies, including Panasonic, which is building a new North American headquarters downtown.

The New York Times, in its endorsement of Booker, noted that under his tenure, Newark schools got a $100 million gift from Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.

Booker has "made a national name for himself by bringing new thinking, honesty and compassion to the hidebound, corrupt and cold city government in Newark," the Times wrote.

Opponents have criticized his ambitious nature and asked whether he is more concerned with himself than with his constituents. An article in The New York Times last week raised questions about the circumstances of Booker's stake in an Internet start-up company and his close involvement with Silicon Valley executives.

On the Republican side, Steve Lonegan, former mayor of Bogota, New Jersey, is vying with Alieta Eck, a physician, for the party's spot in the October 16 special general election.

Lonegan, a Tea Party conservative, led Eck 74 to 10 percent among Republican likely voters in a Quinnipiac University poll taken earlier this month.

That poll showed Booker leading 54 to 29 percent over Lonegan in a general election match-up.

old military school in Colorado.

Lieutenant General Michelle Johnson, welcomed with a Change of Command ceremony, told a crowd of hundreds of cadets, staff, service leaders and supporters that she looked forward to the challenge of leading the academy through both its triumphs and its challenges.

"We can find meaning in adversity, and there are lessons from overcoming negative experiences and to grow stronger through them," she said.

Johnson takes over for Lieutenant General Mike Gould, a 1976 graduate who was superintendent for four years and who is set to retire in October. Johnson is the academy's 19th superintendent.

The arrival of a female chief signals a change for a school that has seen its share of sexual scandals, most recently the dismissal of cadet Jamil Cooks after his April conviction on a charge of abusive sexual conduct after he pleaded guilty to the unlawful entry into the rooms of two female cadets.

In 2003, reports that dozens of female academy cadets had been sexually assaulted by fellow cadets in incidents covering a decade, but that academy officials ignored or downplayed their complaints, led to Congressional hearings.

Johnson, a 1981 academy graduate, was the academy's first female cadet wing commander. She comes to the academy after serving as the Deputy Chief of Staff of Operations and Intelligence at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Johnson attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and earned a master's degree in politics and economics.

The academy was authorized by President Dwight. D. Eisenhower in 1954, offering a four-year program to graduate cadets with a bachelor of science and a commission as second lieutenant in the Air Force.

headline: NYPD's federal watchdog eager to 'give back' to NY City
byline: By Joseph Ax
8:31am EDT

When lawyer Peter Zimroth was asked to become the new federal watchdog for the New York City Police Department's "stop and frisk" program two weeks ago, he jumped at the chance to serve the city he grew up in.

"New York is in my blood," said Zimroth, a partner at Arnold &amp; Porter, who had previously worked as the city's chief lawyer from 1987 to 1989.

"The job that I had as corporation counsel was the best legal job anyone could have," he said in an interview. "It was a chance to give back, and that's how I view this too."

On Monday, after ruling that the NYPD's controversial tactics amounted to racial profiling, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin appointed Zimroth to develop and implement a series of reforms to the program. The judge had called Zimroth a couple of weeks ago to make sure he could take the job before she announced it in the ruling.

In selecting Zimroth, Scheindlin chose an experienced lawyer whose resume includes stints as a federal and state prosecutor, a law school professor and a prominent civil litigator.

That diverse background will command respect from both sides, despite a potentially chilly reception from City Hall, colleagues said. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Monday that the judge put the NYPD "into receivership" based on flimsy evidence.

Zimroth, 70, said he would strive to balance the need for effective policing with the reforms ordered by Scheindlin.

"She made it very clear that this is supposed to be a collaborative effort," he said. "The role is not an adversarial one. I've had a lot of different experiences on a lot of different sides and what I've learned is that you have to listen to people - no one person has the answer."

As the city's corporation counsel under Mayor Ed Koch, Zimroth represented the NYPD and other city agencies. He worked closely with police while serving as the chief assistant for Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau and as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office.

He also has worked on constitutional issues. He previously served as one of three members of New York's Capital Defender Office, which provided representation for defendants facing the death penalty. In New Jersey, he represents a mosque that is challenging a town's zoning laws as discriminatory.

"From the city's perspective, they have a very fine lawyer who was the city's chief lawyer and who will be sensitive to the issues impacted by Judge Scheindlin's order," said Victor Kovner, who succeeded Zimroth as corporation counsel.

Christopher Dunn, associate legal director for the New York Civil Liberties Union, which brought one of two lawsuits that resulted in Scheindlin's order, said he was pleased with Zimroth's selection.

"There can be no complaint that he's biased against the city," Dunn said. "Having someone like Peter Zimroth just completely changes the debate about the role of a monitor."

Last month, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo named Zimroth to a commission investigating public corruption in the state.

While serving as the city's chief lawyer, Zimroth was known as the architect of the city's public campaign financing law, created in response to a series of corruption scandals.

At Arnold &amp; Porter, Zimroth has focused on products liability, securities and other areas. He is married to the accomplished New York stage actress Estelle Parsons.

Scheindlin's order requires Zimroth to monitor the NYPD's progress and issue reports on its compliance. City officials said they would appeal and ask the appellate court to stop the order from taking effect in the meantime.

There is little doubt Zimroth is aware of the disagreements that arise when judges place limits on city policies. In a 2008 legal journal article, he reflected on his experiences as the city's top lawyer in dealing with such situations.

"I did not think that in general it was a good thing for the courts to have such a substantial role in the day-to-day operation of city government," Zimroth wrote.

"But I also believed that the courts played a necessary role in ensuring that government agencies lived by the laws .... One of the hardest parts of my job as corporation counsel was to deal with the tensions created by these conflicting perspectives."



headline: 'Whitey' Bulger guilty of 11 murders in sweeping Boston mob case
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

James "Whitey" Bulger, a brutal gangster who ruled over Boston's criminal underworld in the 1970s and '80s and evaded capture for 16 years, was found guilty of murder and racketeering by a jury on Monday and will likely spend the rest of his life in prison.

The 83-year-old Bulger, dressed in a gray shirt, dark pants and white sneakers, stood quietly as the verdict was read, showing little emotional response to the decision by jurors to convict him after five days of deliberation in Boston federal court. His sentencing was scheduled for November 13.

A legendary figure in Boston's underworld, Bulger ran the "Winter Hill" crime gang after coming to power in a mob war that resulted in the death of members of rival gangs. He cemented his grip on Boston's crime scene through ties with corrupt Federal Bureau of Investigation officials who shared his Irish ethnicity and turned a blind eye to his crimes in exchange for information they could use against the Italian Mafia.

During the two month-long trial, the 12 jurors heard vivid descriptions of Bulger's crimes. They included brazen daylight shootings of fellow criminals, the terrifying extortion of a victim at whose crotch Bulger aimed a machine gun and how one associate would pull teeth from the mouths of dead victims, hoping to make the bodies harder to identify.

Nicknamed "Whitey" because of the shock of light-colored hair he had as a young man, Bulger fled Boston in 1994 after a tip from a corrupt agent that his arrest was imminent.

He spent 16 years on the run, many of them on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted" list along with 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden until May 2011 when bin Laden was killed. Agents caught up with Bulger in June 2011, living in a seaside Santa Monica, California apartment.

The jury convicted him of all but one of 32 criminal counts.

"Thirty-one out of thirty-two counts in such a complicated case covering such a long period of time is a fabulous result for the government," said Michael Kendall, a former federal prosecutor in Boston who is now with the law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery. "He's going to go to jail for the rest of his life."

NEVER EXPECTED FREEDOM

Defense attorney J.W. Carney told reporters afterward that his client was pleased by the outcome, and noted that Bulger had avoided the death penalty. That would have been a possibility if he had been tried on state charges in Oklahoma or Florida, where two of the murders were committed.

"This trial has never been about Jim Bulger being set free," he said. Carney said that from the moment FBI officials arrested Bulger, his client knew "he was going to die behind the walls of a prison or on a gurney, getting injected with a chemical that would kill him."

Bulger's lawyers, who on the first day admitted their client was a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark and later described him as an "organized criminal", mounted an atypical defense, rarely directly addressing many of the charges.

Most of their efforts focused on denying prosecutors' assertion that Bulger had served as an FBI informant, or "rat," for more than a decade. On Monday, Carney called that assertion a "myth."

Carney said he planned to appeal the conviction, citing a claim by Bulger that he had a deal with federal prosecutors that gave him immunity for his crimes. Carney said he would appeal on those grounds, but he did not discuss a reason Bulger would have been given an immunity deal.

He reiterated his earlier assertion that Bulger had never been an informant. Bulger has contended that he paid a corrupt FBI agent for tips but provided none of his own.

Before the trial began, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper had told Carney that he could not argue immunity, saying no deal that allowed a person to commit murder without consequence would be legally valid.

Bulger declined to take the stand during the trial and told the court earlier this month, "As far as I'm concerned ... this is a sham and do what you want with me."

ELEVEN MURDERS

The jury found Bulger guilty of 11 of the 19 murder charges. They decided prosecutors had failed to prove their case in murders that dated back to a 1970s turf war with another organization, the Notorangeli gang. The victims included members of that gang and people who were killed by accident in botched hits who had nothing to do with the gangs.

The jury reached no finding in the death of one woman, Debra Davis, a girlfriend of Bulger associate Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi. Flemmi testified at the trial that Bulger strangled Davis in a South Boston house after she learned of their dealings with the FBI. Other witnesses had testified that Flemmi actually killed Davis with Bulger present.

The murders were part of a racketeering count that was the most complicated jurors had to decide. They needed to find he committed just two of the 38 crimes contained in that count for their guilty verdict.

Relatives of Bulger's victims, who had been a constant presence at the waterfront courthouse during the trial, poured out onto the street after the verdict to tell their stories.

Steve Davis said he was at peace with the jury not reaching a finding on the murder of his sister, Debra.

"I don't feel that he hands-on himself killed my sister, but I do know that he was guilty of conspiring or taking part of the whole thing," Davis said. "But a no-find is better than a not guilty."

William O'Brien was angry after the jury found that the government had not proven its case in his father's 1973 murder.

"That prosecution dropped the ball," said O'Brien, who shares his father's name. "Five minutes they spent talking about his murder. That jury should be ashamed of themselves."

The jury found Bulger not guilty of only one criminal count of extortion.

The government's case relied heavily on three former top associates of Bulger including Flemmi, John "The Executioner" Martorano, and Kevin Weeks, who detailed 19 murders the gang committed.

Carney said that Bulger was glad to have his story told at trial. "At the end of a person's life, when people think he is the only bad person in the courtroom, it's important to show that that's not true," he said.



headline: Abducted California girl didn't know mother and brother were dead

old California girl rescued in the Idaho wilderness after her suspected kidnapper was shot dead by the FBI was unaware until she was freed that her mother and brother had been killed a week earlier, the San Diego County sheriff said.

Hannah Anderson, who was left badly shaken by her ordeal, was informed while being debriefed by authorities after her rescue on Saturday that her mother, Christina Anderson, 44, and her 8-year-old brother, Ethan, had been killed by her alleged kidnapper, Sheriff Bill Gore said.

Addressing an afternoon news conference after the teenager had been reunited with relatives in California, Gore sought to dispel any notion that she might have willingly accompanied the suspect, James Lee DiMaggio, 40, a longtime, close friend of the Andersons.

"It became very clear to us that she is a victim in every sense of the word of this horrific crime," Gore said. "She was under extreme, extreme duress."

The girl's father, Brett Anderson, who has lived apart from his family in Tennessee, thanked law enforcement officials, the media and members of the public for their role in bringing his daughter home safely.

"The healing process will be slow. She has been through a tremendous ordeal, and I'm very proud of her," Anderson said.

Authorities have not publicly discussed any possible motives for DiMaggio's actions. But a family friend has said that the suspect developed an apparent infatuation with the high school girl that made Hannah feel uncomfortable.

Gore also revealed that Hannah had told authorities that DiMaggio was armed with a rifle and fired at least one round before being shot to death by an FBI agent in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness on Saturday.

He said further details of the deadly lakeside confrontation between DiMaggio and federal agents in the Idaho back country, about 90 miles northeast of Boise, would be withheld until the FBI completes its own review of the shooting.

Before she disappeared, Hannah, her brother and their mother were last seen on August 3. The following night, the mother, Ethan and a dog were found dead in the burned-out ruins of DiMaggio's cabin-style home in the rural community of Boulevard, California, about 45 miles east of San Diego.

AMBER ALERTS

Authorities suspect DiMaggio, an information technology specialist, set his house on fire before vanishing with Hannah, but they have not said how the two murder victims were killed.

It took medical examiners several days to positively identify the boy's remains, and authorities initially issued child-abduction Amber Alerts for both children in California, Oregon, Washington state, Nevada and Idaho as they pressed their search for DiMaggio.

The notice in California late on August 5 marked the first time such a message was disseminated to private cell phones and mobile devices statewide through a new Wireless Emergency Alert system administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Introduced by the same harsh electronic tone that precedes the broadcast of FEMA emergency radio tests, the August 5 alert startled many Californians, some of whom were awakened just before 11 p.m. to a smartphone alarm they had never experienced.

A break in the case came days later after a group returning from a horseback ride through the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho told police that they had spotted DiMaggio and the girl backpacking there on Wednesday.

Investigators converging on the area found DiMaggio's car on Friday, and the following day U.S. marshals in a helicopter spotted the fugitive at a campsite, leading to his confrontation with FBI agents on the ground.

Sheriff's deputies said evidence gathered at the scene and from telephone and credit card records suggested that DiMaggio had been planning the abduction for weeks. For example, they said, he purchased camping gear several weeks earlier. They also warned the public that it appeared DiMaggio had built bombs or incendiary devices that he might rig to his car or hideout.

Authorities later said no booby-traps were found on his car.

Gore said a gray cat DiMaggio was seen holding when he was spotted by horseback riders in the woods was his own pet. The cat was ultimately recovered alive by the FBI.

Brett Anderson has said he was baffled by the actions of DiMaggio, whom he described as a trusted longtime friend considered an uncle by the children. A law enforcement source said DiMaggio served as the best man at Brett and Christina Anderson's wedding.



headline: Russian pleads not guilty in biggest U.S. hacking case

8:31am EDT

A Russian man accused of being part of the largest cybercrime ring ever prosecuted in the United States pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that could send him to prison for decades.

Dmitriy Smilianets, 29, of Moscow, entered the plea during an afternoon hearing in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.

His attorney told Reuters that he would fight the charges and that he was looking into possible irregularities with the circumstances of his arrest last year in the Netherlands.

Smilianets wore an orange prison jumpsuit and stood with shackled hands and feet during the appearance with lawyer Bruce Provda before U.S. District Judge Jerome Simandle.

Smilianets is accused of conspiring with a team of hackers from Russia and the Ukraine to steal more than 160 million credit card numbers in a series of breaches that cost victim companies more than $300 million.

The companies infiltrated included financial firms such as NASDAQ and Heartland Payment Systems Inc, along with other well-known names including JetBlue Airways Corp and retailer J.C. Penney Co of Plano, Texas.

Prosecutors allege Smilianets sold the stolen data after it was taken by four other members of his team, including credit card data starting at $10 for an American number and $50 for a European number.

Smilianets was extradited to the United States in September 2012 and has remained in federal custody since. In Russia, he was most widely known as the founder of a championship electronic gaming team called Moscow 5, which traveled the world for competitions. Online, his handles included Dima Brave and Dima Bold.

If convicted, he faces up to 30 years for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, another 30 years for wire fraud and five years each for gaining unauthorized access to computers and conspiracy to gain access.

Also arrested in the Netherlands was Vladimir Drinkman, who remains there fighting extradition. Amid a general worsening of relations with Russia exacerbated by intelligence agency leaker Edward Snowden's flight there, prosecutors last month also unsealed an indictment against another alleged member of the ring still free in that country, Alexandr Kalinin.

YEARS-LONG PURSUIT

Authorities have been pursuing the hackers for years. Many of the breaches were previously reported, though it appeared the one involving Nasdaq OMX Group Inc was disclosed for the first time in July.

Prosecutors said each of the defendants had specialized tasks: Drinkman and Alexandr Kalinin hacked into networks, while Roman Kotov, 32, mined them for data. They allegedly hid their activities using anonymous web-hosting services provided by Mikhail Rytikov, 26, of Ukraine.

Rytikov has not been arrested, but an attorney for him, Arkady Bukh, attended Monday's hearing. Bukh said his client did not know Smilianets.

According to prosecutors, the five men hid their efforts by disabling victims' anti-virus software and storing data on multiple hacking platforms, prosecutors said. They sold payment card numbers to resellers, who then resold them on online forums or to "cashers" who encode the numbers onto blank plastic cards.

The indictment cited Albert Gonzalez as a co-conspirator. Gonzalez is already serving 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to helping mastermind one of the schemes.

Prosecutors say the defendants worked with Gonzalez before his arrest in Miami, then continued on a crime spree after his capture.

Kalinin and Drinkman were previously charged in New Jersey as "Hacker 1" and "Hacker 2" in a 2009 indictment charging Gonzalez in connection with five breaches.

The NASDAQ breach did not include the trading platform that allows NASDAQ customers to buy and sell securities, prosecutors said. Officials with NASDAQ declined to comment.

An official briefed on that incident said the group wasn't able to get any money from their NASDAQ access.

Other victims included Dow Jones, Wet Seal Inc and 7-Eleven Inc, according to prosecutors.

Dow Jones said in a statement that there was "no evidence" that information of Dow Jones or Wall Street Journal customers information was compromised as a result of the breaches.

headline: New York State sues Internet lender over 'exorbitant' loan rates
byline: By Karen Freifeld
8:31am EDT

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued an online lender on Monday that he accused of "scamming" consumers with interest rates so high that a borrower could eventually shell out more than $4,900 to repay a $1,000 loan.

The company, Western Sky Financial LLC, claims ties to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and immunity from state and federal law.

Schneiderman, in a lawsuit filed in New York State court in Manhattan, accused the company of charging interest rates of as much as 355 percent to New Yorkers who took out personal loans.

New York law prohibits most non-bank lenders not licensed by the state from charging more than 16 percent interest on small, unsecured loans.

Other states also have sued Western Sky Financial.

Western Sky, which targeted New Yorkers through television and Internet advertising, is the lender in name only, according to the lawsuit. CashCall Inc and its affiliate WS Funding LLC offer and arrange for the loans, it said.

"Western Sky and CashCall charged exorbitant interest rates on their loans to scam New Yorkers out of millions of dollars," Schneiderman said in a statement.

The company made some 18,000 high-interest loans to New Yorkers since 2010, with principal amounts ranging from $400 to $9,925, according to the lawsuit.

A $1,000 loan can cost as much as $4,942 in finance charges, fees and principal over two years, the lawsuit said.

Western Sky said in a statement that the allegations are "without merit" and that it would vigorously defend itself.

It stopped lending to New York residents in March, it said, while the legal issues are outstanding.

Western Sky said it is owned by a tribal member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and operates within the exterior boundaries of the reservation.

New York attorney Katya Jestin, who represents the company and its owner, Martin Webb, who also is a defendant, said Western Sky "enjoys tribal immunity and is not subject jurisdiction by the state of New York."

California-based Cash Call Inc, and its affiliate WS Funding LLC, and CashCall owner John Paul Reddam, also are defendants in the lawsuit. Efforts to reach them were unsuccessful.

The lawsuit seeks to stop the companies and their owners from engaging in further illegal lending, cancellation of existing loans, restitution of excess payments, illegal profits and monetary penalties.

Separately, on August 5, the New York Department of Financial Services sent letters to 35 lenders, including Western Sky Financial, directing them to stop lending monies at usurious rates in New York.

The case is People of the State of New York v. Western Sky Financial, et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451370/2013.

headline: Family says Georgia boy ruled out as heart transplant candidate
byline: By David Beasley
8:31am EDT

old Atlanta boy who could have less than six months to live said Monday he is being unfairly denied a heart transplant because of past failure to take medicine and appear for doctor's appointments.

Melencia Hamilton, mother of Anthony Stokes, said her son, who has an enlarged heart, was told by Children's Healthcare of Atlanta hospital he would not be placed on the transplant list because of fear he would not comply with medical requirements.

"They said they don't have any evidence that he would take his medicine or that he would go to his follow-ups," Hamilton told the Atlanta television station WSB.

The hospital did not give details but said in a statement, "We follow very specific criteria in determining eligibility for a transplant of any kind."

"The well-being of our patients is always our first priority. We are continuing to work with this family and looking at all options regarding this patient's health care," the statement added.

A hospital spokesperson declined to discuss the case.

Family members did not respond to phone calls seeking comment about Stokes' record of following medical prescriptions.

Heart transplant patients can become seriously ill, and even die, if they miss even one day of medication, Mariell Jessup, president of the American Heart Association, said.

"It is something transplant centers take very seriously," she said. "You have to follow a very strict regimen. Hearts are very scarce resources."

Hospitals consider a variety of factors, besides medical necessity, in deciding whether to put a patient on a transplant waiting list, said Joel Newman, a spokesman for the non-profit group, United Network For Organ Sharing.

"There are psycho-social considerations: Does the patient understand the risk, are they likely to follow medication schedules, can they keep up with appointments, can they come to the clinic for regular follow ups?," he said.

"It's a very individual process," he said, adding that a patient might be placed on the waiting list by one transplant center but denied at another with different criteria.

headline: California billionaire lifts lid on 'Hyperloop' futuristic transport
byline: By Rory Carroll
8:31am EDT

Billionaire U.S. entrepreneur Elon Musk unveiled plans on Monday for a futuristic "Hyperloop" transportation system to whisk passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles in under half an hour.

The highly anticipated announcement put to rest some of the questions surrounding the ambitious project, which the Tesla Motors Inc founder and CEO has hinted at for months but declined to discuss in detail.

Musk said the Hyperloop would cost less than $6 billion in total and could transport 7.4 million people each way each year.

He said it would take 7-10 years for the project to be completed.

The solar-powered system, which Musk previously described as a cross between a Concorde, rail gun and air-hockey table, would shoot as many as 28 passengers in each enclosed capsule through a low-pressure steel tube at up to 800 miles per hour, according to the 57-page design plan.

Musk, who made his name as a PayPal founding member before going on to start SpaceX and Tesla, envisions capsules departing every 30 seconds and traversing the roughly 400 miles between Los Angeles and San Francisco - the busiest traffic corridor on the West Coast - along an elevated tube erected along the I-5 interstate highway.

The capsules ride a cushion of air blasted from "skis" beneath, propelled via a magnetic linear accelerator.

Major questions remain, notably whether the California state government will ever approve the massive project, and whether any private companies are willing to step in and build it. The design remains theoretical and has yet to be tested in the field.

Musk has said he is too busy running electric car company Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX to build the Hyperloop himself. He said the design plans were open-source, meaning others can build on them.

LIFT-OFF

On Monday, however, he told reporters on a conference call he could kick off the project.

"I've come around a little bit on my thinking here," he said.

"Maybe I could do the beginning bit... and then hand it over to somebody else," he said.

He said he would be willing to put some of his personal fortune toward the project but stressed that building the Hyperloop was a low priority for him as he continues to focus primarily on SpaceX and Tesla.

He also asked the public for help improving the design. Corporations have resorted in the past to public assistance on their products. In 2009, Netflix Inc awarded a cash prize to a team that succeeded in improving by 10 percent the accuracy of its system for movie recommendations.

Musk is floating the Hyperloop as an alternative to the state's planned high-speed train line, which he has said will be both too expensive to build and too slow.

Cost estimates for construction of the train line, a major priority of California Governor Jerry Brown's, have ballooned to $68 billion, far more than what Musk believes it will cost to build the Hyperloop.

The Hyperloop would be safer, faster, less expensive and more convenient, Musk said in a blog post.

The expected half-hour travel time for Hyperloop passengers compares with current travel times of an hour and 15 minutes by plane, about 5 and a half hours by car, as well as about 2 hours and 40 minutes via California's planned high-speed rail.



headline: 'Hell broke loose,' witness says of Fort Hood massacre
byline: By Eric M. Johnson and Lisa Maria Garza
8:31am EDT

martial of Major Nidal Hasan for the 2009 shooting spree that killed 13 and wounded more than 30 at Fort Hood, Texas, on Monday described carnage and confusion usually reserved for live combat.

Hasan, 42, has admitted to shooting his fellow soldiers, saying he switched sides in what he called a U.S. war on Islam, and he could face the death penalty if convicted.

"I could hear people screaming, brass hitting the ground. I could smell the smoke," testified retired Lieutenant Colonel Randy Royer, a major at the time who was shot in the leg and arm.

"I could see all the blood, the crumpled uniforms ... shell casings. It was just carnage," added Royer, who used a cane to steady himself in court.

More than Sixty witnesses have taken the stand to describe the attack inside a medical facility at Fort Hood on November 5, 2009, days before Hasan, an Army psychiatrist and U.S.-born Muslim, was due to be deployed to Afghanistan.

"Hell broke loose," said Staff Sergeant Christopher Burgess, who described gunfire following him every time he and a group of people moved, trying to escape the building.

Many of the witness have said they at first believed the shooting was a training exercise because soldiers are normally prohibited from carrying weapons on base.

Several quoted Hasan screaming "Allahu akbar" ("God is greatest" in Arabic) as he sprayed gunfire with his laser-sighted handgun. Fort Hood police eventually shot Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down and attends court in a wheelchair.

Shemeka Hairston, a nurse, said she heard what sounded like firecrackers and saw a cloud of smoke. She called the 911 emergency line, and an operator advised her to "stay low."

"It sounded like the gunfire was getting closer," said Hairston, who wept on the stand and wiped tears away with a tissue and could be heard wailing upon leaving the courtroom.

CHILLING EVENTS

As audio of Hairston's 911 call played, Hasan stared ahead at the screen displaying the transcript of the call, showing no emotion on his face. Hasan, who acts as his own lawyer, refrained from cross-examining any witnesses.

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges against Hasan. A review by a former FBI director found Hasan had exchanged emails with Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing. Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.

The Military judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, granted the 13-member panel, comprising nine colonels, three lieutenant colonels and a major, more time between witnesses to jot notes.

The panel, which must unanimously find Hasan guilty of premeditated murder for him to be sentenced to death, never questioned the witnesses. The U.S. military has not executed a service member since 1961.

The court-martial is expected to turn on Tuesday to expert witnesses, some of whom will testify on autopsy reports, medical treatment and bullet trajectories, among other elements of the shooting.

One by one, witnesses on Monday relived the chilling events of the early afternoon rampage at the Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, the largest Army installation in the United States.

"My arteries were blowing blood all over the place," said Mick Engnehl, a former private first class, who was unable to raise his right arm to be sworn in, the result of being shot twice in the neck and shoulder.

Another witness, Christopher Royal, a Chief Warrant Officer at the time, said he fled the building and took cover behind an SUV, although Hasan at one point continued to come down toward him spraying bullets.

Royal, whose pregnant wife sat only a few feet from Hasan in the small, wood-paneled courtroom, her eyes locked on her husband, said he wanted to disrupt the shooter by charging him but slipped in blood. He also saw Hasan release an empty magazine and reach down into his cargo pocket and reload.

"He was prepared," Royal added.



headline: Arizona 'temple murders' retrial opens with jury selection
byline: By David Schwartz
8:31am EDT

Jury selection began on Monday in the retrial of an Arizona man convicted of shooting to death six monks and three others at a Thai Buddhist temple west of Phoenix in 1991.

Thailand-born Johnathan Doody, 39, was convicted in 1994 of the execution style killings, but a U.S. appeals court threw out the conviction, saying it was based on a coerced confession.

The grisly shootings at Wat Promkunaram temple, which became known as the "temple murders," brought international media attention to Arizona and focused a glaring spotlight on police tactics used to solicit confessions.

"This was just a horrific crime," said Gary Stuart, a veteran attorney who wrote a book about the murders. "The people who were killed refused to resist and participated peacefully in their own execution - it still boggles the mind when I think about it."

On August 10, 1991, investigators found the bodies of six monks, a novice, a nun and a temple boy face down in a circle, each killed by a gunshot to the head, according to court records. Their living areas were ransacked and personal property stolen.

Doody, then aged 17 and a high school friend, Alessandro "Alex" Garcia, then 16, came under suspicion after police identified a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle as the murder weapon. The gun, which belonged to a friend of the two suspects, was recovered during an unrelated vehicle search.

Doody was brought in for questioning in October 1991 and admitted his involvement after 12 hours of interrogation. Garcia identified Doody as the "mastermind" of the plan to rob the temple, and said Doody had fired the fatal shots.

At trial in 1994, Doody was convicted and sentenced to 281 years in prison, while Garcia received 271 years for the murders and an unrelated homicide.

The conviction was tossed by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in May 2011, on the grounds that sheriff's investigators violated his rights and coerced a confession. The court ordered a retrial at the Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix.

Prosecutors retrying the case face a tough test convicting Doody without the confession that helped send him to prison and with little or no physical evidence linking him to the crime, several attorneys said.

The case could hinge on the testimony of Garcia, who testified against Doody in the original trial in exchange for avoiding the death penalty, attorneys said.

"We do not believe that the state can prove Johnathan Doody participated in the temple murders," Doody's attorney, Marie Schaffer, said. "The state will not prove he was at the temple at the time of the murders."

A spokesman for prosecutors declined comment.



headline: Missouri bans rodeo clown who wore Obama mask from state fairs
byline: By Kevin Murphy
8:31am EDT

A clown who wore a mask of President Barack Obama at a Missouri State Fair rodeo and encouraged a bull to run him down as the crowd cheered was banned Monday from any future state fairs.

The incident Saturday night was denounced by leading Democrats and Republicans and fair officials as disrespectful to the president.

The Missouri State Fair Commission voted Monday to "permanently ban this rodeo clown from ever participating or performing" at the annual state fair, according to a news release.

"The Missouri State Fair apologizes for the unconscionable stunt," the commission said.

The commission did not identify the clown in its statement, and officials could not be reached for further comment.

The clown appeared at the finals of the Missouri Rodeo Cowboys Association rodeo at the fair in Sedalia, Missouri, about 94 miles southwest of Kansas City. A Facebook account of the clown's stunt appeared on the website of Show Me Progress, which identifies itself as a "progressive politics community" for Missouri, from a person who reported attending the fair with a student from Taiwan.

"The announcer wanted to know if anyone would like to see Obama run down by a bull," the posting said. "The crowd went wild. He asked it again and again, louder each time, whipping the audience into a lather."

On Monday, Albert Watkins, a lawyer for the main announcer at the rodeo, said that the unidentified clown who wore the Obama mask made most of the remarks himself into a microphone he was wearing. Rodeo clowns use their own microphones and choose their own mask and routine, Watkins said.

Watkins said his client Mark Ficken, who was the main announcer and is fair association president and superintendent of schools in Boonville, Missouri, has been unduly faulted in the incident.

The only remark Ficken made as announcer was a standard warning to clowns to be careful, in this case saying, "Watch out for that bull, Obama," Watkins said.

Watkins said the rest of the Show Me Progress posting describing the event was accurate.

"A clown wearing a political mask is not unusual," Watkins said. "What was unusual was that what started out as funny became off-color, inappropriate and political in nature, if not out-and-out racist. There is no place for that at a state fair."

The Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association posted a "sincere apology for the inappropriate act during the bull-riding show" at the fair.

"The sport of rodeo is not meant to be a political platform," the association stated. The board is "dealing with the situation firmly and quickly and this type of behavior will not be tolerated," it said.

The fair commission said the terms of its contract with the rodeo association to conduct rodeos is under review to decide if any further action is warranted.



headline: 'Whitey' Bulger guilty of 11 murders in sweeping Boston mob case
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

James "Whitey" Bulger, a brutal gangster who ruled over Boston's criminal underworld in the 1970s and '80s and evaded capture for 16 years, was found guilty of murder and racketeering by a jury on Monday and will likely spend the rest of his life in prison.

The 83-year-old Bulger, dressed in a gray shirt, dark pants and white sneakers, stood quietly as the verdict was read, showing little emotional response to the decision by jurors to convict him after five days of deliberation in Boston federal court. His sentencing was scheduled for November 13.

A legendary figure in Boston's underworld, Bulger ran the "Winter Hill" crime gang after coming to power in a mob war that resulted in the death of members of rival gangs. He cemented his grip on Boston's crime scene through ties with corrupt Federal Bureau of Investigation officials who shared his Irish ethnicity and turned a blind eye to his crimes in exchange for information they could use against the Italian Mafia.

During the two month-long trial, the 12 jurors heard vivid descriptions of Bulger's crimes. They included brazen daylight shootings of fellow criminals, the terrifying extortion of a victim at whose crotch Bulger aimed a machine gun and how one associate would pull teeth from the mouths of dead victims, hoping to make the bodies harder to identify.

Nicknamed "Whitey" because of the shock of light-colored hair he had as a young man, Bulger fled Boston in 1994 after a tip from a corrupt agent that his arrest was imminent.

He spent 16 years on the run, many of them on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted" list along with 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden until May 2011 when bin Laden was killed. Agents caught up with Bulger in June 2011, living in a seaside Santa Monica, California apartment.

The jury convicted him of all but one of 32 criminal counts.

"Thirty-one out of thirty-two counts in such a complicated case covering such a long period of time is a fabulous result for the government," said Michael Kendall, a former federal prosecutor in Boston who is now with the law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery. "He's going to go to jail for the rest of his life."

NEVER EXPECTED FREEDOM

Defense attorney J.W. Carney told reporters afterward that his client was pleased by the outcome, and noted that Bulger had avoided the death penalty. That would have been a possibility if he had been tried on state charges in Oklahoma or Florida, where two of the murders were committed.

"This trial has never been about Jim Bulger being set free," he said. Carney said that from the moment FBI officials arrested Bulger, his client knew "he was going to die behind the walls of a prison or on a gurney, getting injected with a chemical that would kill him."

Bulger's lawyers, who on the first day admitted their client was a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark and later described him as an "organized criminal", mounted an atypical defense, rarely directly addressing many of the charges.

Most of their efforts focused on denying prosecutors' assertion that Bulger had served as an FBI informant, or "rat," for more than a decade. On Monday, Carney called that assertion a "myth."

Carney said he planned to appeal the conviction, citing a claim by Bulger that he had a deal with federal prosecutors that gave him immunity for his crimes. Carney said he would appeal on those grounds, but he did not discuss a reason Bulger would have been given an immunity deal.

He reiterated his earlier assertion that Bulger had never been an informant. Bulger has contended that he paid a corrupt FBI agent for tips but provided none of his own.

Before the trial began, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper had told Carney that he could not argue immunity, saying no deal that allowed a person to commit murder without consequence would be legally valid.

Bulger declined to take the stand during the trial and told the court earlier this month, "As far as I'm concerned ... this is a sham and do what you want with me."

ELEVEN MURDERS

The jury found Bulger guilty of 11 of the 19 murder charges. They decided prosecutors had failed to prove their case in murders that dated back to a 1970s turf war with another organization, the Notorangeli gang. The victims included members of that gang and people who were killed by accident in botched hits who had nothing to do with the gangs.

The jury reached no finding in the death of one woman, Debra Davis, a girlfriend of Bulger associate Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi. Flemmi testified at the trial that Bulger strangled Davis in a South Boston house after she learned of their dealings with the FBI. Other witnesses had testified that Flemmi actually killed Davis with Bulger present.

The murders were part of a racketeering count that was the most complicated jurors had to decide. They needed to find he committed just two of the 38 crimes contained in that count for their guilty verdict.

Relatives of Bulger's victims, who had been a constant presence at the waterfront courthouse during the trial, poured out onto the street after the verdict to tell their stories.

Steve Davis said he was at peace with the jury not reaching a finding on the murder of his sister, Debra.

"I don't feel that he hands-on himself killed my sister, but I do know that he was guilty of conspiring or taking part of the whole thing," Davis said. "But a no-find is better than a not guilty."

William O'Brien was angry after the jury found that the government had not proven its case in his father's 1973 murder.

"That prosecution dropped the ball," said O'Brien, who shares his father's name. "Five minutes they spent talking about his murder. That jury should be ashamed of themselves."

The jury found Bulger not guilty of only one criminal count of extortion.

The government's case relied heavily on three former top associates of Bulger including Flemmi, John "The Executioner" Martorano, and Kevin Weeks, who detailed 19 murders the gang committed.

Carney said that Bulger was glad to have his story told at trial. "At the end of a person's life, when people think he is the only bad person in the courtroom, it's important to show that that's not true," he said.



headline: U.S. moves to curb long, mandatory drug sentences
byline: By Dan Levine and David Ingram
8:31am EDT

The Obama administration unveiled steps on Monday to fix what it considers the longstanding unjust treatment of many nonviolent drug offenders, aiming to bypass tough mandatory prison terms while reducing America's huge prison population and saving billions of dollars.

"Too many Americans go to too many prisons for far too long, and for no truly good law enforcement reason," Attorney General Eric Holder, the top U.S. law enforcement official, said in a speech in San Francisco unveiling the proposals.

Holder said the Justice Department would direct federal prosecutors to charge defendants in certain low-level drug cases in such a way that they would not be eligible for mandatory sentences now on the books.

Prosecutors would do this by omitting from official charging documents the amount of drugs involved in a case, lawyers with expertise in criminal law said. By doing so, prosecutors would ensure that nonviolent defendants without significant criminal history would not get long sentences.

Other proposals unveiled by Holder - such as giving federal judges the leeway to depart from mandatory minimum sentences for some drug offenses - require congressional approval, a tricky prospect at a time of partisan gridlock in Washington.

Holder labeled as an injustice the mandatory minimum sentences required under the criminal justice system in many drugs cases - condemning offenders to long prison terms even for nonviolent crimes and possession of small amounts of drugs.

"This is why I have today mandated a modification of the Justice Department's charging policies so that certain low-level, nonviolent drug offenders who have no ties to large-scale organizations, gangs or cartels will no longer be charged with offenses that impose draconian mandatory minimum sentences," Holder said.

Holder cited a moral imperative - as well as financial and social reasons - to re-examine policies that send so many Americans to prison.

"As the so-called war on drugs enters its fifth decade, we need to ask whether it, and the approaches that comprise it, have been truly effective," Holder said at a conference of the American Bar Association lawyers group.

WORLD INCARCERATION LEADER

The United States leads the world in the percentage of its population behind bars, according to the International Centre for Prison Studies in London. Among the reasons for that are the mandatory minimum sentences and related laws enacted in the 1980s and 1990s at a time of rising crime and drug violence.

Holder said that the United States accounts for just 5 percent of the world's population, but incarcerates almost a quarter of the world's prisoners. He added that U.S. federal prisons are nearly 40 percent above capacity and that almost half of the inmates are serving time for drug-related crimes.

American political leaders including Republican President Ronald Reagan and Democratic President Bill Clinton championed big spending increases to target criminal gangs and drug traffickers in what has been called the "war on drugs."

Crime has dropped in the United States since those laws were passed. Democratic President Barack Obama's administration is betting that support for mandatory minimum laws has eroded for several reasons, including the amount of money spent by governments on housing and maintaining a huge prison population.

Another step being taken by Holder's department would loosen the criteria for releasing inmates who have serious medical conditions or who are elderly - as long as they are nonviolent and have served significant portions of their sentences.

Holder also said he has instructed federal prosecutors nationwide to develop "specific, locally tailored guidelines" to determine if drug cases should be subject to federal charges.

It was not clear how many offenders might see shorter prison terms under the administration's proposals. The proposals were unlikely to affect many people already imprisoned.

CONGRESSIONAL REACTION MIXED

Democratic lawmakers responded favorably to Holder's speech, agreeing that mandatory minimum sentences had become unfair. Some Republicans said Holder went too far.

"If Attorney General Holder wants to reform our criminal justice system, he should work with Congress to do so," U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, said in a statement.

In a development that Holder called "very promising," Republican Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah - favorites of the conservative Tea Party movement - have joined leading Democrats to call for passage of legislation to enable federal judges to depart from mandatory minimum sentences for some drug offenses.

"Such legislation will ultimately save our country billions of dollars, and the president and I look forward to working with members of both parties to refine and advance these proposals," Holder said.

For some drug offenses, U.S. law mandates that judges impose a minimum sentence. For some other offenses, judges get an advisory range from the U.S. Sentencing Commission.

Prosecutors can avoid both constraints at the outset of a criminal case when they make the crucial decisions about if and how to charge a suspect.

"By reserving the most severe penalties for serious, high-level or violent drug traffickers, we can better promote public safety, deterrence and rehabilitation, while making our expenditures smarter and more productive," Holder said.

The Justice Department staff has been studying changes since the beginning of the year, about the time Holder agreed to stay in his job into Obama's second, four-year term, officials said.

According to statistics kept by the International Centre for Prison Studies, 716 of every 100,000 Americans are in prison or in jail awaiting trial. That compares to 479 in Russia, 284 in Iran, 274 in Brazil, 209 in Mexico, 149 in England and Wales, 121 in China, 114 in Canada, 102 in France and 80 in Germany.

There was little indication that the administration's proposals would affect private-sector companies that help to manage U.S. prisons. The companies specialize in housing inmates who faced immigration and customs charges, not drug charges, said Kevin McVeigh, an analyst with Macquarie Securities.

fighting tactic was unconstitutional, dealing a stinging rebuke to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who vowed to appeal the ruling.

U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin called it "indirect racial profiling" because it targeted racially defined groups, resulting in the disproportionate and discriminatory stopping of tens of thousands of blacks and Hispanics while the city's highest officials "turned a blind eye," she said.

"No one should live in fear of being stopped whenever he leaves his home to go about the activities of daily life," Scheindlin wrote in her opinion.

But Bloomberg stood his ground. "People also have a right to walk down the street without being killed or mugged," he said at a news conference, repeating his conviction that the program resulted in a drastic reduction in crime that made New York the "poster child" for safe U.S. cities.

Political pundits said the ruling would tarnish Bloomberg's legacy and may trip up NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who President Barack Obama has indicated may be a possible nominee for U.S. secretary of homeland security.

"It will be a heavy lift to designate someone who's been excoriated by a federal judge for civil rights violations," said Eugene O'Donnell, a former police officer and prosecutor who is a professor at New York's John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

As part of her ruling, Scheindlin ordered the appointment of an independent monitor and other immediate changes to police policies. Her "remedies" address two lawsuits, one brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) and the other by the Center for Constitutional Rights.

Several black and Hispanic men named as plaintiffs gathered at a CCR press conference, some choking back tears as they cheered the ruling for exposing racial profiling by U.S. authorities.

"When I got the call this morning the first thing I did was cry," said David Ourlicht, 25, who was stopped at St. John's University in Queens in 2008, ostensibly for walking in a suspicious way with a bulge under his winter clothing.

"It's a really good picture of what's going on in society," said Ourlicht, who is a mixed race man of black and white heritage.

Bloomberg told reporters his administration will appeal the ruling. That will take place as soon as the monitor makes any kind of request, at which time the city will seek an immediate stay pending the outcome of the appeal, said Corporation Counsel Michael Cardozo.

Bloomberg has resisted interference in his police policies, especially that of stopping, questioning and frisking anyone for "reasonable suspicion" in high-crime areas. An added benefit, he said at the press conference, was "the possibility of being stopped acts as a vital deterrent."

The mayor has sought to preserve a legacy that includes a 30 percent reduction in violent crime since 2001, the year he was first elected. Bloomberg will leave office on January 1 after 12 years in office.

All four leading candidates in next month's Democratic mayoral primary have taken a stand against "stop and frisk," but none of them has said they would abolish the police practice.

The judge, who presided over the nine-week trial without a jury, ruled that the effectiveness of "stop and frisk" was irrelevant.

"Many police practices may be useful for fighting crime -preventive detention or coerced confessions, for example - but because they are unconstitutional, they cannot be used, no matter how effective," the ruling said.

Scheindlin's ruling was not surprising. She has almost single-handedly overseen lawsuits against the NYPD's stop and frisk program after being randomly selected to preside over a lawsuit following the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black man, by the NYPD's now-disbanded Street Crime Unit. Police Commissioner Kelly has complained that Scheindlin favors civil liberties groups.

In her ruling, Scheindlin said police officers felt pressure to increase the number of stops after Bloomberg took office in January 2002 and brought in Kelly as police commissioner.

As a result, officers often frisked young minority men for weapons or searched their pockets for contraband before letting them go, in a violation of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment that protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, the judge said in her 195-page decision.

The judge selected as the monitor Peter Zimroth, 70, who once worked as the city's top lawyer from 1987 to 1989.

The judge also ordered the NYPD to adopt a written policy specifying circumstances where stops are authorized; adopt a trial program requiring the use of body-worn cameras in one precinct in each of the city's five boroughs; and to set up a community-based remedial process under a court-appointed facilitator.



headline: U.S. judge hands four-year sentences to men in Taliban drug sting
byline: By Nate Raymond
8:31am EDT

Two men on Monday were sentenced to more than four years in prison for conspiring to help smuggle drugs into the United States on behalf of people they believed were part of the Taliban.

Martin Raouf Bouraima, 42, and Corneille Dato, 56, were among a group of seven men indicted in 2011 following an undercover investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration targeting drug trafficking out of West Africa.

At a hearing in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald sentenced them to 50 months each in prison.

The men have been imprisoned since their arrest in Monrovia, Liberia, in February 2011. That means each has about 20 more months to serve.

Buchwald acknowledged the "limited role and relative culpability of the defendants in comparison to other defendants in the conspiracy."

But she said she was concerned that the two were aware they were giving aid to people they thought were involved with the Taliban in Afghanistan.

The case stemmed from a probe starting in 2010 in which two DEA informants posed as Taliban representatives to discuss with the men a deal involving hundreds of kilograms of cocaine and heroin.

Prosecutors say that in meetings with the confidential sources in Benin and Ghana, Bouraima and Dato along with two other men agreed to take in shipments of Taliban-owned heroin from Benin and transport them to Ghana.

They understood that some of the heroin would then be flown to the United States, prosecutors said.

A DEA source later told Bouraima and Dato that the U.S. drug proceeds would be transferred back to West Africa, where the money would be used to buy weapons for the Taliban, prosecutors said.

Bouraima and Dato, both of Benin, pleaded guilty in November 2012 and January 2013, respectively, to charges of conspiracy to import heroin and cocaine.

Another conspirator, Francis Sourou Ahissou, 48, was sentenced Wednesday to 5-1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty in May.

Two others, Alwar Pouryan, 39, and Oded Orbach, 55, are scheduled to be sentenced next month after Buchwald in a non-jury trial found them guilty of agreeing to sell weapons to people they thought were involved with the Taliban.

While convicted in connection with a purported Taliban conspiracy, neither Bouraima nor Dato appears to be Islamist. Their lawyers said at Monday's hearing that in prison, Bouraima took up Bible studies while Dato was baptized and received his first communion.

"I accept responsibility for what I have done," Bouraima said through a French interpreter.

The Taliban were pushed out of power in Afghanistan by the U.S. invasion that followed the al Qaeda attacks on U.S. targets on September 11, 2001.

The group has since waged an insurgency to overthrow the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and oust foreign troops.

ordered appearances to facilitate his daughter's return to her adopted parents, officials said.

Dusten Brown, who has Cherokee heritage and lives in Nowata, Oklahoma, was accompanied by a Cherokee Nation marshal as he was booked into the Sequoyah County Jail on a fugitive warrant, jail operations manager Jamie Faulkenberry said.

Brown left the jail after posting $10,000 personal recognizance bond.

The warrant was issued in South Carolina, where officials said they were working with Oklahoma officials to locate the daughter, Veronica, and arrange Brown's extradition on a charge of custodial interference.

Sequoyah County Sheriff Ron Lockhart said he has been in contact with authorities in South Carolina and that he expects to receive an extradition warrant from that state within the week.

"When we receive it, he will be picked up again and extradited to South Carolina," Lockhart said.

Lockhart added he did not believe Brown is a flight risk, due to his service in the Oklahoma National Guard and because he turned himself in.

"I know where he is and where he is staying," Lockhart said.

Brown failed to appear with Veronica for a recent visit with Veronica's legal parents, Matt and Melanie Capobianco of Charleston, South Carolina. The visit was part of a gradual reintroduction to the couple, who had raised her for the first 27 months of her life.

A statement from the Cherokee Nation said Veronica was with her father and "continues to be a happy, healthy, very loved girl who is thriving in her father's care."

After Brown failed to appear, the judge in the case threw out the transition plan and issued the arrest warrant.

The Capobiancos on Monday publicly pleaded for U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director Robert Mueller to help get Brown to comply with the July South Carolina Supreme Court decision that gave them custody of Veronica.

The same court had ordered them to give up Veronica to Brown more than a year ago under the Indian Child Welfare Act, which is intended to keep Native American children from being separated from their families.

The U.S. Supreme Court threw out that decision in June and ruled that Brown, who was not married to Veronica's birth mother and had provided no support, had no parental claim.

Veronica's birth mother, who is not a Native American, arranged the adoption before the girl was born. Veronica herself is 3/256ths Cherokee.

pound U.S. Army veteran was being held in Texas on $6.5 million bond on Monday, following last week's rampage that killed four women, including his estranged wife and girlfriend, officials said.

Former teacher Erbie Bowser, 44, is charged with three counts of capital murder and two counts of aggravated assault for a shooting rampage that began at the Dallas home of his girlfriend and ended at the nearby home of his estranged wife. He was arraigned on the charges on Sunday, authorities said.

Police said the 6-foot, 7-inch (2 meter) former member of the dance team for the Dallas Mavericks basketball team fatally shot girlfriend, Toya Smith, 43, and her daughter, Tasmia Allen, 17, at their southwest Dallas home. He also wounded Smith's 14-year-old son and a 17-year-old girl, a family friend, there.

He then went to the DeSoto home of his ex-wife, where he tossed an explosive device into the house before fatally shooting his ex-wife, Zina Bowser, 47, and her daughter Neima Williams, 28. Zina Bowser's two sons, 11 and 13, were shot and wounded, police said.

Bowser may face the death penalty if convicted of capital murder.

Zina Bowser, a nurse practitioner, had sought a protective order against Bower in January 2011, about a week after she filed for divorce. In her application for the protective order, she said she and her sons had once fled the house because Erbie Bowser was threatening her with a knife.

During one argument, she picked up the phone to call 911. Erbie Bowser allegedly told her: "Call the police, and I will execute your kids."

Bowser was by some accounts a well-liked special education teacher in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite, He resigned in 2010, said a spokeswoman for the Mesquite Independent School District.

Sixteen county maintenance department workers from New Jersey submitted the second winning ticket on Monday in the $448 million Powerball lottery, officials said.

The group from Ocean County, on the Jersey shore, was presented with a check for $86,054,355, their share of the jackpot after taxes, lottery officials said.

They produced the second of three winning tickets to the jackpot. The first winner who came forward last week was a Minnesota engineer, Paul White, and the final holder has not yet stepped forward publicly.

Several of the winning members of the Ocean County Vehicle Maintenance Department, nicknamed "Ocean 16," had been hard hit last year by Superstorm Sandy, lottery officials said.

"They are a great group of people, many of whom will continue to work at their jobs for an extended period of time," said Judith Drucker, a spokeswoman with the New Jersey Lottery.

They will be publicly introduced on Tuesday at a news conference in Toms River, New Jersey, lottery officials said.

Their winning ticket was purchased at an Acme Markets store in the New Jersey shore town of Little Egg Harbor. The third as-yet unclaimed winning ticket was sold at a Super Stop &amp; Shop supermarket in South Brunswick, New Jersey, officials said.

The Ocean County group waited several days to come forward after realizing they had won last Wednesday's drawing and continued to show up for work, according to the county department's director Jim Pine.

knit group," Pine told Reuters last week. "They are just an outstanding group of people."

The winning numbers were the Powerball number of 32 and numbers 5-25-30-58-59. The odds of winning the jackpot were about one in 175 million.

Powerball tickets are sold in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Five states - Kansas, Maryland, Delaware, North Dakota and Ohio - allow the winners to remain anonymous, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.



headline: Guests saved as Florida resort building falls into sinkhole

story building.

"I was hearing popping noises and I was hearing people screaming and glass breaking. The building actually twisted and separated," Summer Bay Resort security guard Richard Shanley said. "It was like something from a movie."

Shanley was driving a golf cart on the Orlando-area resort's main boulevard when a family hailed him to say they heard popping sounds and that something was wrong.

A spokesman for the Lake County Fire Department said there were no injuries in the collapse and that resort staff responded quickly to the first signs of danger.

Paul Caldwell, general manager of the 64-acre, lakeside resort, said the building collapsed almost entirely within 45 minutes, leaving only the top floor visible ground level. He estimated the sinkhole to be 100 feet (30m) wide.

Shanley, whom Caldwell called "a hero," said he saw balconies breaking. He rushed into the building and began banging on doors, using his master key to open some doors and wake people so they could get out.

He said that while he was on the second floor, he felt the building sink about 20 inches and saw the ceilings collapsing. By the time Shanley was on the third floor, he said that floor's ceiling had entirely collapsed.

Shanley kept going through the building until the fire department arrived and made him leave.

Asked if he felt his life was ever at risk, Shanley said, "Yes ma'am, but I didn't think of that at the time. I was more concerned about my guests and trying to get them out of here."

Thirty-six people were evacuated, including 20 from the collapsed building and 16 from another building emptied as a precaution, according to the resort's executive vice president, Juan Barrillas.

Caldwell praised Shanley for not waiting for authorization before evacuating guests. "Had he not acted on his own, we are confident there could have been many people trapped in that building."

SINKHOLE TROUBLES

Sinkholes in Florida are relatively common, caused by the state's porous geological bedrock of limestone. As acidic rainwater filters into the ground, it dissolves the rock, causing erosion that can lead to underground caverns, resulting in the sinkhole's collapse.

"One woman was sitting in the tub and the tub levitated and that's when she just grabbed a pair of shorts and came out," resort guest Maggie Ghamry told WFTV. She said another couple with an infant had to smash through a window after the door frame in the room collapsed.

Liz Evans, 57, a bank teller from North Carolina, watched the collapse with her grandsons from a nearby unit that lost electricity but was not evacuated. She said it was slow-moving and punctuated by creaking and cracking noises.

"It was like a rockslide coming down," Evans said.

The collapsed building had two wings of 12 units each, connected by an elevator tower in the breezeway.

Julian and Maggie Moreno of San Antonio, Texas, were staying with their daughter and two grandchildren in a two-bedroom suite opposite the collapsed building when they heard police in the hall yelling for everyone to "grab stuff and get out."

Julian Moreno tossed suitcases off a third-floor balcony. As they left the suite their door was already jamming, leading them to believe their building was also sinking.

Several dozen evacuated guests were being housed in other buildings on the property, about six miles from Walt Disney World, the resort said.

In March, a sinkhole under a Tampa-area home opened and swallowed the bedroom of 37-year-old landscaper Jeff Bush, whose body was never recovered.

In 1981, in Winter Park near Orlando, a sinkhole measuring 320-feet wide and 90-feet deep swallowed a two-story house, part of a Porsche dealership and an Olympic-size swimming pool. The site is now an artificial lake.

martial of Major Nidal Hasan for the 2009 shooting spree that killed 13 and wounded 31 at Fort Hood, Texas, on Monday described carnage and confusion usually reserved for live combat.

Hasan, 42, has admitted to shooting his fellow soldiers, saying he switched sides in what he called a U.S. war on Islam, and could face the death penalty if convicted.

"I could hear people screaming, brass hitting the ground. I could smell the smoke," testified retired Lieutenant Colonel Randy Royer, a major at the time who was shot in the leg and arm.

"I could see all the blood, the crumpled uniforms ... shell casings. It was just carnage," said Royer, who used a cane to steady himself in court.

More than 50 witnesses have taken the stand to describe the attack inside a medical facility at Fort Hood on November 5, 2009, days before Hasan, an Army psychiatrist and U.S.-born Muslim, was due to be deployed to Afghanistan.

"Hell broke loose," said Staff Sergeant Christopher Burgess, who described gunfire following him every time he and a group of people moved, trying to escape the building.

Many of the witness have said they at first believed the shooting was a training exercise because soldiers are normally prohibited from carrying weapons on base.

Several quoted Hasan as screaming "Allahu akbar" ("God is greatest" in Arabic) upon spraying gunfire with his laser-sighted handgun. Military police eventually shot Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down and attends court in a wheelchair.

Shemeka Hairston, a nurse, said she heard what sounded like firecrackers and saw a cloud of smoke. She called the 911 emergency line, and an operator advised her to "stay low."

"It sounded like the gunfire was getting closer," said Hairston, who wept on the stand and could be heard wailing upon leaving the courtroom.

As audio of Hairston's 911 call played, Hasan stared ahead at the screen displaying the transcript of the call, showing no emotion on his face. Hasan, who acts as his own lawyer, refrained from cross-examining any witnesses.

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges against Hasan, who could be sentenced to death if all 13 officers on the jury find him guilty of premeditated murder. The U.S. military has not executed a service member since 1961.



headline: Ten years after NE blackout, U.S. power grid smarter, sturdier
byline: By Scott DiSavino
8:31am EDT

It was just another hot August afternoon for New York electricity grid chief Rick Gonzales, as he sat in the control room helping to make sure the state's 8 million homes had enough power to keep the lights on and the air conditioning running.

While the temperature pushed toward 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the grid serving New York City and the rest of the state of 20 million people wasn't under any strain, Gonzales recalled, as the clock ticked past 4 p.m. on the East Coast.

But 500 miles away, a few benign tree branches were about to render Gonzales' territory - and that of 30 million unsuspecting others - powerless.

"In less than five seconds we went from normal operations to most of the state blacked out," Gonzales said recently.

"Alarms were ringing and our computers started flashing red. We didn't know if we were getting bad information or if this was a true blackout."

They soon found out. The Northeast blackout of August 14, 2003, was the biggest in North American history, and laid bare the vulnerabilities of an aging electric grid in the most populous region of the United States.

More than 50 million people from Ohio to Ontario would lose power, at an estimated cost of almost $10 billion. Coming just two years after September 11, the blackout reignited fears of what a targeted attack could achieve if, as an official report eventually concluded, a few untrimmed tree branches in Ohio could do that much damage.

Ten years on, electricity experts say a similar event is far less likely to happen in the U.S. Northeast. Grids and power companies have overhauled their operations, and regulators now have the authority to punish any company that doesn't adhere to rules covering everything from maintenance schedules to how close tree branches can get to power lines.

Of course as Hurricane Sandy demonstrated last year, "We'll never be able to eliminate (blackouts) entirely," said Jay Apt, a former NASA astronaut and physicist and director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center. "The frequency of large and small blackouts has not really changed since we became good at keeping statistics on them 30 years ago."

And while grid operators learn lessons from every major blackout, they face diverse threats, including attacks on cybersecurity.

MANDATORY STANDARDS

Eight months after the blackout, a joint U.S.-Canada task force issued a report on its causes along with recommendations for the prevention of future cascading power outages.

The power industry and energy regulators have since spent hundreds of millions of dollars on new monitoring equipment and improved computer systems, in addition to adopting new standards and improving worker training and equipment maintenance.

To make sure power companies follow the rules, the 2005 Energy Policy Act gave the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the ability to impose fines of up to $1 million per violation per day for failure to comply with the standards.

In 2009, Florida Power and Light, the biggest electricity company in the state, paid a $25 million settlement over FERC allegations that one of its workers had caused a blackout the previous year by not following proper procedures.

"That change from voluntary to mandatory reliability standards is something we strongly supported since we were impacted by the lack of clear rules," said Gonzales, who is now the chief operating officer of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), which runs the state's power grid.

The task force determined that Ohio power company FirstEnergy Corp triggered the 2003 blackout because it didn't understand how vulnerable its system was.

A failure in FirstEnergy's computer system was compounded by human error after a technician called in to fix it forgot to turn back on a key application for monitoring the grid.

At the same time, the Midwest grid operator was experiencing its own computer problems. The two together were essentially flying blind, and did not detect the shutdown of several power lines that had been hit by wayward trees.

With no reaction from FirstEnergy or the grid operator, other lines quickly became overloaded. What followed was a power surge that grew large enough to jump state lines, first knocking out power in Michigan, rolling through Ontario and ultimately knocking New York offline. The whole event took little over an hour from when the first branch hit the power line in Ohio.

A spokesman for FirstEnergy, one of four investor-owned power companies in Ohio, said it has made efforts to strengthen the Ohio power grid. "FirstEnergy has added new facilities and equipment, enhanced operator training, and implemented new standards that are mandatory and enforceable in order to help enhance the reliability of the transmission grid," said Mark Durban.

Since 2003 Ohio has had numerous widespread blackouts caused by snow and thunder storms, but the number of outages caused by faulty equipment or human error has been falling, according to a company that tracks blackouts and their causes.

Eaton, a power services company, said in its annual report that Ohio had only 28 blackouts last year due to equipment failures or human error. While the state still ranks seventh in the United States for power outages, it was second only to California in 2009, when it had 42.

SHARPER SKILLS THROUGH SIMULATIONS

Gonzales said that in 2003 there was no early warning that could have made a difference.

"We had no idea something was wrong with the power system in Ohio. It was a normal, warm summer day."

To help speed the recovery, the grid operator relied on just "one guy in a truck" navigating his way through congested traffic to reconnect the state to the wider grid at a substation just north of the New Jersey border, where they still had power.

New York utilities restored power to about two-thirds of homes and businesses by 8 a.m. Eastern time Friday, about 16 hours after the blackout started. Service was completely back after about 30 hours.

Gonzales says the same lack of information from neighboring grids would be improbable now. New technology allows the grid operator to take far more sophisticated measurements of its own system's power flows as well as neighboring systems', and faster than before.

Apt, at Carnegie Mellon, said training of grid controllers now includes frequent test runs to sharpen their skills in the event of a major disruption to the grid.

"We're doing a lot more simulation now," he said. "It's like what they say about airline pilots - it's years of boredom interspersed with moments of stark terror."

CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES

While the grid is now seen as less susceptible to human error, malicious threats have risen.

Cyber intrusions and attempted attacks on grid computer systems have increased dramatically over the last decade, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, raising fears of both widespread power cuts and threats to nuclear facilities.

Gerry Cauley, president of the North American Electric Reliability Corp (NERC), the agency enforcing grid standards, said the power industry has made significant progress to address cybersecurity threats since he returned as president in 2010.

"I walked in the door and I felt a black hole of worry, risk and problems in terms of security. We were not in good shape at NERC or in the industry in terms of understanding what we should be doing and where we needed to focus," Cauley told an industry meeting earlier this year.

"We have been able to turn that around. It has become a way of life for us," Cauley said.

The power industry has put mandatory cybersecurity standards in place, including the requirement to share information quickly between grid operators, companies and regulators in the event of an attack. The U.S. government is also looking at implementing its own rules.

The other big challenge is the changing way the United States generates power.

Since 2003 enough coal plants to power 15 million homes have shut down or converted to natural gas as their primary fuel source. That has left some grid operators questioning if they will ever face natural gas supply squeezes on the coldest days when they compete with energy companies providing gas to heat homes.

Renewables, like wind and solar power, also present some difficulty because they're less predictable. Grids and power companies are now experimenting with ways of cutting demand at times of peak consumption.

PJM Interconnection, which oversees a grid serving 61 million people in 13 parts of states from New Jersey to Illinois, uses so-called demand response programs, which compensate large companies and consumers for cutting back the power they use when the grid is under strain.

That can reduce electricity use for a short period of time by as much as 10,000 megawatts - the equivalent of enough electricity to power New York City on an average day.

PJM is also experimenting with using giant batteries, and programs that may enable owners of electric vehicles to sell power back even as they are charging their cars.

Chantal-Aimee Hendrzak, PJM executive director of system operations support, said the grid is looking at integrating a host of unconventional electric technologies.

"It does not have to be something new," she said. "Batteries, water heaters, flywheels, electric vehicles can all respond in less than a second to add (or remove) power. The more devices that can be used to balance the grid, the fewer big power plants have to be held in reserve."

equipped for the Idaho wilderness.

The two were not especially friendly and appeared out of place in Idaho's rugged backcountry, like "a square peg going into a round hole," said Mark John, a retired Gem County, Idaho, sheriff who was riding with his wife and another couple when they encountered the pair last week.

Hannah Anderson, 16, was rescued and her suspected abductor James Lee DiMaggio, 40, shot and killed by an FBI agent in the weekend rescue. She was expected to be reunited with her father on Sunday, but authorities gave no details as to where and when.

Anderson was airlifted on Saturday evening from an alpine lake in west-central Idaho after her rescue in the rough terrain of the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness that culminated in DiMaggio's death.

The rescue came after a two-day manhunt by law enforcement agents in the rugged mountains for DiMaggio, who was wanted in the killing of Anderson's mother, Christina Anderson, 44, and her brother Ethan, 8.

John, a rancher and retired U.S. Army Ranger, told a news conference that he and his wife and the other couple discussed among themselves the oddness of the situation. The encounters with Anderson and DiMaggio raised red flags for them.

The girl and man were not eager to speak with them and she appeared scared at times, though they were not sure if it was of the horses, the riders said.

Another of the riders, Mike Young, told reporters DiMaggio had set up camp on an exposed ridge that had no water source and where they might have been battered by strong winds or struck by lightning in a storm, also raising questions.

"He may have been an outdoorsman from California but he was not an outdoorsman from Idaho, he didn't fit," John said of DiMaggio.

DiMaggio, a longtime friend of the Anderson family, was killed by an FBI agent after he and the teenager were spotted at a primitive campsite on Saturday afternoon near Morehead Lake, about 90 miles northeast of Boise, the state capital.

It was unclear if DiMaggio was armed.

INVESTIGATION ONGOING

Authorities were withholding details about the shooting pending an FBI investigation. The FBI reviews the circumstances in any situation where an agent has fired a gun, Mary Rook, head of the FBI's Salt Lake City office, said on Saturday.

The girl suffered no apparent injuries but was to be evaluated at an area hospital, Rook said.

On CNN, the children's grandmother said the girl had loved to read to her little brother. "She was the best big sister ever," Sara Britt, the grandmother, said.

She called Ethan "an ecstatic, happy little guy" who loved to fish.

The search of Western states for the pair narrowed to Idaho last week after the two couples riding horses in the backcountry reported seeing them on a trail near Morehead Lake.

The Frank Church wilderness stretches across 2.3 million acres of towering peaks, alpine forests and wild and scenic rivers in central Idaho.

Police found DiMaggio's car, covered with brush and stripped of license plates, at a trailhead at the edge of the wilderness. That triggered a massive search on foot, horseback and air by federal, state and local law enforcement.

Anderson, her mother and her brother were last seen on August 3. The next day, DiMaggio, a telecommunications technician, is suspected of setting his home on fire in San Diego.

Police found the bodies of Christina Anderson and her young son in the house but have declined to say how they were killed.

The mountain rescue was complicated by steep terrain, and a helicopter was used to drop FBI hostage rescue teams far from the lake where DiMaggio set up camp. The teams hiked in for two hours, said Ada County Sheriff's Office spokesman Patrick Orr.

San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said on Saturday that the girl's father, Brett Anderson, was "elated" she was found alive.

"Obviously, he was very relieved and very excited and looking forward to being reunited with his daughter," he said.

Police have said they are still trying to identify what prompted the crimes and DiMaggio's motives.

"To do such a horrific act, it's just not fathomable because he loved them too," the children's grandmother said on CNN.

The ruling by San Francisco Superior Court Judge Curtis Karnow to bar Bay Area Rapid Transit District workers from striking took effect immediately and remains in place through October 10, 2013. It provides a cooling-off period in the contentious labor negotiations.

BART management and the unions representing its 2,600 workers have been in talks for more than four months and have been millions of dollars apart on a potential settlement.

The judge issued the injunction following a rare Sunday-morning hearing, which he said was held to determine whether a strike would "significantly disrupt public transportation services and endanger the public's health, safety or welfare."

"This hearing has nothing at all to do with the merits of this dispute between the unions and BART," Karnow said.

Neither BART management nor the unions objected to the injunction in court.

California Governor Jerry Brown sought the 60-day injunction on Friday.

The strike would have been the unions' second walkout of the summer.

The BART rail system was shut down for 4-1/2 days in July when union workers walked off the job, creating severe roadway congestion and forcing commuters to miss work or crowd onto a limited number of other public transportation options.

Brown averted a proposed strike last Sunday by appointing a three-person board to investigate the BART labor feud. The board was charged with hearing from both sides and reporting back to the governor on its findings.

After a heated public meeting on Wednesday, the board found that a strike would result in "significant harm to the public's health, safety and welfare," Brown said on Friday.

The public safety threat determination was needed for Brown to seek the cooling-off order.

BART management, which had supported the cooling-off time, reported a $62 million gap in contract terms at Wednesday's meeting.

Union officials, who had opposed the cooling-off period, said there was a $56 million difference in proposals.

Management has said it offered workers a 9 percent pay raise over four years but wants employees to pay 5 percent of their salaries toward pensions. Employees currently do not contribute to their pensions.

The unions have said they want a 15 percent raise over three years and that additional pay increases would be needed to offset the higher benefit contributions.

BART management says the average employee gets an annual salary of $79,500 plus $50,800 in benefits, and it is concerned the cost of benefits will continue to climb after increasing by nearly 200 percent in 10 years.

Union representatives peg salaries of BART workers at $64,000 on average, saying that management's figures included higher salaries for managers.

A woman last seen clinging to a tree along the swollen banks of a rising creek is the only person still unaccounted for from a Colorado flash flood and mudslide that killed at least one person, authorities said on Sunday.

The woman, described as young with blond hair, was seen by witnesses as they fled the rushing waters west of Colorado Springs, El Paso County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lieutenant Jeff Kramer said.

The flood and mudslide were triggered on Friday night when nearly 1.5 inches of rain fell in 30 minutes over an area stripped of vegetation by a 2012 wildfire.

Fountain Creek jumped its banks from the heavy rainfall, and floodwaters cascaded down mountainsides onto a narrow canyon highway.

Authorities said the body of a 53-year-old man was found outside his vehicle under a pile of debris along the roadway. Two other people also reported missing have since been accounted for, authorities said.

Autopsy results are pending, but authorities believe the man drowned when trapped in the flood.

A wall of water, debris and mud from the deluge flowed into downtown Manitou Springs, which sits about 6.5 miles west of Colorado Springs at the foot of Pikes Peak.

Manitou Springs Police Chief Joe Ribeiro said on Saturday that initial damage assessments revealed six buildings in the downtown area were unsafe to enter and another 11 sustained some structural damage. Three people had been missing.

Additionally, about 40 vehicles swept away by the flood and mudslide were towed out of the debris, Ribeiro said.

Colombian-born Israel Hernandez-Llach died on Tuesday after police shocked him with a Taser as he ran away from officers who caught him spray-painting the wall of a shuttered McDonald's.

"He was a genius," said Lucy Rynka, 18, who graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School with Hernandez-Llach last spring. "He showed me how powerful art can be, how you can use color and design to relay a powerful message."

Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez has said that Hernandez-Llach was confronted by officers after vandalizing private property and ignored their commands to stop running.

Once in custody, Hernandez showed signs of medical distress and was pronounced dead soon after, Martinez said. A formal cause of death has not been established in the case pending toxicology results.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement said on Friday it would conduct an independent review of the Miami Beach Police Department's investigation into the death of Hernandez-Llach, who was known as "Reefa" and whose work had appeared in some Miami art galleries.

Florida's state attorney and the medical examiner for Miami-Dade County are also reviewing the case, officials said.

Miami Beach police has come under scrutiny in recent years for a series of shootings and improper conduct, including the death of a 22-year-old man who was shot 16 times by police two years ago during a Memorial Day weekend hip-hop festival.

During the peaceful rally attended by around 400 people, some in the crowd booed and whistled at police officers standing nearby and shouted, "Whose streets? Our streets!"

The teen's father, Israel Hernandez-Bandera has called his son's death "an act of barbarism" and an "assassination of a young artist and photographer."

Jason W. Kreiss, an attorney representing the family, said Hernandez-Llach would likely not have been prosecuted over the spray-painting and would have probably faced a punishment of community service.

At the Saturday rally, the wall where Hernandez-Llach spray-painted was covered with his nickname and messages.

"The only thing I want everyone to remember is his goal was to have his art around the world," said Vivian Azalia, 18, told the crowd while fighting back tears. "I know he'd be happy with the support that's come from around the world and from the graffiti community."

area rail worker strike that threatens to disable a critical part of the region's transportation system serving 400,000 daily passengers.

California Governor Jerry Brown announced plans on Friday to seek an injunction to bar Bay Area Rapid Transit District workers from striking for 60 days if the transit agency and its employees fail to resolve their contract dispute by Sunday.

BART management and the unions representing its 2,600 workers have been in contentious negotiations for more than four months and have been millions of dollars apart on a potential settlement.

San Francisco Superior Court Judge Curtis Karnow is scheduled to consider Brown's request for the 60-day "cooling-off" period, which would be in effect through midnight on October 10, according to the injunction application filed with the court.

If the request is not granted, the unions could strike as early as Monday in their second walkout of the summer.

The BART rail system was shut down for 4-1/2 days in July when union workers walked off the job, creating severe roadway congestion and forcing commuters to miss work or crowd onto a limited number of other public transportation options.

headline: Young victims of Connecticut plane crash to be identified Saturday
byline: By Richard Weizel
8:31am EDT

The mayor of East Haven, Connecticut, where four people died on Friday when a small plane piloted by a retired Microsoft Corp executive crashed into two houses, said the two youngest victims will likely be identified later on Saturday.

Searchers, who had estimated as many as six deaths in the crash and subsequent fire, now believe they have found all the victims, said East Haven Mayor Joe Maturo.

"Everyone has now been accounted for," a visibly shaken Maturo told a press conference on Saturday. "Right now our thoughts are with the families of the deceased and our efforts are to ensure the safety and well-being of the neighborhood by taking down the two houses impacted by the crash."

The deceased pilot, Bill Henningsgaard, and his son Maxwell had been on a trip to visit colleges when the plane crashed at midday on Friday, according to a Bellevue, Washington nonprofit organization where he had served as executive director.

"The loss of Bill and Max is tragic," the organization, Eastside Pathways, said.

The two victims whose identities have not yet been disclosed were children, East Haven town officials said. But neighbors interviewed near the crash site said on Friday that the victims were aged 1 and 13.

The four victims' bodies have been taken to the office of the state medical examiner, which expects to disclose their names at a 5 p.m. ET (2100 GMT) press conference, Maturo said. The National Transportation Safety Board also plans to provide an update on its investigation at that time, he added.

The twin-engine propeller plane had taken off from Teterboro airport in New Jersey on Friday morning and had been attempting to land at Tweed New Haven Airport, about 40 miles south of Hartford, in rainy weather when it crashed.

East Haven is a town of about 30,000 people located near the Long Island Sound, about 85 miles northeast of New York City.

Two bodies had been recovered from the site on Friday and two additional bodies were recovered overnight, East Haven Fire Department Assistant Chief Chuck Licata said on Saturday.

"We were able to pull four bodies from the plane and one of the homes," Licata said.

A Microsoft spokesman confirmed that Henningsgaard was a former employee of the company.

The pilot's brother, Blair Henningsgaard, described Bill Henningsgaard as a careful pilot who had taken up flying after retiring from Microsoft.

"This is the third plane he's owned," Henningsgaard told Connecticut's WTNH television. He added that his brother had crashed once before, in 2009, when the fuel system on his plane malfunctioned.

That hadn't deterred him from returning to the cockpit, Henningsgaard said. "He believed that there wasn't anything that he couldn't figure out and accomplish if he put his mind to it."

Maturo praised former teacher David Esposito, who lived nearby the crash site, for running into one of the houses and searching for the children following the crash.

"People like Mr. Esposito are the true heroes," Maturo said.



headline: Authorities comb Idaho wilderness for murder suspect
byline: By Laura Zuckerman
8:31am EDT

More than 150 law enforcement officers on foot and horseback on Saturday spent a second day combing the central Idaho wilderness in search of a California man suspected of killing a friend and her son and abducting her teenage daughter.

A national manhunt for fugitive James Lee DiMaggio, 40, and 16-year-old Hannah Anderson focused on the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness after a group of backcountry horsemen reported to Idaho authorities that on Wednesday they had encountered a pair they believed to be the suspect and the teen.

One horseman told police he exchanged casual pleasantries with them and that their appearance on a trail to a mountain lake was odd but not cause for alarm, authorities said. Police searched the trailhead for clues and found DiMaggio's car, stripped of its license plates and covered with brush. Police feared the car could be rigged with explosives but a bomb squad found none on Friday.

Authorities in Idaho said on Saturday that no other sightings have been reported and air, land and river searches have so far uncovered no signs of the pair in rugged mountainous terrain crisscrossed by sheer granite canyons and whitewater rapids.

Joe DiMaggio, the suspect's uncle, raised concerns on Saturday about his nephew's state of mind. He said his nephew has been haunted by the suicide of his father and the cancer death of his mother some years back.

"I wish I knew what he was thinking," said DiMaggio, who has been in sporadic touch with his nephew in recent years. DiMaggio said his nephew is an experienced hunter, fisherman and camper.

The telecommunications technician is wanted in the killing of Christina Anderson, 44, and 8-year-old Ethan and in the disappearance of Hannah, all of whom were last seen last Saturday, the day before DiMaggio is suspected of setting his house on fire in the Southern California community of Boulevard, triggering a multi-state search.

The San Diego County Sheriff confirmed late Friday that the remains of a second body found at the house were Ethan's. Police declined to say how Christina Anderson or her son were killed.

As teams of searchers hiked, rode horseback and flew over the towering peaks, alpine forests, granite cliffs and undammed rivers of the Frank Church wilderness on Saturday, San Diego County authorities underscored their belief that DiMaggio had planned to hide out in the 2.3 million-acre (930,780-hectare), largely roadless area long before he fled with the 16-year-old.

CHALLENGING TERRAIN

DiMaggio bought camping equipment and other gear in the weeks leading up to his flight and news that he had relatives in Idaho strengthened the links between a crime scene in California and the untamed lands of the Frank Church, authorities said.

"We don't think this was random or that he ended up there by chance," said San Diego County Sheriff's Captain Larry Nesbit.

One of the backcountry horsemen interviewed by police said the pair he encountered appeared to be in good health and that he saw no indication that the girl was upset or being held against her will, said Andrea Dearden of the Ada County Sheriff's Office in Idaho.

Asked if police suspected the 16-year-old of complicity in the crimes, Nesbit said, "At this point, nothing leads us to that conclusion. That will be a factor that will be looked at when we interview her after her rescue."

The Frank Church, which draws thousands of international visitors every summer season for whitewater rafting, fishing, camping and hiking, contains some of the most challenging terrain in the Lower 48 states.

Chris Grove, district ranger with the national forest in Idaho that oversees the wilderness, said fallen trees and routes that lead to impassable cliffs will make the going slow for anyone traveling cross country.

"On a good trail, someone who is highly motivated can probably log 15 miles a day. But cross country can be brutal, slowing travel to less than 2 miles a day," he said.

Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Office and the Idaho Bureau of Homeland Security, have set up checkpoints at all trailheads to monitor anyone going in or out of the wilderness, according to the Ada County Sheriff's Office.

Carl Hess, head wrangler at a guest ranch near where the pair thought to be DiMaggio and Hannah Anderson was spotted on Wednesday, said weather, equipment and survival skills will determine how long they last in the wilderness.

"If he's a city Joe, not long," he said. "If he's a seasoned outdoorsman, until the snow flies."



headline: One dead, three missing in Colorado flash flood and mudslide

One man was killed and three people were missing in Colorado after floodwaters and a mudslide triggered by torrential rains roared down mountainsides stripped of vegetation by a wildfire, authorities said on Saturday.

The body of an unidentified man was found early Saturday on the side of a highway that leads up to the 14,000-foot (4,300-metre) Pikes Peak, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

"The body was not inside a vehicle and much of the body was buried beneath significant amounts of debris," the sheriff's office said.

The cause of death is under investigation.

Nearly 1.5 inches of rain fell in 30 minutes Friday night in an area devastated by a wildfire last year, causing a creek to overflow its banks and cascade across a state highway and into the town of Manitou Springs, about 6.5 miles west of Colorado Springs.

Manitou Springs Police Chief Joe Ribeiro told a news conference on Saturday that three people are unaccounted for and an unknown number of homes and businesses were destroyed by the flood and mud flow.

Footage aired by local television showed a wall of water carrying vehicles down the narrow canyon roadway and into the town, which sits at the foot of Pikes Peak.

Leslie Lewis, executive director of the Manitou Springs Chamber of Commerce, said she was in her office when flood warning sirens went off Friday evening.

She watched as Fountain Creek jumped its banks and when the waters receded, the downtown area was strewn with tree branches, other debris and several inches of mud.

"Now I know why they call it a flash flood - it was a very, very quick event," she said by phone.

The National Weather Service issued another flash flood watch for the area on Saturday, as heavy rains are forecast to hover over the region.



headline: Plane in Connecticut crash was upside down, official says

8:31am EDT

A plane flown by a retired Microsoft Corp. executive that crashed into a Connecticut neighborhood was upside down when it hit two houses, killing the pilot, his son and two young girls on the ground, officials said on Saturday.

Patrick Murray, a lead investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, said there was no preliminary indication the plane was in distress or suffering from mechanical failure before it slammed into the houses in East Haven on Friday.

The pilot, Bill Henningsgaard, and his 17-year-old son, Maxwell, were on a trip to visit colleges when the plane crashed. Both died in the accident.

On Saturday, authorities identified the two other victims, a 13-year-old and one-year-old, both girls, who were inside one of the houses at the time of the crash.

The mother of the two girls, 39-year-old Joann Mitchell, was at home at the time and survived without any injuries.

"My heart is at a standstill," Mitchell wrote on her Facebook page. "The feeling of emptiness engulfs me. Mommy will always love you ... RIP my sweet angels."

The twin-engined propeller plane took off from Teterboro airport in New Jersey on Friday morning and had been attempting to land at Tweed New Haven Airport, about 40 miles south of Hartford, in rainy weather when it crashed.

"We don't know yet whether that played a role in the crash," Murray told reporters.

"There is no evidence right now that the pilot was in distress during his last conversation with the control tower and it appears he was turning to try and land when the tower lost contact with him," he said.

East Haven is a town of about 30,000 people located near the Long Island Sound, about 85 miles northeast of New York City.

A Microsoft spokesman confirmed that Henningsgaard was a former employee of the company.

The pilot's brother, Blair Henningsgaard, described Bill Henningsgaard as a careful pilot who had taken up flying after retiring from Microsoft.

byline: By Eric M. Johnson
8:31am EDT

An American Christian missionary imprisoned in North Korea is in deteriorating health and has been moved from a prison work camp to a hospital within the past two weeks, his sister said at a vigil for her brother on Saturday.

Kenneth Bae was sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor after North Korea's Supreme Court convicted him of state subversion. The court said Bae, 45, had used his tourism business to form groups to overthrow the government.

Bae was detained in November as he led a tour group through the northern region of the country. His sentencing came amid acrimonious relations between Pyongyang and Washington over the reclusive state's nuclear program.

Bae's sister Terri Chung said that her brother had until recently been held at a prison for foreigners and put to work plowing and planting fields.

However, he is suffering from a range of health problems including an enlarged heart and chronic diabetes as well as back and leg pain, necessitating his transfer to a state hospital, she said.

Chung said she learned of her brother's transfer from the Swedish ambassador to North Korea, who visited Bae on Friday. The ambassador, who has met with Bae a handful of times since his detention, has been his only foreign visitor, Chung said.

Chung's comments came at a prayer vigil for Bae at a Seattle Church on Saturday evening attended by more than 100 friends, family and supporters. Chung also read from a letter sent by Bae to his supporters written on June 13, in which he encouraged them to push his case with American officials.

"The only way I can be free to return home is by obtaining amnesty," Bae wrote. "In order for that to happen it will take more active efforts from the U.S. government side."

INTERNET PETITION

Two American journalists arrested in 2009 by North Korea and held until former President Bill Clinton traveled there to negotiate their release were organizing a satellite vigil in New York, one of the journalists, Euna Lee said.

North Korea has in the past used the release of high-profile American prisoners as a means of garnering a form of prestige or acceptance by portraying visiting dignitaries as paying homage to the country and its leader.

That pattern has complicated the response of U.S. lawmakers and the State Department, which has called for Bae's immediate release on "humanitarian grounds," but resisted sending high-profile envoys to negotiate, as it has done in the past.

An Internet petition started by Bae's son urging U.S. President Barack Obama to secure a "Special Amnesty" for Bae has garnered nearly 8,000 signatures.

There have been other calls for his release, such as a Twitter message from former basketball player Dennis Rodman, who visited North Korea in February, but Chung said U.S. officials have assured her they are pursuing quieter clemency efforts.

Reports last month that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was set to visit North Korea to negotiate for Bae were ultimately denied as false.

Bae, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Korea who moved to the United States with his family in 1985, has spent much of the last seven years in China, where he started a business leading tour groups into the northern region of North Korea, Chung said.



headline: Gay couple seeks spousal privilege protection in Kentucky murder trial
byline: By Tim Ghianni
8:31am EDT

sex couple has spousal privilege that would shield her from testifying against her partner is at the heart of a capital murder case in politically conservative Kentucky.

Geneva Case, 49, does not want to testify in a Louisville court against her partner, Bobbie Jo Clary, 37, who is accused of beating George Murphy, 64, to death with a hammer in 2011 and then stealing his van.

Prosecutors say Case must testify because of her value as a witness, since she heard Clary admit to the slaying and also saw blood on the interior of the victim's van after the killing.

Clary says Murphy used a hammer to sexually assault her, and she defended herself by hitting him over the head.

Clary is also charged with tampering with evidence to cover up the crime. If convicted, Clary could face the death penalty.

Under Kentucky law, a person cannot be called to testify against his or her spouse. Most states have a similar type of law.

But Kentucky is not among the 13 states that have legalized gay marriage. In 2004, it amended the state constitution to define marriage as being a union between a man and a woman.

Susan Sommer, an attorney for Lambda Legal, a national legal organization for the protection of gay rights, said she was not familiar with the details of the Kentucky case, but Lambda believes gay couples should have the same legal protections as other married people.

"Spousal privilege is one part of the tremendous bundle of protections for a committed couple that come automatically with marriage," Sommer said.

Case and Clary were joined in a civil union in 2004 in Vermont. Vermont first allowed civil unions in 2000, but did not legalize same-sex marriage until 2009.

"Kentucky's marital privilege law does not give Ms. Case the right not to testify in a murder trial," said Stacy Greive, assistant commonwealth attorney for Jefferson County. "And the reason marital privilege does not apply to Ms. Case in her relationship with the defendant is because it is our opinion and our belief that they do not have a marriage that is recognized under Kentucky law."

Greive argues that not only is the union not recognized in Kentucky, but the couple has not presented proof they have a valid marriage under Vermont law. "They have a civil union, if you look at Vermont's statutes, they distinguish between civil unions and marriage," she said.

SUPREME COURT

Both Clary's attorney, Angela Elleman, and Case's attorney, Bryan Gatewood, said the Kentucky marriage amendment is unconstitutional and the pair should be treated like any other married couple.

The attorneys also say they are cautiously optimistic that this case will lead to the amendment being held as unconstitutional, setting a precedent for change nationwide.

In light of recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings on gay marriage, "the climate is right" for the Kentucky amendment to be thrown out, Elleman said.

The high court in June forced the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages in states where it is legal and paved the way for it in California, the most populous state. The court struck down a section of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, limiting the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman for the purpose of federal benefits, as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.

"I believe the handwriting is already on the wall," Gatewood said. He believes the Kentucky attorney general's office, which says it is reviewing the case, will find that the state law is unconstitutional under the same reasoning.

Elleman said it makes no sense to her that Kentucky does not recognize legal unions of same-sex partners but does recognize common-law marriages from other states.

She also pointed to the personal toll on the couple. "The commonwealth is seeking to call her wife as a witness against her, which obviously would cause irreparable harm to their relationship," Elleman said.

Case called the situation "very stressful" in an interview on WHAS-TV in Louisville. "I wish she could come home," Case said of Clary. "There's nothing we can do right now, though."

Elleman said she is confident her client will be acquitted, "whether her wife will testify or not."

Clary is being held on $75,000 bond.

The trial is set for August 30. Jefferson County Judge Susan Schultz Gibson is expected to rule on the spousal privilege issue later this month.

Lambda's Sommer represented a woman in a criminal case in Maryland about two years ago who was asked to testify against her spouse.

In that case, which was not a homicide, the prosecutor opposed the use of spousal privilege since Maryland did not yet have gay marriage. The couple had married in another state. The judge in that case ruled that the woman did not have to testify against her spouse.



headline: In rural Maine, rise of the machines pushes out migrant pickers
byline: By Dave Sherwood
8:31am EDT

old coffee farmer from the cloud forests of Intibucá, Honduras, grins as he tops off a plastic crate of wild Maine blueberries.

Argueta said he can make as much as $1,000 per week here, with free housing, subsidized food and even health care provided, a deal that has long enticed migrants to Maine's blueberry fields from as far away as Mexico, Honduras and Haiti.

The work is back-breaking, he said, but the atmosphere festive. Mariachi music booms from loudspeakers, a roving lunch truck hawks authentic Mexican fare and workers jibe one another in their native Spanish.

Despite the perks, this year's trip will be Argueta's last to the far northeast of the United States, nearly 4,000 miles from the border with Mexico that is the focus of much of the nation's immigration debate.

"The tractors are taking all the good work," he said.

Argueta has a work visa and entered the country legally — a requirement as the larger blueberry growers adopt E-Verify, a federal electronic verification system that quickly catches false documents.

Jobs previously filled by those with dubious documents haven't transferred to Americans, as some proponents of E-Verify anticipated. Instead, many of Maine's largest growers have pushed to mechanize the harvest, eliminating many of the once-coveted seasonal jobs.

It is an unexpected consequence, observers said, of decades of uncertainty and political wrangling over immigration reform.

"Whether you're running a business or a family, everyone here just wants some long-term clarity on the issue. You can't plan for five years ahead because you don't know what the law will look like," said Ian Yaffe, executive director of Mano en Mano, a local group that aids migrant farm workers.

A comprehensive bill passed by the U.S. Senate in June included a proposal to help farmers and other businesses hire foreign workers, but was pronounced dead on arrival in the U.S. House of Representatives.

With little hope for resolution, Maine growers see few alternatives to mechanization, as migrant labor dries up and few Americans appear to take their place.

Though the state keeps no official tally, the Maine Wild Blueberry Commission said the number of seasonal workers employed here has dropped nearly 80 percent in 15 years, to fewer than 1,000 last year.

"There are people that say if we just paid more, Americans would do the work. But that's a joke," said Ed Flanagan, president of Jasper Wyman &amp; Son Inc, Maine's second-largest blueberry grower. Flanagan says hard-working pickers make as much as $20 an hour here, almost three times Maine's minimum wage of $7.50.

Unemployment has hovered persistently around 10 percent in Washington County, a poor, sparsely populated corner of Maine where the economy revolves around agriculture, forestry and tourism. The problem is acute throughout the oldest, whitest state in the nation.

Despite that, the seasonal jobs, which offer a short period of intense physical labor, found few takers among area residents and were traditionally filled by migrants.

"We could see the writing on the wall," said Ragnar Kamp, general manager of Cherryfield Foods Inc, Maine's largest blueberry grower.

"They kept turning the knob on us. It's becoming harder and harder to find people, and costing more and more to hire them. And the risks were terrible. It just wasn't worth it," he added, in reference to stricter federal regulation of migrant workers.

The company once hired as many as 1,500 handpickers, but has now turned entirely to a mechanized harvest, Kamp said.

In 2011, Whitney Blueberries, a smaller grower with just 300 acres, partnered with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to ensure its seasonal staff of handpickers are legal, said company operations officer Durand Cercone.

"We want to do things right" said Cercone. "But every year its a gamble. You never know if enough people are going to show up to get the job done."

This year, he said they'd gotten lucky: A group of documented Haitians, many here as refugees and anxious to work, had filled vacant slots. Next year, he said, is anybody's guess.

"You can see why people are going towards mechanization," said Cercone. "It's a tough call when you've got berries rotting in the field."

headline: For mixed-status families, U.S. immigration reform would end anxiety

born older brother, Edder, has applied for a program to avoid deportation, while their undocumented mother, Angelica, cleans houses to keep the family fed and, above all, together.

They are among millions of families across the United States made up of citizens, so-called Dreamers and immigrants without legal status who are hopeful that a comprehensive immigration overhaul might finally simplify their lives.

The U.S. Senate passed a sweeping bill backed by President Barack Obama in June that offers a pathway to citizenship for many of the country's 11 million illegal immigrants, but the Republican-led House of Representatives opposes it.

For Junnyor and 16 million others like him in mixed-status families, reform could bring stability to a fraught situation in which a U.S.-born child is a citizen with a shot at a university education and a stable working life, while a sibling or parent born abroad can face instability and deportation.

"There isn't a day that goes by that I don't worry for either my brother or my mother," said Junnyor, a basketball-loving 16-year-old whose childhood in Phoenix has been filled with anxiety. "I just want it to go away."

The family's complex life began when Angelica slipped over the porous border from Mexico with then 4-year-old Edder in 1995 in search of a better life in Arizona. She quickly found work washing dishes and enrolled Edder in school. A year later, Junnyor was born a U.S. citizen.

Edder, now 23, acquired English swiftly, but he faced challenges on graduating high school in 2007. Despite grades that got him into a pre-law course at Arizona State University, he faced hefty international student fees because of his status.

"We were having to pay three times as much as any other student," Edder said. Ineligible for student loans and financial aid, he dropped out after a year.

His difficulties came amid a backlash from anti-illegal immigration activists and sweeps for the undocumented by a tough local sheriff, Joe Arpaio.

TERRIFYING ARREST

In 2010, a state law was passed requiring police to question those they stopped and suspected of being in the country illegally about their immigration status. That year, Edder was detained after he and a U.S.-born friend took an illegal shortcut across the tracks of a light rail network.

"They let him go ... but the police came, handcuffed me and arrested me," he said.

After being interviewed by federal immigration police, he was sent to the Eloy Detention Center in the desert southeast of Phoenix and placed in deportation proceedings.

"I was terrified ... my family is here, my life is here," he said. "It was nothing I had ever experienced before." It took Angelica two months to scrape together the $12,500 bond to secure Edder's release to a family transformed by the experience.

With limited work and study options, Edder threw himself into community activism in Phoenix, registering Latinos to vote in local and presidential elections.

Junnyor joined him canvassing door to door during his school vacation, becoming more aware of the opportunities and the responsibilities that befall the only citizen in the family.

"My brother had to go through all that stuff (but) I can do whatever I want," Junnyor said. Two years from high school graduation, he has already sounded out several colleges about studying medicine and wants to become a pediatrician.

"I want to make my mother proud, I want to make my brother proud, I want to make myself proud," he said.

While the Senate passed an immigration overhaul, House Republicans are divided over the granting of legal status to those in the country illegally, a step many see as rewarding lawbreakers.

With the fate of the legislation now uncertain, the Diaz family remains hopeful for even incremental changes to the immigration system. After a lifetime of uncertainty, Junnyor is impatient to put the travails of mixed status behind them.

"It's not just me, there's millions of families across the nation who just hope that this whole thing just goes away."



headline: U.S. says no charges for border agent who shot Mexican teen
byline: By Tim Gaynor
8:31am EDT

throwing Mexican teenager two years ago because the fatal injury did not occur in the United States, the Justice Department said on Friday.

An unidentified Border Patrol agent shot Ramses Barron, a 17-year-old Mexican citizen, through the border fence in Nogales, Arizona, in the early hours of January 5, 2011.

The incident began after agents responded to reports of a group of people trying to smuggle suspected drug packages across the border, the department said. The group, among them Barron, then pelted the agents with rocks, forcing them to take cover.

An independent investigation concluded that the agent fired the fatal shot after Barron ignored commands in Spanish to stop throwing rocks. A videotape of the incident captured Barron making a "throwing motion with his right arm, then falling to the ground," the department said in a news release.

No charges were brought because the department "lacks jurisdiction" to prosecute the agent under a criminal civil rights use of force statute that "requires that the victim be in the United States when he was injured," it said.

Over the past five years, U.S. border agents have fired into Mexico at least 10 times, killing six Mexicans, according to a report released earlier this year by the Washington Monthly and the Investigative Fund at The Nation Institute.

In another Border Patrol shooting incident in Nogales in October, 16-year-old Mexican citizen Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez was shot at least seven times from behind after an agent, or agents, opened fire across the border.

Following the shooting, Mexican authorities condemned the U.S. Border Patrol's use of lethal force and called for a timely and transparent investigation, which is continuing.

In a separate report released on Friday, the Justice Department said it would not pursue charges against another Border Patrol agent who shot and killed a 19-year-old U.S. citizen in the border city of Douglas, Arizona, in March 2011.

Douglas police officers had earlier spotted Carlos LaMadrid loading suspected drug bundles into a truck. LaMadrid then fled south in the truck toward the border, striking a Border Patrol agent's vehicle, before scrambling up a ladder placed against the border fence, the report said.

The unidentified agent opened fire after another man on top of the fence began throwing "brick sized rocks." LaMadrid, who got "in the line of fire" between the agent and the rock thrower, was struck by four bullets and later died in hospital, it said.

In that case, the department said, a careful and thorough review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to pursue homicide or criminal civil rights charges against the agent.

hour commute as early as Monday.

Democratic Governor Jerry Brown's move came as managers for the rail system, dubbed BART, and its unions were still tens of millions of dollars apart on contract terms despite several months of negotiations.

"I urge all parties to think of the public and resolve this matter without delay, but if there's no resolution by Sunday, I will seek a 60-day cooling-off period," Brown said in a statement.

Brown temporarily blocked a strike last week to avert what would have been the second walkout this summer. A strike on Monday would cause rush-hour traffic chaos in the state's second-largest metropolitan area.

BART's management said on Wednesday it could take two months to reach a contract, while unions said they could settle by Sunday. A negotiator for one of BART's unions has said a strike notice on Friday remained an option.

"In the event that negotiations fail, we may issue a 48-hour notice," Josie Mooney of SEIU 1021 said in a statement on Thursday. The sides had yet to emerge from talks on Friday.

Brown said that a panel he appointed to investigate the labor dispute had determined that a strike would cause "significant harm to the public's health, safety and welfare."

Brown said if the two sides fail to resolve their dispute over the weekend, he would seek an order on Sunday morning from the San Francisco Superior Court to block a strike.

If granted, the order would keep about 2,600 BART employees on the job and keep the trains that carry 400,000 riders a day running for at least 60 days.

BART's unions shut the system down last month for four and a half days, forcing passengers to work from home, drive, carpool or crowd onto a limited number of buses and ferries for prolonged, frustrating commutes.

"It's simply not possible to replace BART should another strike occur," BART General Manager Grace Crunican said.

BART management have said they offered workers a 9 percent pay raise over four years. The unions said they want raises of 5 percent per year over three years and that additional pay increases would be needed to offset higher benefit contributions workers are being asked to take on.

BIGGER SHARE OF BENEFIT EXPENSES

BART managers also want employees to pay 5 percent of their pay toward pensions, to which workers currently do not contribute. The move by BART is in line with trends across the nation, with public-sector employees being required to pay more toward pension and other benefits.

Unions said they were $56 million apart from management on contract terms over three years; BART management pegged the gap over the same period at $62 million.

BART management says the average employee gets an annual salary of $79,500 plus $50,800 in benefits, and it is concerned the cost of benefits will continue to climb after increasing by nearly 200 percent in 10 years.

"We're trying to play catch-up," BART spokeswoman Alicia Trost said.

Union representatives peg salaries of BART workers at $64,000 on average, saying that management's figures included higher salaries for managers.

"We are not ashamed to be bargaining to defend a middle-class wage and benefit package," union attorney Vincent Harrington said.

Rating agencies are looking past the dispute. Moody's Investors Service's analyst Eric Hoffmann said BART finances can withstand a strike of moderate length. Moody's rates the district's general obligation debt Aaa.

Standard &amp; Poor's rates the district's general obligation bonds AAA with a stable outlook. Although BART would lose fare revenue during a strike, funds for paying general obligation and revenue bond debt would not be directly affected, S&P; analyst Alda Mostofi said.

BART has about $411 million in outstanding general obligation bonds backed by a property tax and approximately $742 million in outstanding debt backed by sales taxes and fares.

BART, which has an annual budget of $1.5 billion, gets about $215 million a year from sales-tax revenue, which more than covers its $53 million annual debt service on its revenue bonds.

Fitch Ratings has an AA rating on the district's most recent sales tax revenue bonds and rates its general obligation bonds AA-plus. "We describe (the district) as having a solid financial profile," said Fitch analyst Matt Reilly.

week session, the law firm representing him said on Friday.

"Upon completion of the treatment program, Mayor Filner is planning to continue therapy sessions on an outpatient basis," according to a statement from Orange County-based Payne &amp; Fears. "Mayor Filner is taking personal time next week and will be unavailable for comment."

Filner would complete his treatment on Saturday, according to the statement. Earlier in the week his staff confirmed he began his two-week treatment as planned on Monday August 5.

Filner's staff did not return calls Friday to ask about the mayor's whereabouts.

The announcement is the latest twist in a scandal that began three weeks ago with anonymous allegations of inappropriate behavior with female staff floated by a former city councilwoman and two lawyers.

The allegations included one-sided flirtatious behavior, unwanted kissing, and inappropriate touching. Filner apologized and admitted he had disrespected women, and begged for the chance to become a better person.

The following week, lawyer Gloria Allred filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the city and Filner on behalf of her client, Irene McCormack Jackson, Filner's former press secretary.

Jackson's allegations included that the mayor suggested she would do better work while not wearing panties. Within days, the city attorney filed suit against Filner, demanding that he pay his own attorney fees and any judgment that came out of the suit.

Filner then promised to go into behavioral treatment and set a starting date of August 5. In the meantime, at least 14 women have come forward, alleging Filner inappropriately patted or kissed them, grabbed their buttocks or asked them out on dates.

Opponents have launched a recall campaign while the whole city council, plus a number of elected officials at the state legislature and at the federal level have called on Filner to resign. The San Diego County Democratic Party has also demanded his resignation.



headline: Fire crews tighten grip on California blaze as evacuations lifted
byline: By Steve Gorman
8:31am EDT

driven blaze roaring for a third day through dry brush east of Los Angeles as evacuation orders were lifted on Friday for hundreds of homes, but the tally of property losses climbed higher.

The so-called Silver Fire erupted south of the Riverside County town of Banning and by Friday evening had charred some 17,500 acres on the rugged northern and eastern slopes of Jan Jacinto Mountain, authorities said.

Four firefighters suffered minor injuries, and a civilian was severely burned in the blaze, which has raged since Wednesday through tinder-dry scrub land and grass about 85 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, officials said.

As of Friday morning, a firefighting force of more than 1,600, backed by a squadron of water-dropping helicopters and a team of bulldozers, had managed to carve fire breaks around 25 percent of the blaze's perimeter, up from 10 percent a day earlier.

"We're definitely making very good progress," California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Daniel Berlandt said.

Another CalFire spokesman, Kevin Lucero, said efforts to subdue the flames were helped by diminishing winds on Friday, after two days of gusty conditions that had fanned the fire's rapid growth.

The blaze, one of dozens burning across several western states, is the latest to unleash significant property losses during a U.S. summer fire season that experts predict could become one of the worst on record.

Residents of more than 500 homes had been forced to flee their dwellings at the peak of the blaze, but evacuation orders for the bulk of those communities, about 20 miles west of the desert resort of Palm Springs, were lifted on Friday evening as the fire threat subsided.

An evacuation remained in effect for a nearby mobile home park and a small enclave called Twin Pines. Several campgrounds in the area have also been closed.

The cause of the fire remained under investigation.

Some residents within the evacuation zone were initially advised to stay put in their homes as approaching flames cut them off from a safe escape route on Wednesday, but those evacuees were later moved out of harm's way, Berlandt said.

The toll of documented property damage from the fire was revised upward on Friday, to 26 homes and a commercial building destroyed from 15 structures lost, county fire officials said. Two other homes were listed as damaged.

"Hundreds of homes ... are still standing because of the aggressive efforts of those firefighters," Berlandt said, adding that the majority of dwellings threatened by the blaze have so far been protected.

The Silver Fire was burning on the opposite side of San Jacinto Mountain from where an earlier fire threatened the resort town of Idyllwild last month, destroying several homes and forcing the evacuation of about 6,000 residents, tourists and business owners.

Earlier this year, a Colorado wildfire that ranked as that state's most destructive on record ravaged nearly 500 homes and killed two people. In Arizona, 19 members of an elite firefighting crew died on June 30 while battling a wildfire.



headline: Activists to light candles, pray for American jailed in North Korea
byline: By Eric M. Johnson
8:31am EDT

Family and friends seeking the release of an American Christian missionary imprisoned in North Korea will hold at least two prayer vigils on Saturday, seeking to raise his global profile and spur clemency pleas, his sister said.

Kenneth Bae was sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor after North Korea's Supreme Court convicted him of state subversion. It said the 45-year-old had used his tourism business to form groups to overthrow the government.

Bae was detained in November as he led a tour group through the northern region of the country. His sentencing came amid acrimonious relations between Pyongyang and Washington over the reclusive state's nuclear program.

Members of Bae's family and the broader community will light candles and pray for Bae at a Seattle church on Saturday evening and will read from a letter he sent home from prison, his sister, Terri Chung, said.

"This is the time. We must appeal to our legislative leaders to act and seek amnesty for Kenneth," Chung said.

Two American journalists arrested in 2009 by North Korea and held until former President Bill Clinton traveled there to negotiate their release are organizing a satellite vigil in New York, one of the journalists, Euna Lee said.

Bae spends eight hours a day, six days a week planting and plowing fields of potatoes and beans among other work at a prison for foreigners near Pyongyang where he is kept largely isolated, Chung said, adding that his health was deteriorating.

North Korea has in the past used the release of high-profile American prisoners as a means of garnering a form of prestige or acceptance by portraying visiting dignitaries as paying homage to the country and its leader.

That pattern has complicated the response of U.S. lawmakers and the State Department, which has called for Bae's immediate release on "humanitarian grounds," but resisted sending high-profile envoys to negotiate, as it has done in the past.

An Internet petition started by Bae's son urging U.S. President Barack Obama to secure a "Special Amnesty" for Bae has garnered nearly 8,000 signatures.

There have been other calls for his release, such as a Twitter message from former basketball player Dennis Rodman, who visited North Korea in February, but Chung said U.S. officials have assured her they are pursuing quieter clemency efforts.

Reports last month that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was set to visit North Korea to negotiate for Bae were ultimately denied as false.

Bae, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Korea who moved to the United States with his family in 1985, has spent much of the last seven years in China, where he started a business leading tour groups into the northern region of North Korea, Chung said.

Chung said she hopes to learn more about the nature of those visits. Human rights activists in South Korea say Bae may have been arrested for taking pictures of starving children.

"I believe his personal convictions as a Christian might not have been interpreted kindly," Chung told Reuters in a recent interview.

old female student in one of their dorm rooms this summer, police said on Friday.

The suspects, who were kicked off the football team and banned from campus following the allegations, were charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of sexual battery, according to Nashville police spokesman Don Aaron.

Police arrested one of the men, Corey Batey, 19, of Nashville, on Friday afternoon. Aaron said Batey was taken to a hospital for mandatory HIV testing before being held on a $350,000 bond.

Aaron identified the others as Brandon Vandenburg, 20, of Indio, California; Brandon Banks, 19, of Brandywine, Maryland; and Jaborian McKenzie, 19, of Woodville, Mississippi.

Vandenburg, in whose room the rapes are said to have occurred, was also was charged with tampering with evidence and unlawful photography.

Aaron said police have contacted authorities in the states where the other men live. He encouraged them to come to Nashville and turn themselves in.

The incident allegedly took place in Vandenburg's dorm room in the early hours of June 23, but was not immediately reported.

"The matter first came to light the next week when university officials checking the dorm's hallway surveillance recordings regarding an unrelated situation observed concerning behavior by the defendants," according to a police press release.

The university's police force contacted the city police on June 26, which led to Friday's indictments.

District Attorney General Torry Johnson said the investigation was ongoing and that other people may be implicated in the attack.

"We are shocked and saddened by the allegations that such an assault has taken place on our campus and that they include members of our football team," said Beth Fortune, Vanderbilt vice chancellor for public affairs, reading from a prepared statement.

This is the latest in a series of alleged incidents of sexual assault involving college football players. In June three U.S. Naval Academy football players were charged with raping a female midshipman at an off-campus party in April 2012.

In May the U.S. Justice Department struck a deal with the University of Montana in which the school pledged to change the way it responds to rape accusations.

A federal review listed at least 11 reported sexual assaults since 2010 involving University of Montana students, several of whom were members of the football team.

San Francisco area commuter rail workers were threatening to strike again, saying they could stop work as early as Monday unless a deal with management can be reached or California's governor steps in to intervene, with the sides still tens of millions of dollars apart on contract terms.

Governor Jerry Brown temporarily blocked a strike last week and is weighing whether to seek a court order for a "cooling off" period by Sunday to again avert what would be a second walkout this summer. A strike on Monday would hit rush-hour, causing traffic chaos in the state's second-largest metropolitan area.

headline: No bond for Miami man who confessed on Facebook to killing of wife

8:31am EDT

The Florida man who confessed to fatally shooting his wife and posted a grisly picture of her bloodied corpse on Facebook was ordered held without bail on Friday after he was arrested on a murder charge.

Derek Medina, shackled and wearing a short-sleeved green prison outfit, appeared before Miami Judge Maria Elena Verde by video link a day after the death of his wife, Jennifer Alfonso.

He was ordered held without bond pending his arraignment in 21 days, and could face a death sentence if he is convicted of first degree murder.

Medina, 31, gained notoriety on Thursday when he wrote in a Facebook posting that he had just shot and killed 26-year-old Alfonso because she was punching and physically abusing him. The posting was accompanied by a photo of her lifeless body on the floor.

Medina wrote to his "friends" on Facebook, "I'm going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife. Love you guys, Miss you guys ... My wife was punching me, and I am not going to stand any more with the abuse so I did what I did. I hope u understand me."

The author of six online books on topics that include marriage counseling, Medina had been employed as a front desk supervisor on the overnight shift at a luxury Miami-area condominium.

Detective Javier Baez of the Miami-Dade Police Department, confirmed the authenticity of Medina's Facebook posting, which remained public for hours before it was removed late on Thursday.

Medina's arrest affidavit said that he confessed to shooting Alfonso multiple times after a verbal dispute that turned violent when she began kicking him and punching him with a closed fist. Medina told police that Alfonso said she was leaving him. A copy of the affidavit was obtained by Reuters.

The couple married in 2010, divorced in early 2012, then remarried a few months later. Medina's father was quoted by local media as saying the relationship had always been difficult.

Medina told police that Alfonso had armed herself with a knife during their argument, but he said that was after he had gone to his bedroom for a gun with which he confronted her.

According to the affidavit, after Medina knew that Alfonso was dead, he changed his clothes and went to his parents, then turned himself in to police.

driven blaze roaring for a third day through dry brush east of Los Angeles, even as property losses climbed on Friday to more than two dozen homes while hundreds more remained threatened.

The so-called Silver Fire erupted on Wednesday south of the Riverside County town of Banning and by early Friday had charred some 16,000 acres on the rugged northern and eastern slopes of Jan Jacinto Mountain, authorities said.

Four firefighters suffered minor injuries, and a civilian was severely burned in the blaze, which was raging through tinder-dry scrub land and grass about 85 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, officials said.

More than 500 homes in several communities remained under mandatory evacuation orders, including portions of Cabazon, a town of 2,500 residents about 20 miles west of the desert resort of Palm Springs.

Several campgrounds in the area have also been closed, and shelters for evacuees were been set up at high schools in nearby Hemet and Beaumont. The cause of the fire remained under investigation.

Some residents within the evacuation zone were initially advised to stay put in their homes as approaching flames cut them off from a safe escape route on Wednesday, but those evacuees were later moved out of harm's way, Berlandt said.

Two bodies have been located after a small plane crashed into two houses in East Haven, Connecticut, on Friday, and the death toll could rise, Governor Dannel Malloy said.

Emergency workers have "visuals" on two bodies in the basement of one of the houses, the governor told reporters.

The twin-engine propeller plane had been attempting to land at nearby Tweed New Haven Airport in rainy weather.

Earlier, East Haven Deputy Fire Chief Tony Moscato said officials believed that at least three people, including the pilot and two children in one of the houses, were missing.

Emergency crews were not certain if there were other people on the plane with the pilot, and the destruction at the scene made the workers' job more difficult, the governor said.

"This is a disaster site," Malloy said. "There's a lot of damage."

Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration were on the scene.

Police cordoned off the area, where smoke could be seen rising from between the houses, and pieces of the plane's wing were visible in the wreckage. Part of the roof of one of the houses had collapsed.



headline: Suspect in California murder-kidnap, girl believed seen in Idaho
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

Horseback riders returning from the remote Idaho wilderness have told police they may have encountered a California man suspected of killing a longtime friend and kidnapping at least one of her children, the San Diego County sheriff said on Friday.

The riders told police that on Wednesday they came across fugitive James Lee DiMaggio backpacking in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness northeast of Boise with a teenage girl who might have been the 16-year-old he is accused of abducting, Sheriff William Gore said.

The group said they spoke briefly with the man and his young companion and realized only after returning from their excursion that night and seeing news reports that they may have encountered DiMaggio, 40, and his alleged victim.

The horseback riders said the two appeared to be in good health, and there was no indication the girl was in distress or being held against her will.

"They did seem to think the two of them were out of place in that area, with the light camping equipment they had," Gore said. "It is very ... rugged terrain."

Police acting on the sighting on Thursday morning found a blue Nissan Versa belonging to DiMaggio near a trailhead about five miles away, covered in brush and with the license plates removed, Gore said.

DiMaggio is wanted in the killing of Christina Anderson, 44, and in the disappearance of her two children, 16-year-old Hannah and 8-year-old Ethan, all of whom were last seen on Saturday, the day before he is suspected of setting his own house on fire.

Since then, DiMaggio has been the subject of a massive manhunt. Authorities have issued child-abduction alerts across the U.S. West and notified authorities in Canada and Mexico to watch for the fugitive and either of the Anderson children.

San Diego County Sheriff's Captain Duncan Fraser said that the camping gear being used by DiMaggio and the girl had been purchased several weeks earlier.

"We believe this was a planned event. The information we're working with now tells us that this was planned," Fraser said.

The computer technician has been described as a longtime friend of the Anderson family who was like an uncle to the children.

REMOTE AREA

The Sheriff's Department in Ada County, Idaho, said investigators from multiple agencies were en route to the mountainous area where the horseback riders believe they came across DiMaggio and Hannah Anderson.

Sheriff's officials declined to say if explosives were found rigged to the car, as police had cautioned they might be.

"This is a very remote section of land that is not easily accessible. Because of that, gathering credible information from the scene will take some time - likely several hours," the Ada County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.

"Teams are stationed at multiple access points around the wilderness area to monitor any people coming in or out. At this time, the location of Hannah Anderson, Ethan Anderson and James DiMaggio is not known," the sheriff's office said.

Two people trying to pack into the Idaho backcountry with light camping gear and supplies could be ill-equipped to master the challenges of the intensely rugged terrain, said Chris Grove, district ranger with the Salmon-Challis National Forest, which oversees the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness.

Nighttime temperatures in the high country are already dropping below freezing and cross-country travelers will face numerous obstacles on trails like large, fallen trees and steep grades that may lead to nowhere, Grove said.

"The path you may choose may take you to a cliff or a river like the Middle Fork that is difficult to cross," he said of an area known for forested peaks, sheer canyons and whitewater rapids.

In California, police have not revealed how Christina Anderson was killed. They have said a child's body found in DiMaggio's burned-out home in the San Diego County community of Boulevard may be that of Ethan Anderson, but that more time was required for a positive identification.

The children's father, Brett Anderson, who now lives in Tennessee, has said he presumes the body is that of his son. He pleaded with DiMaggio in a televised message this week to let his daughter go and advised the teenager to make a run for it.

Authorities have said they have no evidence of a precipitating incident or circumstances that might have led to the crimes DiMaggio is suspected of committing.

headline: Wounded soldiers tell trial of surviving Fort Hood massacre
byline: By Karen Brooks
8:31am EDT

Victims of the 2009 Fort Hood massacre told tales of survival on Friday, of living through shots to the head and destroyed organs, crawling with paralyzed legs and running with bullets lodged in their backs, their knees and their feet.

Soldiers testified in the court-martial of U.S. Army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan, who admits killing 13 people and wounding 31 others at the U.S. Army base in Texas on November 5, 2009, just days before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan.

Staff Sergeant Patrick Ziegler said he heard a man scream "Allahu Akbar" ("God is greatest" in Arabic), then saw the red laser sight of Hasan's handgun cross his vision.

"Then a split-second later, it felt like somebody hit me in the head with a metal baseball bat," Ziegler said.

Blood pouring from his head, he managed to crawl a short distance before blacking out. He recalled waking up in an ambulance and telling the paramedic he felt nauseated. Later he discovered he had been shot four times, including once to the right side of his skull.

Hasan, a U.S.-born Muslim, told the jury on the opening day of testimony on Tuesday that "I am the shooter" and that he "switched sides" in what he called a U.S. war on Islam.

Another survivor, Staff Sergeant Shawn Manning, said he lay on the ground playing dead, struck by six bullets including one to the chest. He recalled thinking his time was running out.

"I figured that the shooter would finish me off if he saw that I was still alive," Manning said. "At that time I could feel my lung starting to collapse and fill full of fluid, and as a medic I knew that if the scene wasn't safe and if I didn't get medical treatment right away, I would most likely drown in my own blood in my lung."

'THROWING A CHAIR'

Soldiers were unable to fire back because they are prohibited from carrying weapons on base. Military police eventually shot Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down and attends court in a wheelchair.

"I had thought about possibly throwing a chair at the shooter, and I saw somebody else do that and watched them get shot, so I decided at that time it wasn't really a smart idea," Staff Sergeant Joy Clark said.

Richard Rosen, law professor at Texas Tech University, said the testimony about how Hasan shot soldiers on the ground, multiple times and as they tried to flee, was apparently the prosecutors' attempt to show that the killings were intentional and premeditated.

"They're going to try to prove by circumstantial evidence that Hasan intended to kill these people," Rosen said. "And the fact that some didn't die was through no fault of Hasan's."

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges against Hasan, who could face the death penalty if all 13 officers on the jury find him guilty of premeditated murder. The U.S. military has not executed a service member since 1961.

Hasan has not questioned any of the victims or rescuers, allaying concerns about the emotional distress survivors might feel if he cross-examined them.

He interjected once to ask the judge to remind a witness she was under oath, and objected to one witness detailing the extent of his medical care after being shot.

The judge sustained his objection, agreeing the testimony was suitable only for the phase of the trial to determine the penalty, not the guilt or innocence phase.



headline: Third man sentenced in New Jersey hate-crime beating
byline: By David Jones
8:31am EDT

A third white supremacist was sentenced to nearly three years in prison on Friday for a 2011 attack on two New Jersey men of Egyptian descent.

Christopher Ising, 31, a member of the largest skinhead group in New Jersey, the Atlantic City Skins, pleaded guilty in February to committing a hate-crime assault and conspiracy to do so.

Ising hosted two members of another white supremacist group, the Aryan Terror Brigade, at his home in Wareton on December 31, 2011, where they drank alcohol, listened to white supremacist music and plotted attacks on random non-white victims, prosecutors said.

They drove to an apartment complex in Sayreville, New Jersey, where Ising punched one victim with brass knuckles, causing puncture wounds behind his left ear, according to prosecutors.

Michael Gunar brandished a knife and pulled another man out of a car, punching him and shouting anti-Arab slurs, they said.

At a hearing in Trenton, U.S. District Judge Joel Pisano sentenced Ising to 33 months in federal prison.

The same judge sentenced Gunar, 29, to 33 months in prison and Kyle Powell, 24, to 15 months on Wednesday. Gunar pleaded guilty to the same charges as Ising, while Powell pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit a hate-crime assault.

Ising's attorney Maria Noto expressed gratitude for the sentence and said her client, a construction worker who has been locked up in a county jail, has changed his views.

"Christopher has accepted his responsibility for his actions and deeply regrets his involvement in the incident," Noto said in a telephone phone interview. "I would not expect Christopher to have any further involvement with any of the groups to which he may have been involved with in the past."

According to the Anti-Defamation League, the Atlantic City Skins is the largest racist skinhead group in New Jersey, with about 40 members.

In 2008, a member of the group, Walter Dille Jr., was convicted in a botched carjacking murder of a black woman in Hamilton Township, New Jersey.



headline: Investigators searching for girl missing for 66 years end Wisconsin dig

old girl halted their excavation of a Janesville vacant lot on Friday after five days of digging turned up no human remains, police said.

Investigators received a tip on July 30 that Georgia Jean Weckler might be buried there and trained dogs indicated that human remains could be present, Jefferson County Sheriff's Captain Jerry Haferman said. It was the first tip in the case since 1999.

Janesville police, Rock County sheriff's detectives and the Jefferson County sheriff's office started digging on Monday. A house is soon to be built on the lot, but at the time Weckler went missing the area was rural and partially wooded with gravel roads. Janesville is in Rock County, near where the Wecklers lived in Jefferson County.

"We didn't find anything and we are done digging," Haferman said.

Rock County Sheriff's Captain Todd Christiansen said about 30 people started the dig and half that number worked on Friday to wrap it up. Searchers mapped out 24 grids measuring roughly 10 feet by 10 feet, and used hand tools to remove earth and sift it for human remains, Christiansen said.

Investigators, who have not identified the person who gave them the tip, plan to meet with the tipster again next week, Christiansen said.

Weckler was last seen on May 1, 1947, when a friend's mother dropped her at the entrance to her family's farm about a half mile from her house, Haferman said.

He said one of her friends recalled Weckler saying she was going to pick flowers and remembered seeing her take mail from the family's mailbox.

Thousands of people searched for Weckler after she disappeared and several reported seeing a dark-colored 1936 Ford sedan in the area, Haferman said.

Investigators have checked several tips and some confessions over the years, but none were confirmed, he said.



headline: Photo of snoozing officer in most violent U.S. city sparks probe
byline: By Daniel Kelley
8:31am EDT

A photo of a police officer in Camden, New Jersey, apparently asleep in his cruiser has prompted an investigation in the U.S. city with the nation's highest violent crime rate in 2012.

The photo, which shows the uniformed officer wearing sunglasses, head cocked back and mouth agape in the driver's seat, began circulating on Camden-related Facebook pages this week.

It was unclear whether the officer was napping or caught yawning at a bad moment, whether he was on break or on duty, or how long he had been on patrol.

"It's under investigation," Michael Daniels, spokesman for the Camden County Police Department, said on Friday. He declined to identify the officer.

Camden has scrapped its city police force as a cost-saving measure, and the county force replaced it in May.

CQ Press, which tabulates crime data, ranked Camden, a city of 77,000 people across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, as the U.S. city with the highest violent crime rate in 2012.

The county police department said it has already reduced crime, citing a 91 percent drop in daytime homicides - down to one from 11 in the same period last year.

But Camden's safer streets come at a cost to county officers, who work 12-hour overnight shifts, said Tracey Hall, a retired Camden city police officer who has criticized the county department's working conditions.

"Coming in at midnight when it's dark, and working into the afternoon, it's hard on the officer's body," Hall said. "We go from zero to 60 every other call. Eight hours in Camden is like working 16 hours anywhere else."

headline: New York Mayor Bloomberg fights to preserve law-and-order legacy
byline: By Francesca Trianni
8:31am EDT

Mayor Michael Bloomberg is fighting to preserve his legacy on law and order, working behind the scenes to win over the New York City Council as the final months run out on his 12 years in office.

Bloomberg made fighting crime a hallmark of his time in office. After succeeding Mayor Rudy Giuliani less than two months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, Bloomberg pressed ahead with aggressive police tactics that have reduced crime but drawn criticism from civil liberties groups.

Those policies have also come under fire from left-leaning mayoral hopefuls and the city council.

Now Bloomberg, relegated to the sidelines of November's mayoral election as he completes his final 4-year term as mayor, has undertaken a campaign of pressuring city council members to reverse their votes on police oversight and racial profiling.

Much of the campaign has involved phone calls placed to council members from top officials of the mayor's office, according to six sources with direct knowledge of the conversations. In one case, a candidate said he was recruited by the mayor's office to run against a Queens council member who refused to change his vote.

The New York mayor's office has acknowledged its lobbying of city council members but declined to comment on its role in recruiting a challenger for the Queens race.

The city council defied Bloomberg by passing two laws in June. One creates an independent inspector general to monitor the New York Police Department, and the other expands the definition of racial profiling and allows people who believe they have been profiled to sue police in state court.

Bloomberg vetoed the bills in July, challenging the council to override him with a two-thirds majority vote. The inspector general bill passed by 40-11, meaning seven council members would have to change their vote. But the racial profiling bill passed by 34-17, meaning only one of those 34 council members would need to switch sides to uphold the veto.

A vote on the veto has been set for August 22.

In a show of force, the mayor has been lobbying at least three council members to convince them to withdraw their support from the bills, according to more than a dozen people involved who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the matter.

"They're using the power of persuasion at their disposal," said Peter Vallone Jr., a council member representing parts of Queens, referring to the Bloomberg administration. Vallone sided with Bloomberg and voted against both bills.

Bloomberg has cited pro-active police tactics for helping reduce homicides from 649 in 2001, the year he was elected, to a record low of 419 in 2012. Other major felonies have fallen by similar proportions.

"The mayor has been very clear about why these bills are bad for public safety, and we will continue to make our case to council members leading up to the override vote," said John McCarthy, a spokesman for the mayor's office.

Bloomberg's efforts to overturn the bills were "highly unusual" and part of a wider effort by the mayor to leave his mark on a city he has governed for over a decade, said Doug Muzzio, a political science professor at Baruch College.

"The Bloomberg legacy has to stand on a couple of pillars: one is education, the second thing is public safety," Muzzio said. "Clearly, Bloomberg is using all of his political muscle."

CIVIL BUT SERIOUS CALLS

In one instance, the mayor's top aides made last-minute efforts to find a candidate to run against Queens City Councilman Mark Weprin in retaliation for his support of the two bills, said a source close to the Weprin campaign who is not authorized to speak about the matter and asked not to be identified.

Weprin said he was not contacted by the mayor's office about changing his vote.

The former police officer who was recruited to run against Weprin, Joseph Concannon, said he decided to run only after the profiling bills were passed.

"The mayor and I champion wiping this law off the books," Concannon told Reuters. Concannon, who announced his candidacy on Thursday, said he had been prodded by the mayor's staff to run.

"We had conversations," he said.

McCarthy and Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson did not respond to queries about encouraging Concannon to challenge Weprin.

Weprin said he tried to reach out to the mayor's office to verify the involvement of officials. "They never returned any of my calls."

Other council members have received phone calls from top aides in the mayor's office urging them to uphold the vetoes and thus overturn the laws.

The calls were "serious" in tone but "civil," said one source with direct knowledge of the conversations who did not want to be identified for fear of retribution.

Among those who received phone calls were three Democratic council members - Mathieu Eugene, Sara Gonzalez and Erik Dilan - said sources with direct knowledge of the conversations but who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak about the matter.

Bloomberg, who will step down on January 1, is still able to reward those who support him, said Jumaane Williams, the lead sponsor of the racial profiling and inspector general bills.

"Where possible, they have promised them a lot of things; where possible, they have threatened them; where possible, they tried to find people to run against them," Williams said, declining to be more specific.

Eugene, a Brooklyn council member who is seeking re-election, received up to 10 phone calls in the past two weeks "that were serious but not nasty" and "explained their reasoning to change the vote," said a source close to the Eugene campaign who did not want to be identified because the matter is not public.



headline: 'Whitey' Bulger jury gets weekend off, no verdict yet
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

The U.S. jury hearing the murder and racketeering trial of James "Whitey" Bulger ended a fourth day of deliberations on Friday without reaching a verdict on charges that could leave the former mob boss in jail for the rest of his life.

Bulger, 83, faces a sweeping 32-count indictment that also charges him with extortion, money laundering and drug trafficking dating back to his years running Boston's feared Winter Hill crime gang in the 1970s and '80s.

U.S. District Judge Denise Capser dismissed the eight men and four women on the jury for the weekend. The panel will return to Boston's waterfront courthouse on Monday to resume deliberations.

About a dozen family members of people Bulger is accused of killing were camped out at the courthouse awaiting a verdict. Some played cards in the courthouse's cafeteria on Friday.

Bulger, who inspired the character played by Jack Nicholson in Martin Scorsese's 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed" has pleaded not guilty to all charges. His attorneys did concede he was a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark, in essence an "organized criminal."

Casper has urged the jury to reach unanimous verdicts on all the charges, including 19 murders Bulger is accused of committing or ordering in the 1970s and '80s.

Prosecutors on Friday lodged a protest with the judge about comments made a day earlier by defense attorney J.W. Carney to reporters outside the courthouse.

Carney had praised jurors for their diligence. The comments were reported in the Boston Herald newspaper under the headline: "Whitey's lawyers praise diligent jury."

Carney had also removed his shoes and showed reporters his purple-painted toenails, but prosecutors did not object to that display.

"It is one thing if Mr. Carney wants to discuss his strange personal habits with the media but we can't have headlines like these," Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Kelly told the judge.

Bulger's eight-week trial brought back memories of an era in Boston when machine-gun toting gangsters assassinated rivals, shook down fellow criminals and local business owners. Prosecutors said corrupt FBI agents sharing Bulger's Irish ethnicity turned a blind eye to his gang's crimes in exchange for information they could use against the Italian Mafia.

But Bulger, along with pleading not guilty to the crimes he was charged with, insisted he also was not "a rat."

His story has long fascinated Boston. Bulger rose from a housing project to become one of the most feared men in the city at the same time as his brother William served as the powerful president of the state senate.

After decades atop the city's criminal underworld, Bulger fled after a 1994 tip from corrupt FBI agent John Connolly. He eluded authorities for 16 years, part of that time listed on the bureau's "Ten Most Wanted" list of fugitives. In June 2011, Agents caught up with him living in a seaside apartment in Santa Monica, California, with his girlfriend.

The officer who arrested him recalled the words from the mobster that ended the long mystery of his whereabouts: "You know who I am. I'm 'Whitey' Bulger."

A New Jersey woman has been charged with submitting fraudulent injury claims to a charity set up to aid victims of the Boston Marathon terrorist bombings, prosecutors said on Friday.

Union County prosecutors said Iris Gamble, 44, of Linden, N.J., submitted a false claim with the One Fund Boston, which was established after the April 15 bombing attack that killed three and injured about 264 people, mainly spectators crowded at the finish line.

Gamble is the third person charged with filing false claims for benefits from the fund, which has raised more than $60 million for victims of the largest mass-casualty attack on U.S. soil since the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Gamble submitted the claims on June 11, claiming to have been treated at a Newark hospital for injuries sustained in the bombing. However, the application was flagged due to misspellings and other irregularities, prosecutors said. The Massachusetts attorney general forwarded the case to Union County officials.

"Our investigation revealed that the defendant was not in Boston on the day of the bombings," said acting Union County Prosecutor Grace Park. "The defendant wasted little time in trying to profit from the generosity and kindness of others."

Gamble was charged on Thursday with third degree theft by deception, fourth degree fraud and fourth degree creating fraudulent documents. Her first appearance in Union County Superior Court is scheduled for August 16th.

She could not be reached for comment on Friday.

Last month, a Troy, N.Y., woman was charged with larceny after fraudulently receiving nearly $480,000 in benefits from the fund, claiming she suffered a traumatic brain injury. A Boston man was arrested in July for submitting a false $2 million claim on behalf of his aunt.

About 250 people have applied for money from the One Fund charity, set up to benefit the families of those killed and those who lost limbs in the blasts.



headline: Oregon delays wide access to Obamacare insurance exchange
byline: By Sharon Begley
8:31am EDT

The online insurance exchange that Oregon established under President Barack Obama's healthcare law will not allow residents to sign up for coverage on their own when enrollment begins nationwide on October 1, state officials say.

The state is the first to say it won't be open for all comers by that date, raising concerns that other states running their own "Obamacare" exchanges might also be struggling.

The decision by Oregon, an enthusiastic supporter of the Affordable Care Act, gives ammunition to opponents who have warned of an Obamacare "train wreck."

Instead of enrolling in health insurance online themselves, at least through mid-October Oregonians will need the help of an insurance broker or an aide trained by the state to log on, Cover Oregon spokeswoman Lisa Morawski said on Friday.

They also will need assistance to see what policies are available, and to determine which federal subsidies they might be eligible for.

"This approach will give Cover Oregon the ability to iron out the technology, customer service and other internal processes during the first few weeks of October before consumers begin applying on their own," Morawski said. "It also will prevent the system from being overloaded in its first weeks."

Experts working with the state exchanges, as well as the Government Accountability Office and the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), have warned that the massive effort to build new online insurance marketplaces in all 50 states may not be ready by October 1.

Efforts to get people without health insurance to buy a policy through their state exchange, as required under the Affordable Care Act, have emphasized that the process would be fast and easy: log on, enter personal information such as address and income, and in real time the system would show you a list of available policies and tell you what they would cost after federal subsidies.

HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said, "There will be a marketplace open in every state on October 1, where families can comparison shop for quality, affordable health coverage."

The delay, Cover Oregon chief information officer Aaron Karjala told Reuters, reflects "concerns about the capacity of the exchange as a whole, not just the technology but also the people."

"We're not worried about IT capacity," he said. "We have enough to run the stock exchange."

Instead, officials worry that too many people trying to enroll in coverage will phone the state's Obamacare call center, which has about 50 full-time employees and plans for up to 100 more.

About 550,000 state residents are uninsured.

"The largest choke point and the biggest constraint is the limited number of people in the call center," Karjala said. "People might need a lot of help" when they try to enroll, "which could mean fairly long calls."

Oregon has trained about 1,000 agents and about 800 community partners, Morawski said. Each will be given a secured account allowing them to log on to Cover Oregon and help someone buy insurance.

"This strikes me as something that most states probably would want to do, because they don't want bad stories in the press about how the exchange didn't work and people were disappointed - which is virtually inevitable in the early weeks," said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

"So this seems to be a pretty prudent move on Oregon's part. They can say they did everything in their power to avoid leaving Joe Public baffled by an admittedly complicated system."

martial for providing a trove of secret files to WikiLeaks.

Defense lawyers for Manning, who faces up to 90 years in prison, are expected next week to start laying out their case that the former intelligence analyst get a lenient sentence in the biggest leak of secret data in U.S. history.

Manning, 25, was convicted last week of charges that included espionage and theft for releasing more than 700,000 documents, battlefield videos and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, a pro-transparency website.

Rear Admiral Kevin Donegan, operations director from 2010 to 2012 of the U.S. Central Command, which includes Iraq and Afghanistan, testified that a task force was set up to assess the risk and damage for U.S. military forces and their allies.

"This was not a small operation," he said.

The U.S. military tried to warn anyone who could be identified by enemy forces through WikiLeaks that "they were potentially in jeopardy," Donegan said.

WikiLeaks also endangered Afghan villages that might be perceived as friendly toward U.S. or coalition forces, Donegan said.

He added that "there was absolutely an impact" on the U.S. government from the released diplomatic cables.

Under questioning from defense attorney Major Thomas Hurley, Donegan said he was unable to name anyone who became a casualty of reprisal because of the WikiLeaks publications.

The court went into a closed session to hear classified information from Donegan. Major General Kenneth McKenzie, a senior staff member at the Marine Corps headquarters, also testified behind closed doors.

Manning, of Crescent, Oklahoma, was convicted of releasing the files while working as a low-level intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2010. He was found not guilty of the most serious count of aiding the enemy, which carried a sentence of life without parole.

In setting Manning's sentence, Colonel Denise Lind, the military judge who convicted him, is determining how much damage he did.

Manning's lawyers have portrayed him as naive but well-intentioned. They argue the soldier's aim was to provoke a broader debate on U.S. military policy, not to harm anyone.

8:31am EDT

A teacher faced additional murder charges on Friday when he was accused of killing his girlfriend and her daughter in addition to already facing charges of fatally shooting his estranged wife and her daughter.

Erbie Lee Bowser, 44, is accused of murdering the four women during a shooting rampage at two houses late on Wednesday.

The new murder charges are for the deaths of Bowser's girlfriend, Toya Smith, 43, and her daughter, Tasmia Allen, 17, in their southwest Dallas home, police said.

Bowser was charged on Thursday with capital murder for the shooting death of his estranged wife Zina Bowser, 47, and her daughter, Neima Williams, 28, in the Dallas suburb of DeSoto.

If convicted, he could face the death penalty in Texas, which has executed more inmates than any other state. Dallas police said they are recommending a bond of $2.5 million in connection with two of the four murders.

Bowser is also charged with shooting and wounding four other people on Wednesday - three boys ages 11, 13 and 14, and a 17-year-old girl.

All of those killed were believed to have died from gunshot wounds, although police said an explosive device of some kind was also used at the second house.

Zina Bowser, a nurse, had applied for an order of protection against Bowser in January 2011, about a week after she filed for divorce.

As grounds for the order, she said she and her sons once fled the house because Erbie Bowser was threatening her with a knife. During one argument, she picked up the phone to call 911. Erbie Bowser allegedly told her: "Call the police and I will execute your kids."

Bowser was a well-liked special education teacher, in Mesquite, Texas, who resigned in 2010, said a spokeswoman for the Mesquite Independent School District.

The 6-foot-7 Army veteran, who weighs 355 pounds, had been a member of a dance team for the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team but left the squad in 2009, the team said.

U.S. President Barack Obama met with the CEOs of Apple Inc, AT&T; Inc as well as other top technology and privacy representatives on Thursday to discuss government surveillance in the wake of revelations about the programs, the White House confirmed on Friday.

Google Inc computer scientist Vint Cerf and transparency advocates also participated in the meeting, along with Apple's Tim Cook and AT&T;'s Randall Stephenson, according to the White House.

"The meeting was part of the ongoing dialogue the president has called for on how to respect privacy while protecting national security in a digital era," a White House official said in confirming a report by Politico, which broke the news of the meeting.

The closed-door session was not included on Obama's daily public schedule for Thursday. It followed another private session on Tuesday of Obama administration officials, industry lobbyists and privacy advocates.

The meetings follow disclosures about the U.S. government's secret surveillance tactics over emails and telephone data detailed in various media reports from information released by fugitive former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Obama is likely to face questions about the National Security Agency and the government's phone and electronic monitoring at his news conference later on Friday.

Groups invited to Thursday's meeting included Gigi Sohn, the head of the privacy and transparency group Public Knowledge, as well as representatives from other similar organizations such as the Center for Democracy and Technology, the White House said.

Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said the company considers protecting customer data a priority, adding, "we strongly advocate greater transparency around the demands we get from government agencies."

AT&T; declined to comment as did Public Knowledge, which advocates open access to the Internet. Other participants also had no comment or did not return requests for comment on the discussions at the meeting.

'BROAD CONCERN'

Since the NSA's vast data-gathering programs were revealed in June, the president has repeatedly said he would encourage a national conversation on the need for U.S. surveillance while respecting people's right to privacy.

Critics have blasted the administration for the scope of the surveillance and blamed Congress for not carrying out proper oversight. Some lawmakers have vowed to push legislation calling for more accountability for the programs.

Tuesday's session with Obama's chief of staff Denis McDonough, and top Obama lawyer Kathy Ruemmler included representatives from tech lobbying groups Information Technology Industry Council, TechNet and TechAmerica as well as civil liberties groups, the White House confirmed.

"There was broad concern among privacy advocates and the private sector about the impact of the NSA's surveillance efforts. Several of the private sector representatives worried that the international backlash against NSA collection of foreign data would harm American global competitiveness," American Civil Liberties Union President Susan Herman said.

Herman added that despite such meetings, "It's not clear yet that the White House appreciates the need to scale back these surveillance programs substantially instead of just rationalizing or tinkering with them."

Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said his group also attended on Tuesday and wants Obama to reform surveillance law, enact a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, and establish an international framework for privacy protection.

An industry source familiar the earlier meeting also said the talks "reflected the reality of the world in which we live - a digital world in which the economy is driven by data and information crossing borders and oceans almost instantly."

"That reality carries with it challenges that, working collaboratively, we can address," the source added.



headline: Regulators vote to reduce rates for prison phone calls
byline: By Ian Simpson
8:31am EDT

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted on Friday to reduce prison telephone rates that had made it far more expensive for prison inmates to make phone calls than it is outside prison walls.

The commission voted 2-1 to reduce interstate phone rates for inmates that it said had been as high as $17 for a 15-minute call when extra fees were added in, the panel said in a statement.

The lower fees were aimed at helping prisoners maintain contact with family and friends, which lowers the probability that inmates will return to prison after release, the FCC said.

The new rates will also allow about 2.7 million children who have a parent in prison or jail to remain in touch, the statement said.

"The Commission's reforms adopt a simple and balanced approach that protects security and public safety needs, ensures providers receive fair compensation while providing reasonable rates to consumers," it said.

In an interim move, the FCC limited per-minute rates to 25 cents for long-distance collect calls, meaning that a 15-minute call cannot top $3.75. Debit and prepaid calls were capped at 21 cents a minute, or $3.15 for 15 minutes.

Extra fees and commissions to connect calls also are banned. The new rules go into effect immediately, the agency said.

The FCC's vote ends a practice in 42 of 50 U.S. states where a handful of phone companies were awarded the bulk of prison contracts.

The issue had been pending at the FCC for nearly a decade, when District of Columbia resident Martha Wright, who had a grandson in prison, petitioned for relief from high phone rates.

A May study by the Prison Policy Initiative, an advocacy group, showed that fees made up 38 percent of the $1 billion paid for prisoners' phone calls.

Acting Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, both Democrats, voted in favor of the change. Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai dissented.

Pai said in a statement that the new rules would be difficult to administer and have "unintended consequences," since the rates would be too low for prisons to offer full phone service.

The Cleveland man sentenced to life in prison for the abduction, rape and torture of three women, was moved to a prison in southern Ohio where he will be isolated from other inmates for his own protection and to "maintain order," a prison spokeswoman said on Friday.

Ariel Castro, 53, was transferred on Monday to a processing facility in Orient, Ohio, where he will undergo a series of mental and physical assessments, according to Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman JoEllen Smith.

"Inmate Castro had been segregated from the general population. He has no interaction with other inmates at this time," Smith said.

This means that Castro will be in a cell for 23 hours of the day, with one hour out of the cell for recreation but separated from other inmates, she said.

"It is not uncommon for an inmate with a high profile case to be put in protective custody," said Smith. "There are two reasons for this - to maintain order in the institution and to keep the inmate safe."

Castro held Michelle Knight, now 32, Gina DeJesus, now 23 and Amanda Berry, now 27, captive in his dark, fortress-like house in Cleveland for nine to 11 years.

The women were freed on May 6, when Berry was able to break open a door with the help of neighbors. Also rescued with them was Berry's 6-year-old daughter fathered by Castro during captivity.

The abuse the women endured over about a decade was so extreme that a judge sentenced Castro to life in prison plus 1,000 years, after he pleaded guilty to 937 charges including aggravated murder for starving and beating Knight to cause her to miscarry during pregnancy.

Castro showed no remorse at his sentencing hearing last week, arguing with the judge and blaming his actions on a sex and porn addiction.

The decision to keep Castro segregated was made by prison authorities due to the notoriety of his case, prison officials said.

Castro will be permitted visitors as soon as next week. Court records showed that only his mother and sister visited him when he was imprisoned prior to the sentencing.

The house where the three women were imprisoned was demolished on Wednesday.



headline: Florida cabinet allows exhumation at boys reform school

8:31am EDT

Declaring that "there is no shame in searching for the truth," Florida's cabinet agreed on Tuesday to permit bodies to be exhumed at an infamous former boys reform school, to identify dozens of children buried and forgotten in woodlands decades ago.

The institution, the Dozier School for Boys, a sprawling juvenile lock-up near Marianna in the state's Panhandle, was closed in 2011 after years of allegations it tortured boys in its care.

A small group of former prisoners applauded as Governor Rick Scott and the state cabinet unanimously approved a proposal to let a University of South Florida forensic anthropology team conduct dig at an area called "boot hill."

Dozens of suspected grave sites, long unmarked, now have plastic white tubing in the form of crosses in the area -although no one knows where bodies were buried or how many Dozier boys died there between 1914 and 1973.

Ground-penetrating radar has indicated that about 50 bodies may lie beneath the heavily forested hillside. Most of the dead are thought to be black youths, whose families were never told how or why they died.

Johnny Gaddy, a former Dozier student who attended the cabinet meeting, said families were told "you'd better forget it" when they asked about the disappearances.

"In a state as old as Florida is, we're going to have chapters in our history that we're more proud of than others," Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, a cabinet member, said of the decision. "There is no shame in searching for the truth. The families of the victims, who want closure, who want answers, deserve those things."

There is no prospect of prosecuting anyone for the deaths of the boys, but Attorney General Pam Bondi said "all these kids, they deserve proper burials and that's what we're going to give them."

Researchers and students at the University of South Florida in Tampa found records of 98 deaths of boys between ages 6 and 18, plus two adult staff members at the school between 1914 and 1973.

The research, which included an examination of state death records, revealed missing, conflicting and "sloppy" record-keeping about the people buried at Dozier and how they died.

The most common causes of death were disease, fire, physical trauma and drowning. Seven boys died during escape attempts - including one 16-year-old who suffered gunshot wounds to the chest - and 20 died within the first three months of arrival, the report said.

USF professor Erin Kimmerle said her anthropology team can begin work soon in Jackson County. If bones are recovered, identification efforts will involve DNA matching with living relatives of the boys.

Kimmerle and U.S. Senator Bill Nelson visited the site last spring. Nelson has been pushing for exhumation of the burial grounds for several months.

"This decision puts us a step closer to finishing the investigation," Nelson said in a statement. "Nothing can bring these boys back but I'm hopeful that their families will now get the closure they deserve."

A Jackson County circuit judge last May rejected Bondi's request for the local medical examiner to exhume the bodies. Secretary of State Ken Detzner last month also declined to issue permits for the search.

Tuesday's decision gives USF a one-year permit to conduct the exhumation.

Nelson is backing a $3 million proposal for a U.S. Department of Justice grant for forensic research at the site.

State Representative Alan Williams, chairman of the state Legislative Black Caucus, applauded the governor and cabinet's decision.

"I am hopeful that the results of the research will provide some degree of comfort and closure to the families who have lost loved ones," said Williams. "This decision is a victory for the families who have long fought to exhume remains at the Dozier School for Boys."

trapped his getaway car or a hideout with explosives, police said.

The public warning, which police said was based on newly uncovered evidence, came as authorities escalated a multi-state manhunt for 40-year-old computer technician James Lee DiMaggio, described as a longtime friend of the family.

He is wanted in the killing of Christina Anderson, 44, and in the disappearance of her two children, 16-year-old Hannah and 8-year-old Ethan, all of whom were last seen on Saturday, the day before he is suspected of setting his own house on fire.

Authorities have not revealed how the mother was killed. Her body was found on Sunday night inside DiMaggio's flame-ravaged rural home in the San Diego County community of Boulevard, not far from the California-Mexico border, along with the badly burned remains of an unidentified child.

Authorities have said the child's body may be that of Ethan Anderson, but that it will take more time for medical examiners to make a positive identification.

The children's father, Brett Anderson, who now lives in Tennessee, has said he presumes the body is that of his son, though investigators said they have yet to rule out the possibility that DiMaggio has abducted both Anderson children.

The father, who in a televised message earlier this week pleaded with DiMaggio to let his daughter go and advised the teenager to make a run for it, described Hannah and Ethan in a CNN interview on Thursday as loving, outgoing children who were active in school and sports.

"There's nothing bad to say about my kids. They never did anything to anybody. They were always wonderful. We were pretty tight knit, even though I was a couple thousand miles away," he said.

Asked about DiMaggio, a longtime family friend said to have been like an uncle to the children, Anderson said, "I can't fathom what happened in Jim's head, what happened. He obviously lost it."

MANHUNT EXPANDS

A statewide child-abduction notice, called an Amber Alert, was issued in California on Monday for both children, and authorities said DiMaggio was initially believed to be headed by car for Texas or Canada. He previously lived in Houston.

Subsequent alerts were issued on Wednesday in Oregon and Washington state after a car matching the description of the vehicle DiMaggio was believed to be driving was spotted headed north in northern California near the Oregon border.

The abduction alert was also extended to Nevada, Mexico and British Columbia, according to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department homicide detective overseeing the case, Lieutenant Glenn Giannantonio.

He warned members of the public to consider the suspect dangerous and possibly armed.

"We have reason to believe DiMaggio may have placed incendiary devices or booby traps on his vehicle or in the area where he's staying," the detective said.

He said police and FBI agents taking part in the investigation had no firm clue as to the suspect's whereabouts or intended destination, and that there was no particular geographic focus to the manhunt so far.

Authorities had received numerous reports of possible sightings, though none had been confirmed, he said. No communication had been received from the suspect or from Hannah Anderson.

"We are still believing they could be anywhere in the country," he said, adding that investigators believed DiMaggio, considered an avid outdoorsman, could be holed up in a remote, backcountry area.

Authorities have said they have no evidence of a precipitating incident or circumstances that might have led to the crimes DiMaggio is suspected of committing.



headline: Bangladeshi man sentenced to 30 years for New York Fed bomb plot
byline: By Jonathan Allen
8:31am EDT

A judge sentenced a Bangladeshi man to 30 years in prison on Friday after he admitted that he intended to use a bomb in what U.S. authorities called a plot to blow up the New York Federal Reserve Bank.

Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, 22, who had pleaded guilty to the government's charge of "attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction" and faced life in prison, told the judge he now rejects radical Islam and apologized to the people of New York and the United States. Prosecutors had said Nafis had claimed on social media sites to have contacts with al Qaeda.

"I'm ashamed, I'm lost, I tried to do a terrible thing," said Nafis, who was arrested in October 2012 while trying to detonate what he believed to be a 1,000-pound (454-kg) bomb hidden in a van.

Instead, the van carried inert materials planted by an undercover FBI agent as part of a sting operation. Prosecutors said Nafis attempted to use a mobile phone to detonate the bogus device.

Before handing down the sentence, Judge Carol Amon in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn said it was clear Nafis intended to go through with the plot in lower Manhattan.

"He continually dialed the cell phone number that he thought would explode the device," the judge said. Still, she said she was "prepared to accept that the remorse he had expressed is genuine."

Had Nafis been able to accomplish what he had set out to do, prosecutor James Loonam said, it would have been "a Boston Marathon style terrorist attack." In April, home-made bombs killed three people and injured 264 others near the marathon finish line.

Loonam asked the judge to punish Nafis within the federal sentencing guidelines of 30 years to life in prison.

The defense asked for a more lenient sentence of 20 years for Nafis, who wore khaki prison overalls and handcuffs.

He had a strict, isolated upbringing and his upper middle class parents sometimes beat him for failing to focus enough on his studies, once so severely he temporarily went mute when he was 6 years old, said his court-appointed defense lawyer Heidi Cesare. As a university student in Dhaka, Bangladesh, he got his first taste of freedom and became radicalized by other students, she said.

According to a criminal complaint unsealed in October, Nafis entered the United States in 2012 with a student visa, and eventually traveled to the New York City borough of Queens.

It said he scouted targets for a potential attack, including the New York Stock Exchange and U.S. President Barack Obama, settling eventually on the Federal Reserve Bank in Manhattan.

Nafis attempted to recruit others to his plot, and discussed his plans over social media sites such as Facebook, the complaint said. He claimed he was in contact with al Qaeda operatives overseas and actively sought out new al Qaeda connections in the United States, the complaint said.

One of the individuals he brought on board was an undercover agent working for the FBI, who monitored Nafis' activities and helped arm him with the inoperable explosives, federal authorities said.

duration spaceflight.

Astronaut Mark Kelly, who commanded four space shuttle missions including the final flight of Endeavour, is set to be a test subject on Earth while his twin undergoes studies in orbit.

Kelly left NASA in 2011 to care for his wife, former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords. She was shot through the head in January 2011 when a gunman opened fire at a political event in Arizona, killing six people and wounding 26 others.

His brother, Scott Kelly, is preparing for a year-long mission aboard the International Space Station, the longest single spaceflight NASA has ever attempted.

Four Russian cosmonauts lived for a year or longer aboard the now-defunct Mir space station.

"This is sort of our first foray into the genetic aspects of spaceflight," said John Charles, chief scientist with NASA's human research program at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

"A study like this is going to be mostly observational, just see what we can find out," he said.

The U.S. space agency is soliciting ideas from researchers about possible experiments.

Mark Kelly, who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with his wife, has volunteered to go to Houston several times during his brother's year-long spaceflight for tests, Charles said.

Scott Kelly is a veteran of two shuttle missions and previously served as a space station crew member and commander.

Scientists would be looking for genetic differences in the twins due to one brother living in the gravity-free environment of space and the other on Earth.

"I'm hopeful that most of this can be done with blood that will be drawn or with things like questionnaires and surveys. That would be the easiest to implement," Charles said.

"But we are prepared for any kind of suggestions that the scientific community present that do pass peer-review and do promise to illuminate the differences in (identical) twins in response to spaceflight," he said.

Scott Kelly, who will be paired with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko for the year-long spaceflight, is set to board the station in March 2015, about a month after he and his brother turn 50.

Proposals for the twins studies are due next month.



headline: 16 maintenance workers in NJ said to be Powerball winners
byline: By Victoria Cavaliere
8:31am EDT

A group of 16 maintenance workers from a county government garage in New Jersey share one of three winning tickets in the $448 million Powerball lottery jackpot, their boss said on Friday.

"Yes, we have 16 county workers from the Vehicle Maintenance Department who have won the lottery," Ocean County Vehicle Maintenance Department Director Jim Pine told Reuters.

New Jersey Lottery spokeswoman Judith Drucker said on Friday the owners of the two winning tickets sold in New Jersey, including the Ocean County group, have not come forward. The third winner was in Minnesota, where he held a press conference on Thursday.

Pine said the winners would go public next week, although they have not yet decided when they will validate their ticket.

"They are the most outstanding, dedicated group of people, and you'll be so pleased to meet them next week," Pine said. He added that all 16 have come to work since winning the Powerball drawing on Wednesday evening.

Winning tickets were sold at an Acme Markets store in the Jersey shore town of Little Egg Harbor and at a Super Stop &amp; Shop supermarket in South Brunswick, said Judith Drucker, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Lottery.

The only confirmed winner is Minnesota engineer Paul White, 45, who was introduced on Thursday. He said he was so excited about winning he ran around the office of the Minneapolis contracting firm where he works.

White, a divorced father of a 16-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter, savored his win at a news conference at lottery headquarters by recalling when he first realized he hit it big.

"It's crazy, I've got to tell you," White said of the moment on Thursday morning at Elliott Contracting in Minneapolis, where he works as a project engineer.

He jumped up and ran around the office, and asked several people to look at the ticket to verify the Powerball number of 32 and numbers 5-25-30-58-59.

He then went to the Minnesota Lottery office, where he chose to take a cash payment of $86 million, or $58.3 million after taxes, from his $149 million share of the total jackpot.

"I have been waiting for this moment all my life," White said, after being asked why he came forward so quickly.

White said he had imagined winning the lottery "so many times in my head." He was joined by Kim VanReese, 45, his partner of about 4-1/2 years; Ron Bowen, his boss; and Bowen's wife, Nancy Bowen, who works at the firm.

"He started the day my boss. He's going to end the day my chauffeur," White joked.

White, who said he had been looking at a used Acura NSX sports car before the jackpot, said he would not leave his employer in a lurch but added: "I don't want to work for anybody else for the rest of my life, I mean for a paycheck."

The odds of winning the jackpot were about one in 175 million.

Asked if he was disappointed that he was splitting the jackpot three ways, White joked, "I think I can get by on it. We will see."

The largest jackpot in history stands at $656 million, won in the Mega Millions lottery in March 2012. That prize was split among winners in Maryland, Kansas and Illinois.

The biggest single-winner Powerball jackpot, of $590.5 million, was claimed in June by an 84-year-old Florida woman who opted for a lump-sum payment of nearly $371 million rather than the 30-year option.

Powerball tickets are sold in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Five states - Kansas, Maryland, Delaware, North Dakota and Ohio - allow the winners to remain anonymous, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.



headline: NSA to cut system administrators by 90 percent to limit data access
byline: By Jonathan Allen
8:31am EDT

The National Security Agency, hit by disclosures of classified data by former contractor Edward Snowden, said Thursday it intends to eliminate about 90 percent of its system administrators to reduce the number of people with access to secret information.

Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, the U.S. spy agency charged with monitoring foreign electronic communications, told a cybersecurity conference in New York City that automating much of the work would improve security.

"What we're in the process of doing - not fast enough - is reducing our system administrators by about 90 percent," he said.

The remarks came as the agency is facing scrutiny after Snowden, who had been one of about 1,000 system administrators who help run the agency's networks, leaked classified details about surveillance programs to the press.

Before the change, "what we've done is we've put people in the loop of transferring data, securing networks and doing things that machines are probably better at doing," Alexander said.

Using technology to automate much of the work now done by employees and contractors would make the NSA's networks "more defensible and more secure," as well as faster, he said at the conference, in which he did not mention Snowden by name.

These efforts pre-date Snowden's leaks, the agency has said, but have since been accelerated.

Alexander's remarks largely echoed similar comments made to Congress and at other public appearances over the past two months since his agency came under fire from civil liberties advocates and lawmakers concerned by Snowden's revelations.

Snowden leaked documents to the Guardian and the Washington Post, which published stories revealing previously secret telephone and internet surveillance programs run by the U.S. government.

Snowden now faces criminal charges but has since been granted temporary asylum in Russia.

Other security measures that Alexander has previously discussed include requiring at least two people to be present before certain data can be accessed on the agency's computer systems.

"At the end of the day it's about people and trust," Alexander said. He again defended his agency's conduct, much of which he said had been "grossly mischaracterized" by the press.

"No one has willfully or knowingly disobeyed the law or tried to invade your civil liberties or privacies," he said. "There were no mistakes like that at all."

He told his audience to "get the facts" and make up their own minds, adding that the agency itself could do more to enable this: "We've got to push out more, I recognize that," he said.



headline: L.A. police close inquiry into Scientology leader's wife
byline: By Eric Kelsey
8:31am EDT

The Los Angeles Police Department on Thursday closed their inquiry into the whereabouts of the wife of Scientology leader David Miscavige, a police spokesman said.

The location of Miscavige's wife, Shelly, had come under police investigation after actress Leah Remini, who recently left the Church of Scientology, filed a missing person report, a source close to the actress told Reuters.

The LAPD would not say who filed the report or when it was filed.

"The investigation has been closed and we consider the report to be unfounded," Los Angeles Police Detective Gus Villanueva said. He declined to elaborate on the details in the report and why it was closed.

Shelly Miscavige's whereabouts have been a focus of church critics, who claim she has not appeared in public in six years.

By filing the report with police, Remini could have posed a challenge to the church, which relies heavily on its celebrity members for visibility. Tom Cruise and John Travolta are among the most well-known members and only a handful of celebrities have left.

Remini, 43, who is best known for her role in the CBS comedy "The King of Queens," recently left the church after coming under special scrutiny after she asked about the whereabouts of Shelly Miscavige, the New York Post newspaper reported.

Remini had asked why Shelly Miscavige was not at the 2006 wedding of Cruise to actress Katie Holmes, the newspaper said. Remini's representatives have not confirmed that event.

The Church of Scientology, which has said in the past that Shelly Miscavige is not missing and has been working "non-stop" in the church, pushed back against such reports.

"This is just harassment," the church said in a statement. "It is a publicity stunt cooked up by a small band of unemployed fanatics who live on the fringe of the Internet."

The religion, which was founded in 1954 by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, believes man is an immortal being whose experience extends beyond one lifetime.

A fireworks vendor from Washington state is accused of strapping a homemade bomb to a dog's neck and detonating it and will face animal cruelty and explosives charges, prosecutors said on Thursday.

Christopher Dillingham, 45, was arrested early Sunday morning at his home in the small town of Stevenson on suspicion of having killed his daughter's yellow Labrador Retriever with an explosive device.

According to charging documents, Dillingham told Skamania County sheriff's deputies that he believed the dog "had the devil in it."

Prosecutors on Monday charged Dillingham with one felony count of possession of a bomb with intent to use it for an unlawful purpose and two gross misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment. The charges carry a maximum of 20 years in prison.

Skamania County Prosecuting Attorney Adam Kick said Dillingham would also be charged with animal cruelty, and would be arraigned next week. Dillingham is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail.

When authorities arrived at his home after responding to emergency calls from members of his family, they found Dillingham muttering to himself and emptying his house of metal, the charging papers said.

Dillingham told authorities he made the bomb out of explosive powder from fireworks and placed it around the dog's neck. He said he distracted the dog by feeding it treats and detonated the bomb from behind a wall, the charging papers said.

Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is being treated in a Mississippi hospital for a ruptured appendix, a former aide said on Thursday.

Mississippi radio station WLOX said Lott, 71, was in fair condition. Supervisor Chris Nail at Baptist Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi, confirmed that Lott was a patient but declined to disclose any details, citing patient privacy rights.

Lott's former aide, Lee Youngblood, said he spoke to the former Senator's family members, who told him Lott's appendix had burst.

"I don't know how long he's going to be in the hospital, but he's expected to recover," Youngblood said.

Lott, a Republican and native of Pascagoula, Mississippi, spent 34 years in Congress before retiring in 2007. He works for a Washington-based lobbying firm, Breaux Lott Leadership Group.

Youngblood said he did not know precisely when Lott was admitted to the hospital.

A former Texas special education teacher, described by a colleague as a "gentle giant," fatally shot four people including his estranged wife and current girlfriend, in a spasm of apparent domestic violence, police said on Thursday.

Four other people were wounded, three of them critically, in the attacks late Wednesday night in a home in Dallas and another house in DeSoto, a suburb about 15 miles south of Dallas, said Corporal Melissa Franks of the DeSoto Police Department.

Erbie Bowser, 44, was charged late on Thursday with murder in the deaths of his estranged wife Zina Bowser, 47, and her daughter Neima Williams, 28, Franks said.

Also dead were Bowser's girlfriend, Toya Smith, 43, and her daughter Tasmia Allen, 17, said Dallas Police Major Jeff Cotner. Charges against Bowser in connection with those shootings were being prepared, he said.

The four wounded included three boys, ages 11, 13, and 14, all in critical condition, and a 17-year-old girl whose condition was not given, police said.

None of the four wounded were related to Bowser, police said.

Bowser was a well-liked special education teacher, in Mesquite, Texas, who resigned in 2010, said Laura Jobe, a spokeswoman for the Mesquite Independent School District.

"He had a good history here," she said. "He's been described as a gentle giant." He also coached football in Mesquite, she said.

Bowser had also been a member of a dance team for the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team but left the squad in 2009, the team said.

Police said the first emergency call came late on Wednesday evening from a woman who became concerned after speaking by phone with someone at the Dallas home. She drove to the house but no one answered.

Another emergency call was received from the DeSoto residence.

"We do believe this is a domestic-related incident," a police official said.

All of those killed were believed to have died from gunshot wounds, although Franks said an explosive device was used as well.

It was too early to say what type of device was used and samples were sent for laboratory testing, said Russ Morrison with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Bowser had military training, serving in the U.S. Army from 1991 to 2000, a U.S. Army spokesman said. He reached the rank of sergeant and received several medals, including one for good conduct, and an "Expert Infantryman" badge, he said.

described "toughest sheriff" was shot and killed in the driveway of his Phoenix home as he prepared to go to work before dawn on Thursday, authorities said.

Police officers using dogs mounted a two-hour search of the residential neighborhood after the shooting of the officer, who authorities said had been wearing clothing with a sheriff's office insignia on it. There was no immediate word on motive.

"We will certainly look into whether it was related to his duties, but at this point we don't know," Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Trent Crump said. No arrests have been made.

Witnesses reported they heard several shots fired at about 4 a.m. and spotted a man fleeing the scene on foot, police said. Television footage from the scene showed a pick-up truck in the driveway with its hood up and the driver's door open.

When authorities arrived at the scene, they found the officer severely wounded in front of the home. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.

The officer was identified as Jorge Vargas, 27, an eight-year veteran with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. He worked in the system's food factory, which is responsible for the management and distribution of food throughout the jails.

Sheriff Joe Arpaio told a news conference that he does not know the motive for the killing, or whether the officer was targeted.

"Right now the main mission is to find this guy and get him in jail," Arpaio told reporters.

Arpaio, 81, has been a lightning rod for controversy over his aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. The six-term sheriff has been the subject of several investigations and lawsuits stemming from his get-tough policies.



headline: U.S. and Russia seek to keep working ties despite Snowden, summit fuss
byline: By Lesley Wroughton and Phil Stewart
8:31am EDT

U.S. and Russian officials will seek to maintain a working relationship when they meet in Washington on Friday, even though the political mood between their countries has hit one of its lowest points since the end of the Cold War.

President Barack Obama's cancellation this week of a summit in Moscow with President Vladimir Putin finally put to rest any notion that a much-vaunted "reset" of ties sought by the United States in recent years is alive.

Obama's move came after Putin gave asylum to former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden, whose public flight after revealing U.S. surveillance programs was a major embarrassment for Washington.

Influential Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham have sought a tougher response and have called on NATO to give membership to Georgia - with which Russia fought a brief war in 2008 - as part of an aggressive new policy against Moscow that would include weaning Europe off Russian energy supplies.

Senior U.S. officials though have stressed the need to keep up cooperation with Moscow.

"Let's be clear. It is still an important relationship," White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Thursday. "We have a lot of fish to fry, if you will, with the Russians. We have a lot of issues to engage with the Russians over."

U.S. officials expect no breakthroughs when Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel meet their Russian counterparts Sergei Lavrov and Sergei Shoigu on Friday, but they say the very decision to go ahead with the talks despite the current frictions is significant in itself.

Moscow and Washington disagree over a long list of issues, from Syria's civil war to human rights and Russia's ban on homosexual "propaganda," but there are some areas, critical to global security, where they have been able to work together.

WORKING TOGETHER

Russia has been a U.S. partner in talks with Iran over Tehran's nuclear ambitions and this role is likely to take on more importance after signals from new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani that he might be more willing to reach a deal with the West than his predecessor.

Last year Moscow joined the United States in condemning former Soviet ally North Korea's launch of a ballistic missile and the United States and NATO rely on a complex web of transit routes through Russia and Central Asia to supply their war effort in landlocked Afghanistan.

U.S. officials cite this Northern Distribution Network for Afghanistan as "an example of where there's a good partnership" and Washington will want to avoid any fight with Russia that could lead to this being closed down.

"We believe we need to continue to cooperate on areas where we can, where there's progress to be made in the world, and Iran and North Korea are both certainly good examples of that," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told a news briefing.

While Lavrov and Kerry have met multiple times to discuss ending the Syrian war, it will be the first time Hagel and Shoigu will meet face to face in the so-called 2 + 2 talks.

"We and they want to keep talking and keep exchanging views with the hope that over time we can break through on some core issues," one U.S. official said.

Psaki said areas where there were disagreements like missile defense and human rights, and "certainly Edward Snowden" would be part of the discussions.

But a U.S. official said the American side would try again to ease Russian concerns about its missile defense plans.

Russia remains wary of U.S. missile defenses, despite Hagel's announcement in March that Washington would forgo a new type of interceptor in Europe.

Dimitri Simes, a Russia expert and president of the Center for the National Interest think tank in Washington, said open discussions between Moscow and Washington were still the best way to resolve differences on issues like international terrorism, Afghanistan, and Syria.

"Russia is not a convenient partner in dealing with any of these matters, but they are an important partner," Simes said. "I think the administration realizes that much. I think that is the reason they did not cancel the two plus two."

Russia has remained a staunch backer of President Bashar al-Assad throughout the worsening conflict in Syria, much to Washington's annoyance.

It is not clear whether Putin will soften that stance after U.S. ally Saudi Arabia offered economic incentives to Russia last week including a major arms deal if it scales back support for Assad.

abduction alert was issued in Nevada on Thursday in the search for two Southern California siblings missing since their mother was found slain in the burned out home of a family friend suspected of killing her.

The notice in Nevada, following similar alerts issued earlier this week in California, Oregon and Washington state, came as authorities escalated their manhunt for the suspect, 40-year-old James Lee DiMaggio.

He is wanted in the killing of Christina Anderson, 44, and in the disappearance of her two children, 16-year-old Hannah and 8-year-old Ethan, all of whom were last seen on Saturday. Authorities have not revealed how the mother was killed.

Her body was found on Sunday night inside DiMaggio's burned-out backcountry home in the eastern San Diego County community of Boulevard, not far from the California-Mexican border, along with the badly burned remains of an unidentified child.

Authorities have said the child's body may be that of Ethan Anderson but it will take more time for medical examiners to make a positive identification.

In the meantime, the children's father, Brett Anderson, who now lives in Tennessee, has said he presumes the body is that of his son, though investigators said they have yet to rule out the possibility that DiMaggio has abducted both Anderson children.

The father, who made a televised plea to DiMaggio earlier this week to let his daughter go, described Hannah and Ethan in a CNN interview on Thursday as loving, outgoing children who were active in school and sports.

"There's nothing bad to say about my kids. They never did anything to anybody. They were always wonderful. We were pretty tight knit, even though I was a couple thousand miles away," he said.

Asked about DiMaggio, an information technology worker and longtime family friend who was said to have been like an uncle to the children, Anderson said, "I can't fathom what happened in Jim's head, what happened. He obviously lost it."

An alert was issued in California on Monday for both children, and authorities said DiMaggio was initially believed to be headed by car for Texas or Canada.

Subsequent alerts were issued on Wednesday in Oregon and Washington state after a car matching the description of the vehicle DiMaggio was believed to be driving was spotted headed northbound in northern California near the Oregon border.

It was not immediately clear what prompted the latest alert in Nevada.

On Wednesday, sheriff's Lieutenant Glenn Giannantonio, a homicide detective, said investigators had no clue as to the suspect's intended destination. He said FBI agents have joined in the search and that Mexican law enforcement authorities and the U.S. Border Patrol were on the lookout for DiMaggio.

Authorities said it was possible that DiMaggio could be camping out in a rural area near his home.

"As we've said all along - he could be in Mexico, he could be in Canada or he could be a mile away," sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said.

Authorities have said they have no evidence of a precipitating incident or circumstances that might have led to the crimes DiMaggio is suspected of committing.



headline: Soldiers recall bloody mayhem of 2009 Fort Hood massacre
byline: By Karen Brooks and Lisa Maria Garza
8:31am EDT

One after another, U.S. Army soldiers described panic and chaos, smelling smoke and blood and feces, feeling the sharp pain of bullets tearing through their backs, legs, shoulders and arms.

A pregnant woman cried out "my baby! my baby!" before being shot dead.

They were not in the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan, but on the Fort Hood military base in Texas on November 5, 2009, when one of their own, Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan, opened fire on anyone in uniform, witnesses testified at Hasan's court-martial on Thursday.

They recalled playing dead in order to escape more harm and making futile efforts to save their friends. The soldiers were unable to fire back because they are prohibited from carrying weapons on base. Military police eventually shot Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down and attends court in a wheelchair.

"There were a lot of bodies on the ground. The chairs were overturned, a lot of blood on the floor. It smelled like gunpowder, feces, blood. Pretty bad," said Staff Sergeant Michael Davis, who thought the gunfire was a drill until "I saw somebody get hit, I saw a blood spray."

Hasan, a U.S.-born Muslim, admitted to the jury on the opening day of testimony on Tuesday that "I am the shooter," saying he had "switched sides" in what he called a U.S. war on Islam.

In the shooting rampage days before Hasan was to be deployed to Afghanistan, he killed 13 and wounded 31 at the Soldier Readiness Processing Center on the base.

DEATH PENALTY

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges but Hasan could still face the death penalty if all 13 officers on the jury find him guilty of premeditated murder, possibly making him the first service member executed by the U.S. military since 1961.

Earlier on Thursday, Judge Colonel Tara Osborn denied a request by Hasan's standby lawyers to reduce their role, ordering them to continue assisting Hasan in defending himself.

The three lawyers said Hasan was actively seeking the death penalty - an assertion disputed by Hasan - and they objected to playing a role in such an outcome.

Osborn turned the defense lawyers down, saying the U.S. Constitution allowed Hasan the right to defend himself and calling the rift "nothing more than their disagreement with Major Hasan's trial strategy."

Among the 12 eyewitnesses to testify was Private Lance Aviles, who recalled seeing his friend, Private First Class Kham Xiong, being shot dead just moments after chatting about the New York Yankees' recent victory in the World Series.

"I see my buddy hit the floor. He had an exit wound from the back of his skull, and blood on my boots," Aviles said.

Sergeant Maria Guerra recalled a woman crying "Please don't! Please don't! My baby! My baby!" as the shooting began.

Private Francheska Velez, six weeks pregnant, was shot in the back as she pleaded for her unborn child's life, prosecutors said in opening statements.

"He was firing into the crowd of soldiers," Guerra said, choking back tears. "As he's firing, he's very efficiently dropping his magazine and coming up with another magazine."

headline: U.S. declares 'unusual mortality event' as dolphin deaths rise
byline: By Francesca Trianni
8:31am EDT

Federal scientists investigating an unusually high number of dead bottlenose dolphins washing up on the East Coast said on Thursday the carcasses are showing up at a rate that is seven times higher than usual.

More than 120 dead animals have been discovered since June from New Jersey to Virginia, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Fisheries Service said.

Federal scientists have declared it an "unusual mortality event" and are investigating the cause, said Maggie Mooney-Seus of NOAA Fisheries.

A number of things can cause dolphins to strand, including harmful algal blooms, infectious viruses, injuries due to ship strikes, pollutants and human-made runoff, NOAA said.

Although the cause has not been determined, early tissue analysis showed that one suspect could be morbillivirus, an infectious pathogen, said Teri Rowles, national marine mammal stranding coordinator for NOAA Fisheries.

Marine stranding response centers are collecting information on the deaths and necropsies are being performed, but it could take several weeks to determine what led to the deaths, the NOAA said.

In this month alone, 28 dolphins were found dead along the shores of the East Coast.

It has been 25 years since the last large die-off of dolphins along the U.S. coast. In 1987, more than 740 animals died of morbillivirus on the coast from New Jersey to Florida.

Scientists warned the public not to approach the animals if they see one stranded because they could harbor an infectious disease.

They ask that dead or stranded mammals in the Northeast be reported to NOAA's marine mammal stranding network at 1-866-755-6622.

made World War Two era submachine gun that prosecutors said was one of many used by Bulger's Winter Hill crime gang.

Jurors went home without reaching a verdict, but the request to see the gun could indicate they are making progress deciding on the raft of murder, extortion and other charges against Bulger. The last of the 32 criminal counts he faces alleges the former crime boss was in possession of guns with obliterated serial numbers.

Jurors will begin their fourth day of deliberations on Friday.

The 9mm MP40 had been among several weapons with filed serial numbers paraded through the courtroom since Bulger's trial began on June 12. Prosecutors said the weapons were seized from Bulger's notorious gang.

Bulger, 83, could spend the rest of his life behind bars if convicted of even some of the charges related to 19 murders prosecutors said he ordered or committed in the 1970s and '80s.

Nicknamed "Whitey" because of the shock of blonde hair he had as a young man, Bulger, has pleaded not guilty to all charges, although his lawyers acknowledged he was a drug dealer, extortionist, loan shark and "organized criminal.

One of the criminal counts he faces, racketeering offense, contains 38 individual criminal acts including 19 murders he is said to have carried out or ordered in 1970s and 80s.

On Wednesday, after a series of questions, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper said the 12-member jury only needs to find that Bulger committed two of the 38 acts over a decade to be guilty of the racketeering count.

'DUTY' TO DECIDE

She amended that guidance on Thursday after prosecution lawyers suggested that the families of Bulger's victims were worried the jury would fail to reach a decision on some of the murders.

"I remind you that ... you have a duty to attempt to reach agreement on each of the counts and on each of the racketeering acts, if you can do so conscientiously," Casper told the jurors before releasing them into their third day of deliberations.

The survivors of several of the people Bulger is accused of killing were a regular presence in the courtroom through the trial which lasted nearly eight weeks.

Bulger's lawyers had argued that he was not responsible for the deaths of two women among his alleged victims. They said Bulger's partner, Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi murdered the women, Flemmi's girlfriend and stepdaughter.

The trial included testimony from former hit men, FBI agents, drug dealers and other witnesses who described brazen killings, massive drug and weapons heists and harrowing extortion encounters.

The case was decades in the making. During the years that Bulger ruled Boston's underworld, corrupt FBI agents turned a blind eye to his crimes in exchange for information about the Italian Mafia, then a top FBI target, according to prosecutors.

Bulger's attorneys deny their client was ever an informant, or "rat" in gangster lingo, contending he paid agents for tips but never offer any of his own.

The gang boss fled Boston after a 1994 tip from a corrupt agent that arrest was imminent. He spent 16 years on the lam, many of them on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted" list.

Agents caught up with him in June 2011, living in a seaside Santa Monica, California, apartment with a stash of guns, more than $800,000 in cash and his girlfriend Catherine Greig -- a former dental technician who in the gang's heyday had supplied pliers they used to pull victims' teeth from their mouths.



headline: Minnesota engineer revealed as Powerball lottery winner
byline: By David Bailey
8:31am EDT

A Minnesota engineer was introduced on Thursday as one of three winners of a $448 million Powerball lottery, and said he was so excited to discover he had a lucky ticket that he ran around the office at a Minneapolis contracting firm where he works.

"It's crazy, I've got to tell you," said Paul White, 45, a divorced father of a 16-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter.

White said he learned on Thursday morning at Elliott Contracting in Minneapolis, where he works as a project engineer, that he had a winning ticket. He jumped up and ran around the office, and asked several people to look at the ticket to verify the Powerball number of 32 and numbers 5-25-30-58-59.

He then went to the Minnesota Lottery office where he chose to take a cash payment of $86 million, or $58.3 million after taxes, from his $149 million share of the total jackpot.

"I have been waiting for this moment all my life," White said in response to a question why he had come forward so quickly.

White said he had imagined winning the lottery "so many times in my head". He was joined on Thursday by Kim VanReese, 45, his partner of about 4-1/2 years, Ron Bowen, his boss at Elliott, and Bowen's wife, Nancy Bowen, who works at Elliott.

"He started the day my boss. He's going to end the day my chauffeur," White said, joking.

White, who said he had been looking at a used Acura NSX sports car before the jackpot, said he would not leave his employer in a lurch but added: "I don't want to work for anybody else for the rest of my life, I mean that for a paycheck."

The odds of winning the jackpot were about one in 175 million.

Asked if he was disappointed that he was splitting the jackpot three ways, White joked, "I think I can get by on it. We will see."

IDENTITIES OF OTHER WINNERS A MYSTERY

The identity of the other two winning ticket holders, purchased separately in New Jersey, remained a mystery. Those tickets were sold at a Super Stop &amp; Shop supermarket in South Brunswick and at an Acme Markets store in Little Egg Harbor, said Judith Drucker, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Lottery.

"It's nice. It's good for whoever won," said Howard Witzgall, store manager of the Stop &amp; Shop, which pledged to donate to the South Brunswick community an undetermined portion of its $30,000 bonus for selling a winning ticket.

Acme Markets, a grocery chain operated by Supervalu, said it would donate $10,000 of its $30,000 bonus to hunger relief programs and other charities in Ocean County, a section of the Jersey Shore that was hard-hit by Hurricane Sandy, said Acme spokeswoman Angela Perez.

"We didn't win, but we just really hope it goes to someone who needs it. This town was pretty hurt by the storm last year," said Dara Conklin, 53, a school teacher who is among 43,000 residents of Egg Harbor Township.

The Minnesota lottery pays a bonus of $50,000 to stores in its state that sell a winning ticket. White bought the ticket at a Holiday Station store in Ham Lake.

The largest jackpot in history stands at $656 million, won in the Mega Millions lottery in March 2012. That prize was split among winners in Maryland, Kansas and Illinois.

The biggest single-winner Powerball jackpot, of $590.5 million, was claimed in June by an 84-year-old Florida woman who opted for a lump-sum payment of nearly $371 million rather than the 30-year option.

Powerball tickets are sold in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Five states - Kansas, Maryland, Delaware, North Dakota and Ohio - allow the winners to remain anonymous, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.



headline: Miami teenage graffiti artist dies after being tasered by police
byline: By Zachary Fagenson
8:31am EDT

old graffiti artist who died after being struck by a Taser during a chase with police in Miami Beach, on Thursday called for an independent investigation into what he called "an act of barbarism."

Police say they witnessed Israel Hernandez-Llach spray-painting a shuttered former McDonald's restaurant early on Tuesday and stunned him with the electroshock weapon after he refused to stop.

Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez said his department was investigating the incident and expressed his condolences to the family of Hernandez-Llach, a Colombian immigrant who graduated from high school this summer.

The family held a press conference with lawyers at their Miami Beach apartment on Thursday to say they planned to file a complaint with the FBI or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement over what they described as excessive use of force by the officers involved.

"We do not want Miami Beach police investigating the Miami Beach Police Department. We're calling for an independent investigation by an outside agency," said Jose Javier Rodriguez, an attorney for the family and a Florida state legislator.

"There is no justification of this kind of action for a second-degree misdemeanor," said Jason W. Kreiss, another lawyer representing the family.

Hernandez-Llach would likely not have been prosecuted over the spray-painting and would have faced a punishment of community service, he added.

Martinez said Hernandez-Llach fled after being seen "vandalizing private property" shortly before dawn on Tuesday.

He was chased by police and ignored commands to stop running, at which point an officer used his Taser, the police chief said in a statement.

Once in custody, Hernandez-Llach displayed signs of medical distress and was pronounced dead soon after, he said.

"At this time, the cause of death has not been determined by the medical examiner's office. Autopsy and toxicology results are still pending as well," Martinez added.

The artist's father, Israel Hernandez-Bandera, called his son's death "an act of barbarism" and an "assassination of a young artist and photographer."

Friends of Hernandez-Llach who witnessed the police chase accused officers of making jokes after using the Taser.

"I saw four or five cops converge on him and hit him up against the wall," said Felix Fernandez, 18.

He said he was standing nearby acting as a lookout for Hernandez-Llach and tried to warn him when he heard police sirens approaching.

"They were making jokes about how he stiffened up when he was tased. They were congratulating each other on how they caught him," he said, standing by a wall where friends had placed flowers and farewell notes by a solitary letter, "R," sprayed on the wall.

Hernandez-Llach, who identified himself by the so-called tag name "Reefa," was known for his graffiti work as well as for his sculptures and paintings.

"He did it a lot," said Hernandez-Llach's friend, Rafael Lynch, referring to his graffiti. "He wasn't a bad person at all. The cops didn't like him or what he looked like."

The two often met at a Miami Beach skateboard shop where Lynch works.

"To me, right now, he's still here. I hung out with him so much I couldn't imagine him dead," Lynch said.

A former Texas special education teacher, described by a colleague as a "gentle giant," was suspected of fatally shooting four people and wounding four others in an apparent domestic incident late on Wednesday, police said.

The shooting spree began in a home in Dallas and ended soon afterward in another house in DeSoto, a suburb about 15 miles south, said Corporal Melissa Franks of the DeSoto, Texas Police Department.

The suspected gunman, Erbie Bowser, was taken into custody, Franks said.

The two people killed in Dallas were Tasmia Allen, 17, and her mother, Toya Smith, 43. Smith was identified by her mother, Lurlean Smith, as Bowser's girlfriend. "He's controlling," Smith told local television. "He controlled my daughter."

Police did not identify the DeSoto victims, but Verniece Criddell, 79, a relative, said they were Zina Bowser, a nurse and the estranged wife of Erbie Bowser, and her daughter Neima Williams. The two boys, ages 11 and 13, who were wounded in DeSoto were Zina Bowser's sons.

A 17-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were wounded in Dallas.

Family members said that none of the wounded children were related to Bowser.

Bowser was a well-liked special education teacher in Mesquite, Texas who resigned in 2010, said Laura Jobe, a spokeswoman for the Mesquite Independent School District.

"He had a good history here," she said. "He's been described as a gentle giant."

Police said the first emergency call came late on Wednesday evening from a woman who became concerned after speaking by phone with someone at the Dallas home. She drove to the house but no one answered.

Another emergency call was received from the DeSoto residence.

"We do believe this is a domestic-related incident," a police official said.

All of those killed were believed to have died from gunshot wounds, although Franks said an explosive device was used as well.

A U.S. Army spokesman said a man named Erbie Bowser served from 1991 to 2000, reaching the rank of sergeant and receiving several medals, including one for good conduct, and an "Expert Infantryman" badge.

A spokesman for the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team confirmed that Bowser had been a member of the group's dance team, the Mavs ManiAACs and left the squad in 2009.



headline: In shadow of Detroit, a Michigan county delays bond sale
byline: By Joseph Lichterman
8:31am EDT

Michigan's Saginaw County on Thursday postponed a $60.55 million pension obligation bond sale, the latest sign of how Detroit's bankruptcy filing is affecting access to the municipal bond market by other localities in the state.

"The deal has been postponed and no further information about the postponement is available at this time," said Larry Magnesen, director of corporate communications for Fifth Third Bancorp, the lead manager for the deal.

Officials of Saginaw County, which has a population of about 200,000 and is about 100 miles north of Detroit, were not immediately available to comment.

Saginaw County was the third locality in Michigan to postpone a bond sale since Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection on July 18.

"This trend is something we are watching," said Robert Amodeo, portfolio manager at Western Asset. "It is worrisome. We have to wait and see if this will also happen to larger issuers when they come to the market"

"For small issuers, the trend is likely to continue because people do not have the interest or the ability to conduct a credit analysis," Amodeo said.

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's office said 651 local communities in the state have bond ratings, and only two of them are not investment grade.

Sara Wurful, spokeswoman for the governor, said that Snyder's office acknowledges "there are concerns out there, though this kind of bond timing generally happens on a regular basis anyway and ultimately it should all work out."

Wurfel said Detroit's situation is unique, and she pointed out that the municipal bond market is also pressured by concerns that the Federal Reserve will soon end its monetary stimulus program, which would likely hurt bond prices.

An S&P; Dow Jones Indices research note issued on Thursday said that Detroit's bankruptcy filing has cost the municipal bond market $13.8 billion in the last three weeks.

The Saginaw deal is rated Aa3 by Moody's Investors service. According to preliminary indication of interest, the taxable bonds were pricing at around 170 basis points over 10-year U.S. Treasury notes.

In a comparable sale in mid-May, Michigan's South Lyon Community School District sold $55.57 million of taxable unlimited general obligation bonds at 110 basis points over 10-year Treasuries.

The credit spread for Michigan's 10-year general obligation bonds stands at 41 basis points over the market's benchmark yield scale for triple-A-rated debt, indicating that investors are demanding a higher yield to own the debt. Since the beginning of the year it had been at 35 basis points over Municipal Market Data's scale for 30 weeks.

There have been no new bonds sales from Michigan issuers on the U.S. municipal bond market for an amount greater than $7 million since Detroit filed for bankruptcy protection.

OAKLAND COUNTY IN SEPTEMBER

Analysts said Detroit's impact on the state is clear.

"I know the governor said there are a lot of good bonds and good cities in Michigan and that is true, but there are also a lot of bonds and a lot of good cities in the country and they do not have the mess that became Detroit," said Richard Larkin, director of credit analysis at HJ Sims. "Investors have plenty of fish in the sea to choose from, so why bother fishing in lake Michigan?"

Daniel Berger, analyst at Municipal Market Data, said Detroit's decision to seek bankruptcy protection stands in contrast to how other cities have coped with massive debt problems. "Detroit has been different, and investors feel skittish for any local government," he said.

But the emergency manager for Detroit, which is still awaiting a court ruling on its eligibility for protection from creditors, said he simply cannot worry about any broader impact.

"I'm a fiduciary for this city," Kevyn Orr, the emergency manager, told Reuters on Wednesday. "I cannot be concerned about what dreams may come from the result of what we do."

Other Michigan localities to put off bond sales recently include the city of Battle Creek and Genesee County.

Battle Creek, which is located about 120 miles west of Detroit and nicknamed Cereal City because it is home to the Kellogg Co headquarters, decided on Monday to delay until mid-September a $16 million bond sale that had been set for next week.

"We don't necessarily want to be the first ones out the door with a bond issue after the Detroit bankruptcy and with the market doing the volatile things that it's doing," Linda Morrison, the city's finance director, said on Wednesday. "We'd rather wait and see."

The third locality, Genesee County, about 70 miles north of Detroit, last week held off offering a $54 million water and sewage bond because of low investor interest, according to media reports.

SALES ON TAP

Still, some Michigan municipalities are forging ahead with plans to issue bonds.

The Michigan Finance Authority is planning to sell $18.1 million of revenue bonds on August 14 for Ypsilanti Community Schools, a market source said on Thursday.

The Michigan Strategic Fund will offer $11.9 million of limited obligation revenue bonds for the Methodist Retirement Communities Inc. on either Tuesday or Wednesday next week.

Oakland County, which borders Detroit to the north, is going ahead with plans to issue up to $340 million in taxable bonds to refinance a 2007 deal to pay off other post-employment benefits liabilities, Bob Daddow, the deputy county executive, said on Thursday. The sale is slated for the third week of September.

The county, which has a AAA bond rating, is financially strong, and Daddow said he does not think buyers will shy away from the bonds.

"We are not Detroit," he said.

headline: Two Kazakh students charged with obstruction in Boston bomb probe
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

A U.S. grand jury on Thursday indicted two students from Kazakhstan on obstruction of justice charges, alleging they helped hide evidence related to the April Boston marathon bombing that killed three and injured 264.

Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both 19, were college friends of surviving bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

They are charged with removing a backpack containing fireworks and a laptop from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the FBI released pictures of Dzhokhar and his older brother Tamerlan in an effort to learn the names of the bombers, the U.S. Attorney's office for Massachusetts said.

The pair were first charged on May 1 with conspiracy and remain in federal custody. They could face up to 20 years in prison on obstruction of justice charges, in addition to five years if convicted on conspiracy charges.

Both also face the possibility of deportation.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a gun battle with police following the release of the images while Dzhokhar, 20, is in federal custody awaiting trial on charges that could bring the death penalty.

An attorney for Tazhayakov, Arkady Bukh, said he had been trying for the past three months to persuade federal prosecutors to drop charges against his client.

"There was no motive and no order from Tsarnaev to destroy evidence," Bukh said in a phone interview. "Unfortunately, we couldn't convince them. At this time there is little left but to go to trial."

Kadyrbayev's attorneys could not be reached for immediate comment.

The initial charges against the two Kazakh students and another criminal count, making false statements in a terrorism investigation filed against Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, came weeks after the April 15 bombing.

They trace back to the evening of April 18, three days after the attack, when the FBI released still images from videos taken at the race's crowded finish line showing the two brothers, wearing baseball caps and carrying backpacks near the site where two homemade pressure-cooker bombs exploded.

After seeing the pictures and realizing one was their friend, the Kazakh students got in touch with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who told them by text message they "can go to my room and take what's there."

Later that night, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan hastily planned to flee Boston, first killing a university police officer in an attempt to steal his gun, then car jacking a man and finally engaging in a gun battle with police in Watertown, Massachusetts that ended when Dzhokhar ran over and killed his brother, escaping police.

Dzhokhar's escape prompted a day-long manhunt that shut down most of the greater Boston area and ended only when he was found, hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a home.

Tsarnaev made his first appearance in court last month, where he pleaded not guilty to all charges associated with the attack and its aftermath.

Phillipos' lawyer said in a court filing on Thursday they are "engaged in negotiations aimed at a possible resolution of this matter" and a judge granted his request to waive a probable cause hearing that had been scheduled for Monday.

8:31am EDT

A federal judge refused to block the Friday release of "Lovelace" after a lawsuit by the owners of the rights to "Deep Throat," a pornographic film that starred the biopic's namesake.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan denied Arrow Productions Ltd's request for a temporary restraining order on Wednesday, a day after the company filed a $10 million lawsuit against the producers and distributor of the R-rated movie starring Amanda Seyfried.

The judge's oral decision was confirmed by Millennium Films, one of the "Lovelace" producers, as well as a lawyer for Arrow, which owns the rights to the 1972 porn film that starred Linda Lovelace.

In its lawsuit, Arrow contended that the producers of "Lovelace" used more than five minutes of footage from "Deep Throat" without permission.

Arrow also complained about the biopic's title, citing a trademark it held for the name "Linda Lovelace."

Mark Gill, president of Millennium, said the production company was "relieved that common sense prevailed."

"We believe this case was an insult to the legal safeguards in place maintaining our right to freedom of speech," Gill said.

Evan Mandel, a lawyer for Arrow at Mandel Bhandari, said his client was considering the next move.

"Our client's position is the movie violates its intellectual property rights," he added.

"Lovelace" tells the tale of the formative years of porn star Linda Lovelace (born Linda Boreman), her abusive marriage to Chuck Traynor, played by Peter Sarsgaard, and her work on "Deep Throat."

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January and was to be released in theaters and be available to video on demand customers on Friday.

Radius-TWC, a division of Weinstein distributing the movie, welcomed Griesa's ruling in a statement and confirmed the movie would be released as planned.

Bulger's lawyers had argued that he was not responsible for the deaths of two women among his alleged victims. They said Bulger's partner, Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi murdered the women, Flemmi's girlfriend and stepdaughter.

The trial included testimony from former hit men, FBI agents, drug dealers and other witnesses who described brazen killings, massive drug and weapons heists and harrowing extortion encounters.

The case was decades in the making. During the years that Bulger ruled Boston's underworld, corrupt FBI agents turned a blind eye to his crimes in exchange for information about the Italian Mafia, then a top FBI target, according to prosecutors.

Bulger's attorneys deny their client was ever an informant, or "rat" in gangster lingo, contending he paid agents for tips but never offer any of his own.

The gang boss fled Boston after a 1994 tip from a corrupt agent that arrest was imminent. He spent 16 years on the lam, many of them on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted" list.

Agents caught up with him in June 2011, living in a seaside Santa Monica, California, apartment with a stash of guns, more than $800,000 in cash and his girlfriend Catherine Greig -- a former dental technician who in the gang's heyday had supplied pliers they used to pull victims' teeth from their mouths.

described "toughest sheriff" was shot and killed in the driveway of his Phoenix home as he prepared to go to work before dawn on Thursday, authorities said.

Police officers using dogs quickly mounted a two-hour search of the residential neighborhood after the shooting of the officer, who authorities said had been wearing clothing with a sheriff's office insignia on it. There was no immediate word on motive.

"We will certainly look into whether it was related to his duties, but at this point we don't know," Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Trent Crump said. No arrests have been made.

Witnesses reported several shots fired at about 4 a.m. local time and spotted a man fleeing the scene on foot, police said. Television footage from the scene showed a pick-up truck in the driveway with its hood up and the driver's door open.

When authorities responded to the scene, they found the officer severely wounded in front of the home. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. His identity was not immediately released.

Sheriff's spokesman Chris Hegstrom said the officer had worked for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office for eight years and was assigned to the custody support bureau but could not be more specific. The Arizona Republic reported that he worked in the jail system's food factory.

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has been a lightning rod for controversy over his aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. The six-term sheriff has been the subject of several investigations and lawsuits stemming from his get-tough policies.



headline: Maine man who sent son to day care with loaded gun pleads not guilty
byline: By Dave Sherwood
8:31am EDT

old who brought a loaded handgun to day care in Maine has pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct, claiming the incident was unintentional.

The man, 31-year old Adam Keene, of Madison, placed the loaded, semi-automatic .380 caliber pistol in his son's day care bag when bringing it into his house and then forgot he had done so, said Kennebec County District Attorney Maeghan Maloney.

The gun, which Keene legally owned, had a round in the chamber and the safety activated.

The gun was later discovered by an employee of the child's preschool day care in the rural central Maine community of Hallowell, near the state's capital of Augusta.

Maloney said she chose not to pursue felony charges because she believed the incident was an accident. She said in a phone interview that the state had extended a plea offer to Keene, who has not yet responded to it.

"If I thought that he'd intended to have the gun go to day care, this would be a very different case," said Maloney. "But I'm optimistic we'll be able to come to some common ground."

She said the victims were the worried parents of other children attending the day care.

Keene's attorney did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.

Day care owner Elizabeth Rollins said an employee at her home day care in Hallowell had discovered the gun, and that her husband had quickly removed it from the premises.

"We were in denial," said Rollins. "We wanted to believe it was a toy gun. But it was real."

She said the nearly four months since the incident occurred in April have been stressful, but a learning experience for her and hopefully, other day care owners.

"I've put a lot of time into talking to parents about the incident, and making sure that my kids, and theirs, are protected," she said. "We'll be happy for some closure."

A pair of rare Sumatran tiger cubs has been born at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C., under a program designed to help the species survive.

"This birth is really good news because we can't afford to have these species go extinct," said National Zoo biologist Craig Saffoe.

"All I can do is smile because the team has realized our goal of producing critically endangered tiger cubs," Saffoe said. The zoo said fewer than 500 Sumatran tigers remain in the wild.

The cubs were born on Monday to Damai, 4, a first-time mother, and 12-year-old Kavi, under one of about 15 species surival programs, coordinated through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, to breed Sumatran tigers, Saffoe said.

<a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/GreatCats/Tiger/tiger-cubs.cfm?cam=lc4&lt;/p&gt;"></a>

Under breeding programs, it can take up to five years from tigers being matched and mated until a cub is born, Saffoe said. Dalai was born at the San Diego Zoo in a conservation project four years ago, and Kavi came from the Atlanta Zoo.

The last Sumatran tiger born in the national zoo was in 2006.

While North America is at the forefront of these programs with 60 Sumatran tigers, U.S. zoos partner with European and Japanese zoos to ensure successful mating.

The cubs mostly likely will not be on exhibit until fall, but they can be viewed online through webcams in the tigers' den.

out San Diego home earlier this week, saying that the suspect's vehicle had been spotted heading there from Northern California.

According to the Amber Alert, a statewide child-abduction notice, the blue 2012 Nissan Versa was seen on Wednesday afternoon heading northbound on Highway 395 from Alturas, California, near the Oregon border.

The alert did not say if suspect James Lee DiMaggio, 40, or either of Christina Anderson's children were seen inside.

DiMaggio had been a close family friend of Anderson for two decades and was considered "like an uncle" to her children, said Lieutenant Glenn Giannantonio, the homicide detective overseeing the case for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.

Investigators have no evidence of a precipitating incident or circumstances that might have led to the crimes DiMaggio is suspected of committing, the detective said on Wednesday.

Anderson, 44, and her two children - 16-year-old Hannah and 8-year-old Ethan - were last seen Saturday evening.

The following night, the mother was found slain inside DiMaggio's burned-out home in the desert community of Boulevard, California, east of San Diego, along with a dead child whose remains were burned beyond recognition. Authorities have not said how the mother was killed.

Giannantonio said it might take a day or two longer for medical examiners to positively identify the child and determine the cause of death. But investigators believe the remains, which are consistent with those of an 8-year-old, may be of Ethan Anderson, he said.

'IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE ... RUN'

At this point, he said, there is no other child of that age whom investigators have linked to the case. But for now, investigators have not ruled out the possibility that DiMaggio abducted both Hannah and Ethan Anderson.

"We know we're missing an 8-year-old and a 16-year-old," Giannantonio said.

Anderson's ex-husband and the children's father, Brett Anderson, went on television on Tuesday to make a public plea to the suspect to give himself up and for his daughter to try to escape.

"Jim, I can't fathom what you were thinking," he said. "The damage is done. I'm begging you to let my daughter go. You've taken everything else."

He also addressed the missing girl, saying, "Hannah, we all love you very much," adding, "If you have a chance you take it. You run. You'll be found."

An Amber Alert was issued in California on Monday for both children, and authorities said DiMaggio was initially believed to be headed by car for Texas or Canada.

Earlier on Wednesday, Giannantonio said investigators had no clue as to the suspect's intended destination. He said FBI agents have joined in the search and that Mexican law enforcement authorities and the U.S. Border Patrol also were on the lookout for DiMaggio.

"It's very possible he could be hunkered down somewhere here in the county," the detective told Reuters. "He's something of an outdoorsman. He could be somewhere around here camping."

Giannantonio said there has been no communication from DiMaggio, who made a living as an information technology worker, since he disappeared.

headline: George W. Bush 'doing great' day after surgery for blocked artery
byline: By Marice Richter
8:31am EDT

Former President George W. Bush was recovering at his home in Dallas on Wednesday, a day after undergoing surgery for a blocked artery, a Bush spokesman said.

Bush, 67, is "doing great," his spokesman Freddy Ford said, after a stent, a wire mesh coil used to prop open arteries, was placed in the former president's heart at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on Tuesday.

The blockage was discovered on Monday during Bush's annual physical at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas. His doctors recommended the stent and Bush agreed to the procedure, Ford said.

Bush was not experiencing any symptoms from the blockage, which was detected because his physical included a stress test and electrocardiogram, according to an aide who asked not to be identified.

Those results prompted a computerized tomography angiogram, which led to the discovery of the blockage, the aide said.

Avid about fitness, Bush exercised regularly while he was in the White House from 2001 to 2009. He was a dedicated runner until knee pain led him to take up cycling. Since leaving office, he rides a mountain bike, golfs and works out almost daily in a home gymnasium, the aide said.

Bush is expected to resume his normal schedule on Thursday, Ford said.

Since leaving office, Bush has devoted his time to planning his presidential library, museum and policy institute in Dallas. He recently traveled to Africa to draw attention to the need for better healthcare. He has also become an avid painter.

Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush, 89, spent seven weeks in a Houston hospital for bronchitis and related ailments before his release on January 14. He usually makes public appearances in a wheelchair.



headline: U.S. defense lawyers to seek access to DEA hidden intelligence evidence
byline: By David Ingram and John Shiffman
8:31am EDT

Criminal defense lawyers are challenging a U.S. government practice of hiding the tips that led to some drug investigations, information that the lawyers say is essential to fair trials in U.S. courts.

The practice of creating an alternate investigative trail to hide how a case began - what federal agents call "parallel construction" - has never been thoroughly tested in court, lawyers and law professors said in interviews this week.

Internal training documents reported by Reuters this week instruct agents not to reveal information they get from a unit of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, but instead to recreate the same information by other means. A similar set of instructions was included in an IRS manual in 2005 and 2006, Reuters reported.

The DEA unit, known as the Special Operations Division, or SOD, receives intelligence from intercepts, wiretaps, informants and phone records, and funnels tips to other law enforcement agencies, the documents said. Some but not all of the information is classified.

In interviews, at least a dozen current or former agents said they used "parallel construction," often by pretending that an investigation began with what appeared to be a routine traffic stop, when the true origin was actually a tip from SOD.

Defense lawyers said that by hiding the existence of the information, the government is violating a defendant's constitutional right to view potentially exculpatory evidence that suggests witness bias, entrapment or innocence.

"It certainly can't be that the agents can make up a 'parallel construction,' a made-up tale, in court documents, testimony before the grand jury or a judge, without disclosure to a court," said Jim Wyda, the federal public defender in Maryland, in an email.

"This is going to result in a lot of litigation, for a long time."

LEGAL ACTION AHEAD

Kenneth Bailey, who defends drug cases in Sandusky, Ohio, said his firm was drafting new motions in light of the documents made public by Reuters.

"Evidence which could prove my clients' innocence is being intentionally concealed," Bailey said. "This is why criminal defense lawyers are working so hard to protect the (U.S.) Constitution, because the government is working so hard to destroy it."

The Justice Department is reviewing the practice of parallel construction, and two high-profile Republican congressmen have raised questions about it.

DEA officials who defended the program on condition of anonymity said the practice was legal - and necessary to protect confidential sources and investigative methods. The Special Operations Division has used it virtually every day since the 1990s, they said.

Court decisions going back decades hold that prosecutors in the United States have a responsibility to turn over to a defendant any information that they or police have that is material to establishing the defendant's guilt or innocence. The responsibility is known as the government's Brady obligations, after the U.S. Supreme Court's 1963 ruling in the case of Brady v. Maryland.

The process of sharing evidence before trial or a guilty plea is known as discovery.

"This probably is a good wake-up call for us that we need to be more aggressive in our discovery requests, in digging a lot deeper and in not accepting that we've been told everything," said David Patton, executive director of the Federal Defenders of New York. Like similar offices nationwide, his represents mostly the indigent.

Patton said information about how an investigation began may be highly relevant in certain cases because it bears on the credibility of government witnesses.

"Informants lie. They lie a lot," he said. "You can't competently or fully challenge the basis for a stop or search if the government's hiding information about the real reason for the stop and search."

HARD TO KNOW

One possible difficulty for defense lawyers is that they do not know which cases the DEA's Special Operations Division had a hand in, so they do not have a list of cases in which to bring fresh challenges.

"Because they hid everything, you don't know about it, and because you don't know about it, you can't make a specific allegation," said A.J. Kramer, the federal public defender in Washington.

Investigative agencies, he said, ought to notify defense lawyers of the relevant cases, similar to a process the FBI is following to notify defendants in possibly thousands of cases in which hair samples might have been misused as evidence.

Defense lawyers will have to proceed without clear guidance from legal precedent, because there are no known cases in which judges ruled on whether defendants had a constitutional right to know about the tactic of parallel construction, according to lawyers, law professors and a search of electronic databases in Westlaw.

The term "parallel construction" was itself previously unheard of, these sources said, although there is voluminous discussion of related legal ideas.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled, for example, that police may stop a vehicle for any traffic offense, even if the offense was minor and police had a different motive for detaining the motorist, such as a tip. The 1996 ruling did not, however, address what rights a defendant would have if that original tip were kept secret.

Stephanos Bibas, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who writes about criminal evidence, said the U.S. system would benefit from judges getting more involved in reviewing such evidence.

"The pressure is all on the prosecutors and police to identify what's relevant," he said. "I don't think that they are maliciously or deliberately hiding it very often. It's more a tunnel vision problem that police and prosecutors can't always see the way that the defense would use certain information."

MEJIA CASE

When asked for the legal authority by which they shielded potential evidence from the defense, DEA officials cited the 2001 trial of Rafael Mejia, a Costa Rican citizen convicted in federal court in Washington.

The DEA declined to say whether parallel construction was used in the case, but records show that at trial neither Mejia, nor his lawyer, nor even the trial prosecutor knew the investigation had involved classified information.

They learned this only four years later as Mejia appealed his conviction, and a federal appeals court sent a notice that surprised lawyers on both sides. The court informed the lawyers that just days before the trial had begun in 2001, someone from a Justice Department narcotics office secretly approached the judge in his chambers to present him with classified evidence. The judge then made a secret ruling that Mejia was not entitled to this evidence because it was neither helpful nor relevant.

Such so-called ex parte decisions by judges on classified pretrial discovery issues are not unusual in terrorism cases, but prosecutors routinely file a related public notice to the defense about the existence of the secret filings. That did not happen in Mejia's case.

The notice the appeals court sent the Mejia trial lawyers asked them each to address whether the information would have been relevant at trial. The court asked the lawyers to do this without disclosing what the classified information actually was. Defense lawyer H. Heather Shaner said the request felt Kafka-esque.

"I didn't know about the information at trial and on appeal I couldn't access it," she recalled. "It made me irrelevant as a lawyer."

The trial prosecutor, Robert Feitel, said he was as surprised as anyone to learn about the secret evidence. Now a defense lawyer in large drug cases, Feitel said he routinely tries to frame his requests for government evidence to include potential classified information whenever he believes intelligence intercepts or foreign wiretaps might have been used.

"I know that 99 percent of the time that happens there will be something relevant," he said, "and I know that any good defense attorney would want to know about evidence that came through SOD."



headline: Detroit looking at art it could sell, emergency manager says
byline: By Joseph Lichterman
8:31am EDT

Detroit is sorting through the Detroit Institute of Arts' collection to see what it could sell to raise funds, the city's emergency manager said on Wednesday, touching on a contentious issue in the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy filing.

"It's not a high priority" to sell the art, Emergency Manager Keyvn Orr said in an interview with Reuters.

But a detailed evaluation of the 60,000-piece collection is part of a broad review of city assets, including its water and sewage department, Coleman A. Young International Airport and the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, he said.

The prospect of putting the museum's art up for sale has sparked furious debate throughout the city and its suburbs. The museum and Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette have said Detroit cannot sell the art because the works are held in a charitable trust for people in Michigan - a position with which the emergency manager disagrees.

Orr said he has never visited the DIA, though he has studied the museum's art collection, which includes an 1887 self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh and a 27-panel fresco by Mexican artist Diego Rivera.

"I actually took an art history course years and years ago, and the stuff I read about is there," Orr said.

On Monday the city said it had hired auction house Christie's to appraise the DIA's collection. Orr said he would make a decision about what to do with the art after Christie's completes its review, perhaps by mid-October.

Despite the size of the DIA's collection, only 5,000 or so works are on display at one time. Orr said about 35,000 works are not subject to bequests or other obligations that would limit the ability to sell them.

"Once we find out what we're talking about, that'll probably lead the discussion about what we can and can't do," he said. "I'm not being flippant, I'm just being very careful because every time I say something about the DIA it's another three weeks of, 'Orr the Luddite is getting ready to sell our family jewels.'"

The city, which owns the DIA collection, and its creditors are discussing ways to restructure $18 billion in debt and unfunded pension liabilities after it filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history last month.

Orr said he has not ruled out any options, including an outright sale of the collection, or using some or all of it as collateral for new loans to the city.

Only 5 percent of the collection was bought with city funds, according to Tim Burns, executive assistant to the museum's director.

The emergency manager said many works "may not have been seen for decades," and that the city must determine what is worth selling.

"If you have to sell 10,000 pieces to get ten dollars, why would you do that?" Orr asked.

'15 BUCKETS'

Aside from the DIA, Orr said there are "15 buckets" of assets that the city is valuing and considering monetizing. He mentioned Coleman A. Young International Airport, the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, parking lots and other city-owned assets and land.

The airport sits on 264 acres on the city's east side. There is a 53,000-square-foot (4,925-square-meter) passenger terminal, but the airport only serves private planes and cargo aircraft.

About 225 planes are served daily at the airport, and 175 planes are based there, according to the city's website.

Detroit's primary commercial airport is Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, located about 20 miles west of the city.

Orr called Coleman Young "underutilized" and said he was uncertain how much it could fetch.

The tunnel connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, is jointly owned by both cities. But it is operated by the privately owned American Roads LLC, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month in a bid to restructure $830 million in debt.

Traffic levels have fallen short of projections since it took on the debt in 2006, a factor American Roads blames on Detroit's population decline.

Orr described Belle Isle, a 982-acre (398-hectare) island park in the Detroit River, as a special case.

In January Michigan offered to lease Belle Isle from the city, agreeing to assume $6 million in annual operating costs. But the Detroit City Council balked at the proposal, and Governor Rick Snyder pulled the deal.

Orr said the city was probably going to seek a similar deal that would turn Belle Isle into a state park, but said there was no target date for completing it.

He added that the city would save another $10 million if the state agreed to perform some deferred maintenance.

A deal with the state "makes more sense than anything else," Orr said. "We want to keep it as a refuge for the city to use."

old Democrat said he would be in intensive therapy at the time.

Filner faces mounting pressure to resign after a string of women publicly accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. He refused to step down but has acknowledged disrespectful conduct and on Sunday entered a clinic for two weeks of behavioral counseling.

San Diego Superior Court Judge Richard Strauss, in agreeing to a delay, did not set a new date for Filner's deposition in the suit filed by his former press deputy but ordered both sides to appear at a hearing on various legal issues on September 16.

In asking to have the deposition postponed, Filner's attorneys included a signed note from a psychologist, who wrote that the mayor would be "under my care in an intensive treatment program" at the time.

"We don't know who this person is," Joe Cordileone, San Diego's chief deputy city attorney, said of the doctor who signed the note. "We don't know what kind of treatment the mayor is getting. We don't know what is going on."

Filner's attorneys, Harvey Berger and Alexander Ruiz, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.

They also asked that Filner's deposition be sealed and the case be moved to neighboring Imperial County on the grounds that "relentless publicity" in the case would make it impossible for their client to get a fair trial.

Gloria Allred, the lawyer representing former Filner press secretary Irene McCormack Jackson in her lawsuit, filed last month, said in a statement she would oppose moving the case.

"Mayor Filner is the mayor of the city of San Diego. This case should be heard in San Diego. The conduct we allege in our lawsuit occurred in San Diego," Allred said. "We believe that the case should be heard and decided by a jury of Mayor Filner's peers who reside in San Diego."

In addition to Jackson, 12 other women have come forward in recent weeks to accuse the veteran politician of groping them, making lewd comments or other unwanted sexual advances - including two military veterans who told CNN in interviews aired on Wednesday that Filner behaved inappropriately with them while running for mayor last year.

A number of prominent Democrats have called for Filner to resign, including U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the San Diego Democratic Party, the former mayor of San Diego and the city council, and state legislators. He is also the subject of a bipartisan recall campaign.



headline: Half of small cars score badly on tougher U.S. crash tests
byline: By Ben Klayman
8:31am EDT

The auto industry continued its poor performance in an influential U.S. safety group's new crash test as half of the small cars tested did not fare well.

Six of the cars tested, most of which were 2013 models, were rated "poor" or "marginal." General Motors Co's Chevrolet Sonic and Cruze each received marginal scores, while Kia Motors Corp's Soul and 2014 Forte were rated "poor" in the results released on Thursday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

Nissan Motor Co's Sentra also was rated "poor," while Volkswagen AG's Beetle was ranked "marginal."

The IIHS increased the rigor of its tests last year to include crashes that involve only a front corner of a vehicle. The insurance group said nearly one-fourth of U.S. front-of-vehicle crashes that result in serious injury or death involve only a single corner that strikes another vehicle or an object like a tree or utility pole.

The IIHS continues to score vehicles on side, rear, rollover and front-end crashes that impact more than just a corner.

"This is a challenging new crash test and it's not surprising that some vehicles are earning marginal and poor ratings," IIHS spokesman Russ Radar said of the small overlap front crash test.

"This crash scenario doesn't lend itself to a Band-Aid fix so for most manufacturers the countermeasure will have to be built in when there's a full redesign," he added.

STRUCTURAL CHANGES

Vehicle manufacturers in the U.S. market often design and engineer their models to score well on IIHS safety tests and use the results in their marketing.

"It matters because in today's world cars are so competitive that all you need is a small flaw and your competition can exploit it," Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer said.

Most of the 12 small cars tested were already in production before the IIHS increased the rigor of its front crash test last year. However, Radar said IIHS alerted the companies to the work the group was doing on small overlap research in 2009.

The specifications of the test were not finalized until the last year, which is late in a car's development process, Brauer said. All automakers will eventually redesign their cars to meet the standards to pass the new crash test, he said.

In the tests, IIHS crashes a vehicle at 40 mph into a 5-foot-high barrier on the driver's side that overlaps one-quarter of the vehicle's width.

Kia pointed out that the IIHS small overlap crash test goes well beyond federal requirements and the group has recognized numerous Kia vehicles as top safety picks. The South Korean automaker said it would evaluate the results carefully, but the company was proud of its safety record.

GM said customer safety remains its highest priority and it is committed to its cars performing well in all types of crashes.

"We are aggressively working to incorporate these into our models, including our small cars like the Chevrolet Sonic and Cruze, where technically feasible," GM spokeswoman Sharon Basel said in an email.

Nissan and VW said they were proud of their cars' safety records in federal crash tests and other IIHS crash tests, but they would review the small overlap test results and incorporate what is learned into future designs.

WORST CASES

In the worst cases with the small cars that did not score well, safety cages collapsed, driver airbags moved sideways and the crash dummy's head hit the instrument panel, and side curtain airbags did not deploy or provide enough protection, IIHS chief research officer David Zuby said.

The small car segment was the fourth group of cars rated using this new test, and most of the groups have fared equally badly.

Last summer, seven of 11 luxury sedans evaluated rated "marginal" or "poor," and 12 of 15 small SUVs tested also failed to score well in results released in May. Family sedans scored the best, with only five of 18 scoring "marginal" or "poor" in results released last December.

As a group, the small cars fared worse than the mid-sized family sedans, but better than the small SUVs, IIHS said. Results on the new crash test for minicars will be released later this year.

The other six small cars tested included two- and four-door versions of Honda Motor Co Ltd's Civic, which both received "good" ratings. The Civic was tested earlier this year and the results were released in March.

Receiving "acceptable" ratings were Chrysler's Dodge Dart, Ford Motor Co's Focus, Hyundai Motor Co's Elantra and Toyota Motor Corp's 2014 Scion tC.

All the cars scoring well received "Top Safety Pick +" ratings by the insurance trade group. Vehicles earning the institute's "Top Safety Pick +" award have received "good" ratings in the four traditional tests plus "good" or "acceptable" ratings in the small overlap test.

IIHS said it did not test the Toyota Corolla because the automaker plans to release a redesigned 2014 model this month.

Arab slurs at them on New Year's Eve 2011 in central New Jersey.

The men are members of Aryan Terror Brigade and plotted the attack during a holiday "meet and greet" party where they drank alcohol and listened to white supremacist music, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.

U.S. District Judge Joel Pisano sentenced one of the men, Michal Gunar, to 33 months in prison and the other, Kyle Powell, to 15 months in prison. Gunar, 29, of East Windsor, New Jersey, pleaded guilty in April to committing a hate crime assault and conspiracy to do so.

Powell, 24, of West Collingswood, New Jersey, pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy to commit a hate crime assault.

The men faced up to 10 years in prison on the assault charges and 5 years on the conspiracy charges.

With a third man, Christopher Ising, 31, of Waretown, New Jersey, they drove to an apartment complex in Sayreville intending to randomly assault non-white individuals, the prosecutor said.

Brandishing a knife, Gunar attacked two Egyptian men, pulling one of them from a car and punching him in the face and head, causing injuries, Fishman said. Ising assaulted one of the victims with brass knuckles, prosecutors said.

Two days after the attack, Powell received an ATB tattoo on his left arm symbolizing his acceptance into the international hate group with several hundred members, the largest concentration of whom live in New Jersey, prosecutors said.

"This office takes extremely seriously allegations of violence, threats and vandalism against Arab-Americans, Muslims and others threatened because of their race, religion, nationality, sex or orientation," U.S. Attorney spokeswoman Rebekah Carmichael said in an emailed statement.

Powell's lawyer, Paulette Pitt, thanked the judge for the lenient sentence.

"We appreciate the thought that Judge Pisano took in imposing a sentence that balanced the serious nature of the offense against the mitigating factors of Kyle's comparatively minor role and his personal background," Pitt said in an emailed statement.

Ising, a purported member of another white supremacist group, the Atlantic City Skins, pleaded guilty in February to the same charges as Gunar. His sentencing is scheduled for Friday.

sized rocks to break windows and enter homes of notable people such as former vice president Dan Quayle, was sentenced to nearly 23 years in prison on Wednesday, officials said.

Under the ruling from Judge Pamela Svoboda in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix, Robert James Neese, 60, will have his prison sentence reduced by more than two years for time already served for the $10 million crime spree.

Neese was arrested by police in May 2011 after eluding capture in connection with the notorious burglaries of high-end homes owned by the rich and famous, including Quayle and ex-pro baseball players Mark Grace and Steve Finley.

In all, some 400 Phoenix-area homes were burglarized since he first struck three times in the wealthy enclave of Paradise Valley in 1993, police said.

Neese was convicted of multiple counts of burglary in April.

"Today's sentence should dispel any doubts about the commitment of this office to hold criminals accountable regardless of how long it may take," County Attorney Bill Montgomery said in a statement.

Authorities said Neese would plan out his burglaries by watching for signs that a homeowner was gone, such as newspapers accumulating in the driveway, and then make his move. But there was no consistent pattern for when or where he would act.

After breaking windows with rocks and entering the homes, authorities said he would take items such as jewelry, cash and handguns and then flee within minutes. Master bathroom windows were targeted because they were often without alarms or sensors.

He proved an elusive foe for law enforcement. Police recovered two handguns taken during the burglaries, but could not tie them to an individual. In 1995, a homeowner caught the Rock Burglar in the act, but the man was able to escape after a brief struggle.

A $15,000 reward had been posted, and authorities spent tens of thousands of dollars on special operations to nab him.

He was arrested on May 15, 2011, after authorities were able to match his DNA and other physical evidence with that left at some of the crime scenes.



headline: Row simmers over death benefits for Arizona 'Hotshot' firefighters

tier compensation system meant her young family would be denied full survivor benefits.

The elite firefighters died in June in the worst U.S. wildland fire tragedy in 80 years. They were engulfed by wind-whipped flames in seconds as they tried to extinguish a blaze that forced evacuations and destroyed scores of homes in and around the tiny town of Yarnell.

Since their deaths, a political fight has emerged over a system of compensation for survivors in which benefits for next-of-kin will depend on whether a firefighter was considered a full-time or seasonal employee.

"As shocked as I was that my husband went to work and never came home, I'm equally shocked in how the city has treated our family since then," Juliann Ashcraft, 28, said in an interview with CBS News that aired this week.

All dependents of the deceased members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots will receive a federal payment of $328,000. But while dependents of six full-time firefighters will get additional financial benefits and lifetime health insurance from the city, the next-of-kin of 13 others deemed seasonal workers are not entitled to such help.

Ashcraft, who says her husband Andrew worked full-time hours on a year-round basis, has said she was counting on the lifetime benefits to help raise her four children - the youngest just 18 months old - but was told she was not entitled to them.

"I said to them, 'My husband was a full-time employee, he went to work full time for you,'" she told CBS, "and their response to me was, 'Perhaps there was a communication issue in your marriage.'"

Ashcraft could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.

Prescott city spokesman Peter Wertheim declined to comment on the case of any specific Hotshot crew member. He said the city was unable to reclassify the 13 seasonal firefighters posthumously as full-time employees.

'WE NEED TO MAKE IT RIGHT'

Amid a particularly deadly fire season in the U.S. West - where at least 22 people have been killed by wildfires - the Arizona legislature is now taking up the fight to ensure all first responders are treated the same.

House Speaker Andy Tobin is drafting retroactive measures to give full benefits to any responder who dies in the line of duty on state lands - among them the Hotshots, who were trapped when the lightning-sparked Yarnell Hill Fire suddenly changed direction.

timer benefit package," Tobin told Reuters. "We need to make it right, and I think that this process will help do that."

While the bill, which would qualify survivors such as Juliann Ashcraft for full benefits including life insurance and health care, is at an early stage, Tobin said it had bipartisan support in the Arizona legislature.

A second bill that Tobin, a Republican, is working on would ensure that the state covers the costs of the death-related pensions provided by Prescott, a small city of about 40,000 residents.

"It probably should have been handled long ago," he said, "but nobody could ever have comprehended 19 men losing their lives in a fire like this."

An investigation into the Yarnell Hill Fire is currently underway, and findings are expected to be released in September.

frisk program but later cleared of criminal wrongdoing.

The department will scrub the information as part of a settlement ending a lawsuit filed in 2010 in state court by the New York Civil Liberties Union, which announced the agreement on Wednesday.

The settlement applies to people issued a summons or arrested after a police stop but whose cases were dismissed or ended with a fine for a noncriminal violation.

"Though much still needs to be done, this settlement is an important step towards curbing the impact of abusive stop-and-frisk practices," said Christopher Dunn, the NYCLU's associate legal director.

City officials said that a law passed in 2010 prohibiting the NYPD from collecting names for people stopped and then immediately released without a summons or arrest had rendered the database ineffective as an investigative tool.

"Today's settlement is consistent with the 2010 law that the NYPD has been fully compliant with," said city lawyer Janice Casey Silverberg. "The law made the need for the database moot."

Dunn said there have been more than half a million stops that included an arrest or a summons since 2004, when he said the NYPD began retaining people's names in a database for use in future criminal investigations.

The NYPD's stop-and-frisk strategy, in which patrolling officers stop, question and sometimes frisk suspicious individuals in high-crime neighborhoods, has drawn scrutiny from civil liberties groups concerned that the policy disproportionately affects minorities.

A federal judge in Manhattan is weighing whether to declare the tactic unconstitutional after a 10-week civil trial, a move that could usher in a Department of Justice monitor for the NYPD.

The lawsuit settled Wednesday was filed on behalf of two men who were separately stopped by police in the Bronx and Brooklyn. The men each received two summonses that were later dismissed, but their personal information remained in the NYPD's database.

New York state law calls for criminal records to be sealed when a case ends in the defendant's favor, such as a dismissal or an acquittal. In addition, records for defendants convicted of a noncriminal offense, such as a disorderly conduct violation, are also required to be sealed.

The lawsuit claimed the NYPD's database violated that law by retaining information about defendants who were never convicted of a crime.

Under the terms of the settlement, the city made no admission that the NYPD had violated the plaintiffs' rights. The city also paid the NYCLU $10,000 as part of the agreement.

The NYPD will continue to track some non-identifying data, including race, for people who are stopped to allow ongoing monitoring of the stop-and-frisk program.



headline: U.S. officials say NSA leaks may hamper cyber policy debate
byline: By Alina Selyukh
8:31am EDT

Weeks of revelations about secret U.S. surveillance programs could stymie progress on negotiations over new laws and regulations meant to beef up the country's defenses against the growing threat of cyber attacks, cyber security experts say.

Current and former cybersecurity officials say they worry the ongoing disclosures about secret National Security Agency spying programs by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden could trigger hasty or rash actions by Congress or the private sector, hampering efforts to enact an effective cyber policy.

The Obama administration, lawmakers and the private sector in recent years have been negotiating how the government and industry should partner to protect critical infrastructure like power plants against a growing threat of cyber attacks.

Despite the emerging consensus that U.S. cyber defenses must be improved, the conversation has sputtered amid disagreements about liability and privacy protections, the creation of new industry standards and other critical elements.

Now, cybersecurity leaders say the leaked details of the vast scope of NSA's online data gathering may hamper efforts to draft cyber policies, such as greater information-sharing between government and industry.

"It's opened up a big can of worms about what the government's role is, which is already a big open question in cyberspace," said Bruce McConnell, the Department of Homeland Security's Acting Deputy Undersecretary for Cybersecurity. "I don't think this is going to be helpful in making Congress, who tends to be risk-averse, forge new policy agreements."

"The Snowden revelations have made the Congress more uncomfortable with providing clear authorities to the government," McConnell told Reuters on the sidelines of the SINET Innovation Summit in New York on Tuesday.

The House of Representatives made the first legislative challenge to NSA's data gathering in July through an amendment to the defense appropriations bill.

The proposal, opposed by the White House and the intelligence community, failed by a narrow 12-vote margin. In private conversations, government officials said they hope Congress does not "let a good crisis go to waste." Instead, they want to use the heightened public attention to cyber operations to spur a constructive conversation about better cybersecurity.

"It is sensitizing people to ask the question, 'what is the role of government?' It's forcing that dialogue to happen," Douglas Maughan, who runs the cybersecurity division at the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate, told Reuters at SINET.

The House recently passed a bill that would increase the sharing of cyber threat information between the private sector and the government. But in a repeat of last year's failed attempt to pass such a law, the White House has threatened to veto the bill over privacy concerns. The Senate has yet to introduce its version of an information-sharing bill.

Both Maughan and McConnell, who is leaving DHS for the EastWest Institute, a think tank focused on conflict resolution, said Snowden's revelations have so far not hurt the department's cybersecurity partnerships with the private sector. But they expressed worries about what Congress might do next.

"That's the concern, that people are going to have a knee-jerk reaction and try to rush a legislative remedy," Maughan said.

Mark Weatherford, who preceded McConnell at the DHS before joining the Chertoff Group consulting firm this year, said the lack of major NSA-related legislative proposals shows appreciation of the value of digital intelligence gathering, which officials say has helped thwart numerous terrorist plots.

But he agreed that public concerns over the scope of government surveillance online convolute policy progress.

"We are in a more complicated debate now," Weatherford said. "It's going to take a couple of years to recover from the perception that the government is overreaching."

Some private sector cybersecurity executives also concede that trust in government's handling of private data has suffered from Snowden revelations. They echoed concerns about an erosion of trust expressed by prominent hackers and cyber experts at two major security conventions in recent weeks.

"All the policies are stepped backwards," SINET founder Robert Rodriguez told Reuters. "You've got to build the trust again."

headline: 'Whitey' Bulger jury mulls Boston mob trial verdict, questions judge
byline: By Richard Valdmanis
8:31am EDT

The statute of limitations does not shield James "Whitey" Bulger from murder and racketeering charges stemming from crimes more than 30 years old, the judge overseeing the Boston mobster's trial told the jury on Wednesday.

U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper also set the jury straight on a question about the complicated racketeering law that was raised on the second day of deliberations after nearly eight weeks of testimony.

The jury of eight men and four women approached the judge twice. They asked whether any of Bulger's alleged crimes were committed too far in the past for him to be held accountable, and whether jurors needed to be unanimous on his alleged acts of racketeering for a finding.

Bulger, 83, faces life in prison if convicted on a list of charges including 19 murders he is accused of committing or ordering while heading Boston's Winter Hill Gang in the 1970s and '80s.

Casper reminded jurors the statute of limitations cannot erase racketeering charges, and also clarified jury procedures around the most complicated of the 32 criminal counts that Bulger faces, the racketeering offense.

That count includes 38 individual acts including all 19 murders. Casper explained that while jurors must be unanimous to find Bulger guilty of any individual act, he only needed to be guilty of two of those acts to be guilty of that racketeering count.

"If you cannot reach unanimous agreement ... you should make no finding to that act and move on to the next act," Casper instructed the jury. The jury will take up its third day of deliberations on Thursday.

Jurors began deliberations on Tuesday after 36 days of mostly gruesome testimony. Former hit men, FBI agents, drug dealers and other witnesses described brazen killings, corruption of law enforcement, massive drugs and weapons heists and harrowing extortion encounters.

Bulger escaped arrest for decades, with the help of corrupt FBI agents who shared his Irish ethnicity and South Boston upbringing. Prosecutors said the agents turned a blind eye to Bulger's crimes in exchange for information about the Italian Mafia, then a top national FBI target.

Bulger's attorneys admitted on the first day of the trial that their client was a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark. Their atypical defense rarely focused directly on the crimes of which Bulger was accused. Instead, they spent much of their time contesting the assertion that Bulger served as an FBI informant, or "a rat" in mob parlance.

Bulger's defense lawyers did deny that he had killed two women. They blamed those murders on Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi, a former gangmate and the prosecution's star witness, who testified that he watched Bulger kill the women.

Around midday on Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz arrived in the courtroom and huddled with prosecutors over documents and the judge called a series of sidebar discussions with lawyers. No explanation was given for the courtroom discussions.

The trial recalled an era when armed thugs in souped-up cars used machine guns to wipe out rival gangsters, buried bodies along the city's waterfront and shook down victims including drug dealers, bookmakers and local business owners who accidentally crossed their paths.

Bulger's story inspired Martin Scorsese's 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed," in which Jack Nicholson played an Irish-American gangster loosely based on Bulger.



headline: Lawyers for U.S. soldier in Afghan killings want prosecutors ousted
byline: By Eric M. Johnson and Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

Attorneys for a U.S. soldier who pleaded guilty in June to killing 16 Afghan civilians in cold blood have moved to dismiss the prosecution team weeks before a scheduled sentencing hearing that will decide if he will ever have a chance at parole.

Military prosecutors were mistakenly given an unredacted copy of a court-ordered report evaluating the mental health of Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, which civilian defense lawyer John Henry Browne said would give them an unfair advantage in the sentencing portion of the case.

"This material by law is not allowed to be given to the prosecutors because the statements of Sgt. Bales were given under duress with a promise they would not be used," Browne told Reuters by email, explaining his reasons for seeking to remove the prosecutors.

Bales, a decorated veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, pleaded guilty in June to walking off his base under cover of darkness last year and opening fire on civilians in their homes in at least two villages.

The mass shooting in Afghanistan's Kandahar province marked the worst case of civilian slaughter blamed on a single, rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further strained U.S.-Afghan relations after over a decade of conflict in that country.

Bales, 39, faces a life term in prison under a deal that spared him the death penalty. A military jury must still decide whether he will ever be eligible for parole.

Upon pleading guilty in June, Bales matter-of-factly acknowledged the killings and told the court there was "not a good reason in this world" for his actions.

Defense attorneys have argued that Bales, a father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his deployment to Afghanistan.

The motion seeking to remove the prosecutors is among those filed by Bales' lawyers to be considered at a pre-sentencing hearing on Tuesday, said Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Gary Dangerfield.

"One of the motions asks that the prosecution team be recused because of a discovery-related issue," Dangerfield said in an email. "No decision has been made."

The father of an unarmed Orlando Muslim shot to death in May by an FBI agent during questioning related to the Boston Marathon bombings has arrived in Florida from Russia for meetings with lawyers trying to pry details of the killing from U.S. and local officials.

Abdulbaki Todashev has retained lawyers who expect to settle on a legal strategy within a few weeks, said Hassan Shibly, executive director of the Florida Council on American Islamic Relations.

Todashev's son, Ibragim Todashev, 27, was killed in his Orlando apartment during what turned out to be the last of several voluntary interviews with agents from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies investigating the Boston bombings.

Abdulbaki Todashev, who is from Russia's mostly Muslim republic of Chechnya, has said he suspects U.S. officials of torturing and murdering his son. "He is very hurt. He trusted his son in this country to have a bright future that he otherwise wouldn't in his homeland," Shibly said.

A special FBI team is reviewing the fatal shooting of Ibragim Todashev, who was a friend of suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev and was under investigation for ties to a triple homicide in Massachusetts in 2011 that law enforcement officials say was drug related.

Officials from the FBI and the Department of Justice will examine the evidence in Todashev's death to determine "the reasonableness of the application of deadly force," the FBI said in a statement.

Todashev appeared on the FBI's radar soon after Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his brother, Dzhokhar, both Chechen immigrants, were identified as the Boston bombing suspects, and cellphone records connected the men.

Shibly said the FBI also was questioning Todashev about his and Tamerlan Tsarnaev's possible involvement in the unsolved 2011 triple homicide. Todashev's wife contends receipts for purchases place Todashev far from murder scene.

FCAIR hired a veteran homicide investigator to conduct an independent review of Todashev's killing. The investigator concluded that Todashev, a Chechen immigrant who was in the country legally, was shot seven times and received a major wound, possibly from a bullet, to the back of the head.

He also found blood splatter and other physical damage at the scene that suggested Todashev was shot while he was lying on the ground, Shibly said.

The FBI blocked the release of an autopsy report, which could help confirm the details of the shooting, he said.

Shibly said FCAIR's investigation uncovered disturbing information about FBI tactics used during interviews with Todashev's friends in the days leading up to his death.

Shibly said FBI agents "illegally threatened to throw them in jail and take away their green cards if they did not become informants and spy on several members of their faith, their mosques, their restaurants and so on."



headline: Obama speaks out against sexual assault during military base stop
byline: By Jeff Mason
8:31am EDT

U.S. President Barack Obama used a stop at a military base in California on Wednesday to speak out against sexual assault within the U.S. armed services.

Finishing a two-day trip to Arizona and California during which he promoted new housing reform proposals, Obama came to Camp Pendleton to thank military members for their service and warn Americans that al Qaeda was still a threat.

But his comments about sexual assault to roughly 3,000 Marines and Navy members highlighted another problem that has dogged in the military: high levels of sexual assault among the armed forces.

The Pentagon reported in May that there had been a 37 percent jump in cases of unwanted sexual contact in the military from 2011 to 2012, from gropings to rape. Sixty people have been removed from jobs as military recruiters, drill instructors and victims counselors as a result of screenings order following the report.

"I want you to hear it directly from me, the commander-in-chief," Obama said. "It undermines what this military stands for and it undermines what the Marine Corps stands for when sexual assault takes place within."

Debate over the military's sexual assault problem has been intense since a spate of high-profile cases.

Obama said it is critical to "stop these crimes of sexual assault and uphold the honor and the integrity that defines the finest military on earth."

8:31am EDT

A much anticipated report on the Connecticut school shooting that left 26 children and teachers dead last December will be available in the fall, state prosecutors said on Wednesday.

"We have said from the beginning while we want the report done as quickly as possible, we also want it done right," said Mark Ojakian, chief of staff for Governor Dannel Malloy. "Making sure the state's attorney's office has the independence it needs to do the job is critical, and we are trying to strike the right balance."

The report is expected to contain details including the shooter's possible motive. It has been repeatedly delayed and earlier this year Malloy scolded fellow politicians, who complained about the delays.

"There's no delay. There's never been a deadline or an actual target date set for the report to be issued," Mark Dupuis, a spokesman for the state's Division of Criminal Justice, said on Wednesday.

No specific date was given for release of the report.

The December 14 massacre by 20-year-old Adam Lanza was one of the worst shootings in U.S. history. Lanza also shot and killed his mother and killed himself after the school rampage.

The shooting sparked sweeping new anti-gun legislation in Connecticut and nearby states, and fueled the national debate over gun control.

old boy was dead and a woman believed to be his mother was missing after flash flooding in central Missouri that closed an Interstate highway on Wednesday and triggered some evacuations.

"It appears they were washed out of their vehicle when it was swept from a small tributary into a larger creek," said Sergeant Dan Crain, a spokesman for the Missouri State Highway Patrol in Rolla, adding that the vehicle had been found.

The identities of the boy and woman, presumed to be mother and son, were not released. Authorities said they had been swept off a county road in their car on Tuesday and a search for them was underway near Waynesville, Missouri.

Heavy periodic rain from late Monday through Wednesday morning caused major flooding in and near Waynesville, about 130 miles southwest of St. Louis, and evacuations of some homes and buildings.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency on Tuesday and on Wednesday he sent 50 military police from the Missouri National Guard to help residents and protect property in flooded areas.

Rains caused a rapid rise in the Gasconade River, flooding parts of Interstate 44 and led to parts of the highway being closed, according to the Missouri Department of Transportation.

minded incumbent and a challenger promising a more inclusive governing style.

Incumbent Mayor Mike McGinn, a bearded former Sierra Club executive, had roughly 27 percent of the vote, based on the ballots received so far in the August 6 mail-in primary. Ed Murray, the leader of state Senate Democrats who helped shepherd the passage of gay marriage legislation, had 30 percent.

The top two finishers in the primary will advance to a general election in November, and both Murray and McGinn were comfortably ahead of third-place candidate Peter Steinbrueck.

To be counted, ballots needed to be post-marked by election day, so final numbers could still change. As of Wednesday afternoon, 93,406 votes had been tallied.

McGinn, who faced speculation in the local press that he might not advance from the primary, greeted the preliminary result as a victory, saying: "They always seem to count me out until the votes are counted."

McGinn was elected four years ago on a progressive and environmentalist platform. He opposed replacing a rickety Seattle viaduct with a car-friendly tunnel, has moved to raise the cost of downtown street parking and makes a point of riding his bike to work.

Murray, a longtime state legislator who would be Seattle's first openly gay mayor, has portrayed himself as more willing than McGinn to work with the business community and other non-progressives. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"Murray is clearly reaching out to people who are perhaps a bit more conservative and made a point in his campaign to say he'll reach across the aisle," said Knute Berger, a Seattle-based columnist and political observer. "McGinn is much more in the progressive activist mode."

Coming in third place, out of nine candidates on the ballot, was former Seattle City Councilman Steinbrueck, a strong supporter of neighborhoods, with approximately 16 percent of the vote.

Finishing a close fourth was City Councilman Bruce Harrell, who made reforming the police department and empowering minorities his campaign issues. Harrell said he had not yet decided which candidate to endorse.

"One of the challenges with Murray is that I'm still not completely clear on his platform," Harrell said. "But I don't think McGinn should be our next mayor."



headline: Wrecking crew razes Cleveland house that held three women
byline: By Kim Palmer
8:31am EDT

Wrecking crews on Wednesday demolished a rundown Cleveland house where three young women were imprisoned and tortured by Ariel Castro for about a decade.

An aunt of Gina DeJesus, one of the three abducted and held captive by Castro, took the first swipe at the house shortly after 7 a.m. EDT, operating a hydraulic excavator with assistance as a crowd swarmed the site, snapping photographs and applauding.

DeJesus' mother, Nancy Ruiz, cheered as the huge arm on a heavy demolition truck ripped into the pink room where her daughter had been held and fed through a hole in the door, County Executive Ed FitzGerald told Reuters. Reporters had limited access to the site.

The longest-held captive, Michelle Knight, 32, arrived at the house with a bunch of yellow balloons and watched as the home of her tormentor was torn to the ground.

"Nobody was there for me when I was missing," said Knight, who is estranged from her family. "I want people out there to know, including mothers, that they can have strength, they can have hope, their child will come back."

The razing came less than a week after Castro, 53, was sentenced to life in prison without parole plus 1,000 years, for holding Knight, DeJesus and Amanda Berry captive in his home on Cleveland's west side. They were 14, 16 and 20 when they were abducted.

Rubble from the home was placed in dumpsters as church bells rang at nearby Immanuel Church.

"The girls heard these bells every Sunday. That's why (they are) ringing them," said Herman Wendel, 84, a lifelong member of the church.

The debris will be trucked to an undisclosed location, shredded and burned so that no one will take "souvenirs," as some people did from the home of famed Cleveland serial killer Anthony Sowell, said Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty. Vials of dirt collected from Sowell's house were sold on a website before the home was razed in 2011.

Castro signed over the deed to the three-story house to Cuyahoga County when he pleaded guilty to 937 charges, including aggravated murder, for causing Knight to miscarry by beating and starving her.

Berry, 27, DeJesus, 23, and Knight went missing from the west side of Cleveland between 2002 and 2004.

On May 6, they were rescued, along with Berry's 6-year-old daughter by Castro, after neighbors heard Berry's cries and helped her break through the house's front door.

Police found more than $22,000 in a basement washing machine. Authorities had planned to use it to pay for the demolition but the wrecking company donated its services. The cash was then offered to the three women, who turned it down, asking for it to "go back to the community," McGinty said.

He said the county has acquired the deeds to two dilapidated homes that neighbor the Castro house and will begin demolition on those properties soon.

One spectator taking photos was Lisy Gonzalez, 35, a hospital maintenance worker who grew up in the neighborhood. She said the former site of the house of horrors should be used to build a shelter for victims of domestic violence.

"It should be a safe house. Something different than it was," Gonzalez said.

area transit system over wages and healthcare benefits have reached a tentative contract settlement, averting a strike on Wednesday that would have halted service for nearly 200,000 bus riders.

Union representatives and management reached agreement on Tuesday night, shortly before 1,800 drivers and other workers had planned to walk off the job against the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit Agency, which serves Oakland and Berkeley and links those areas with downtown San Francisco.

California's third-largest public bus system serves 181,000 bus riders daily in two large counties - Alameda and Contra Costa - on the eastern side of San Francisco Bay.

The agreement came less than a week after Governor Jerry Brown intervened to block resumption of a separate strike in the region against commuter rail service threatened by unions representing workers at the Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, system.

Rank-and-file union members will vote on whether to ratify the new three-year contract later this month, union spokeswoman Sharon Cornu said.

"This was a long and often intense negotiation, and there are no winners or losers in its outcome," David Armijo, general manager of AC Transit, said in a statement announcing that a deal had been reached with the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 192.

"This agreement protects workers, helps riders, and keeps service running," Cornu said, saying the direct participation of five members of AC Transit's board of governors in the talks had helped achieve a deal in time to avert a walkout.

The union representing the agency's bus drivers, dispatchers, mechanics and clerical workers had set a strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. Wednesday after initially failing to reach an accord with management on wages, benefits and safety concerns.

After a lengthy bargaining session on Tuesday, the union and the AC Transit board agreed on a 9.5 percent wage increase over three years and annual flat-rate healthcare contributions by workers starting at $70, Cornu said.

Union workers initially asked for a wage hike totaling about 10 percent over three years, while the board was seeking 9 percent, transit agency spokesman Clarence Johnson said.

Union members began negotiations with the board in March, four months before the contract expired.

The East Bay bus system deal came soon after union employees of BART called off a strike deadline against the San Francisco-area's central rail system, which carries 400,000 passengers daily.

As federally mediated talks bogged down, the two unions representing 2,400 BART workers had submitted a notice of intent to go back on strike on Monday morning. A previous shutdown began on July 1 and was called off on July 5.

Brown stepped in on Sunday, appointing a three-member board to investigate the labor dispute in a move that precluded a walkout during the course of the seven-day inquiry.

The investigative panel was due to meet in Oakland on Wednesday to consider presentations from both sides.

martial.

Major Nidal Hasan, the U.S.-born Muslim who admits he killed 13 soldiers and wounded more than 30 others in November 2009, is acting as his own defense lawyer with a standby team on hand to ensure his case is handled properly.

"Should he decide he wants to fight the death penalty, we're ready to defend him today. However, since that does not appear to be the case, we request that we become truly standby counsel, that we not be ordered and forced by the court in assisting in achieving the goal of arriving at the death penalty," one of the lawyers, Lieutenant Colonel Kris Poppe, said on Wednesday.

Hasan, wearing green fatigues and a full beard, disputed the assertion by the standby lawyer, calling it a distortion. Military Judge Colonel Tara Osborn ended the court proceedings for the rest of the day to consider the lawyers' request to distance themselves from the case.

Poppe said he based his conclusion on documents that Hasan's civilian defense lawyer sent to Fox News, Hasan's questions for potential jurors during the jury selection process, and Hasan's opening statement on Tuesday, when he told the jury, "I was the shooter."

Hasan, who opened fire on unarmed soldiers days before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan, also told the jury he switched sides in what he called America's war on Islam, saying, "I was on the wrong side." He has previously said he was protecting fellow Muslims from imminent threat.

He spoke quietly from his wheelchair, taking off a green knit cap when the court was in session.

"REPUGNANT TO DEFENSE"

The standby defense team wants to avoid being forced by the court to help Hasan achieve the death penalty, calling such a goal "repugnant to defense counsel and contrary to what our professional obligations are."

Hasan was "encouraging or working toward the death penalty," Poppe told the judge.

Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down when shot by military police during the attack, called Poppe's conclusion "a twist of the facts."

Hasan became more animated while defending his position, periodically interrupting the judge.

"Colonel Poppe has made an assertion that is inaccurate. I feel compelled to object. It's inaccurate and I'd like to clarify that," Hasan said.

The judge asked Hasan to submit his arguments in writing, and when Hasan refused, saying he wanted to explain his position orally, she shut down the hearing so it could continue in private.

The exchange took place without the presence of the 13 military officers of the jury, comprising nine colonels, three lieutenant colonels and a major. Nine votes are needed for a conviction but a unanimous verdict of guilty is required for execution to be an option.

Hasan previously offered to plead guilty in return for being spared the death penalty, but Osborn rejected that request based on the military's policy against allowing such pleas in capital cases.

He faces 13 charges of premeditated murder and 32 charges of attempted premeditated murder. The dead were 12 active duty soldiers and a retired chief warrant officer who worked as a civilian employee at the base. The victims were unarmed, as is normal for military personnel on bases such as Fort Hood.

Prosecutors declined to bring terrorism charges against Hasan, saying it would prejudice the trial.

A review by a former FBI director found Hasan had exchanged emails with Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing. Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.

headline: Citing tight budgets, U.S. Navy decides to scrap fire-damaged sub
byline: By David Alexander

powered submarine damaged by an arsonist last year rather than repair it, saying the $700 million repair cost could not be justified in a time of tight budgets.

The decision to deactivate the USS Miami nuclear attack submarine, which had been scheduled for another decade of service, was the second example in as many days of the balancing act facing the Pentagon as it attempts to deal with effects of huge across-the-board budget cuts.

The department announced on Tuesday that it had found ways to trim $1 billion in planned spending, enabling it to reduce the unpaid leave it is forcing on some 650,000 civilian employees this fiscal year to six days from 11.

Rear Admiral Rick Breckenridge said the decision to deactivate the USS Miami, which involves removing the nuclear fuel and preparing the vessel to be taken apart, followed a reassessment that projected a jump in likely repair costs to about $700 million from the initial $500 million.

"I want to emphasize just the colossal nature of the repair required to restore Miami to service," he told reporters in a conference call, noting the job was four times the amount of any previous repair job. "We're talking about the whole forward front end of the ship gutted."

The $37 billion across-the-board budget cut imposed on the Pentagon in March kept the Navy from accomplishing as much work on the Miami this year as it expected, he said, and it would have taken $390 million in the next fiscal year starting on October 1 to repair the vessel.

"Miami casts a fairly large shadow over an already pressurized maintenance and repair effort," Breckenridge said. "We just don't have that money within the Navy without substantially affecting critical maintenance on other warships and submarines."

The Miami was ravaged while undergoing repairs at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, in May 2012 when a civilian painter used a bag of rags to ignite a fire because he wanted to leave work.

Breckenridge said the fire began during a shift change and as a result burned and spread for about 15 minutes before workers detected it. The fire burned for 12 hours as responders struggled to get into hard-to-access places to extinguish it. Four firefighters were injured.

Casey James Fury, 25, who was on medication for anxiety and depression at the time of the fire, pleaded guilty to setting the blaze and was sentenced this year to 17 years in prison.

Deactivating the submarine will take about nine months of preparation followed by another nine months of work at a cost of about $54 million. The work will be done at the Portsmouth Naval Yard, where it is still in dry dock, Breckenridge said.

The decision means cancellation of a substantial amount of work for General Dynamics Electric Boat, which was due to handle the repairs. Breckenridge said the Navy was "looking hard" at other projects that could be shifted to Electric Boat to offset the impact on the company's work force.

The Navy has 53 nuclear-powered attack submarines in its fleet plus four cruise missile submarines. It typically keeps 10 of the vessels forward-deployed around the world at all times, Breckenridge said.

Authorities searched on Tuesday for a man they suspected of setting fire to his Southern California home, killing a woman thought to be a close friend and abducting one or both of her children before trying to flee the state.

The remains of the woman and an unidentified child were discovered at the house, whose owner, 40-year-old James Lee DiMaggio, was believed to be headed for either Texas or Canada, authorities said.

Officials suspect DiMaggio in the slaying of Christina Anderson, 44, with whom he apparently had a "close, platonic relationship," the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.

The sheriff's statement also said DiMaggio is believed to have kidnapped one or both of Anderson's children - 16-year-old Hannah and 8-year-old Ethan.

Christina Anderson's body was discovered on Sunday night by firefighters sent to DiMaggio's home, the sheriff's department said in a statement. The house and a detached garage in the unincorporated desert community of Boulevard, east of San Diego near the Mexican border, were both found in flames.

Investigators determined that Anderson, a resident of the San Diego suburb of Lakeside, had been slain. They did not release details. The cause and manner of death for the child found in the rubble were not yet determined.

A dog also found killed in the same building, the sheriff's office said.

An Amber Alert child-abduction notice was issued for both Anderson children, but it was not immediately clear whether detectives believed one of them might have been the unidentified child found dead at the fire scene.

Authorities did not say whether they have any theories on a possible motive in the case.

laden Detroit, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month, according to election results Tuesday night.

With 98 percent of the city's precincts reporting, Mike Duggan, a former hospital chief executive waging a long-shot write-in campaign appears to have received more than half of the votes in a crowded field of 16 contenders.

More than half the votes counted have been for a write-in candidate. Election officials have not tallied the names on the write-in ballots but the vast majority are presumed to be for Duggan.

"This is the rarest of all campaigns," Duggan told a crowd of supporters. "This is the campaign where the volunteers motivated and inspired the candidate."

Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon was in second place, with 30 percent of the vote.

Unlike the Republican and Democratic primaries held to pick candidates for many local and national races, Detroit holds an open, non-partisan primary for mayor, with the two top vote-getters advancing to the general election.

The candidates will face off in a general election on November 5 to replace Mayor Dave Bing, who decided not to seek re-election after the city was put under the supervision of a state-appointed emergency manager in March.

Once the automotive center of the world, Detroit's economy and population has shrunk, and the city is saddled with an estimated $18 billion to $20 billion in debt. In March, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder appointed bankruptcy attorney Kevyn Orr as emergency manager. Orr is expected to serve for at least 18 months.

The ballot carried another write-in candidate with a similar name to the top vote-getter in Tuesday's election, Mike Dugeon, a barber whose entry into the race was seen as an attempt to spoil Duggan's efforts.

Other candidates in the field included four-time mayoral candidate and accountant Tom Barrow, former state representative Lisa Howze, state Representative Fred Durhal Jr., former Detroit corporation counsel Krystal Crittendon and state Representative John Olumba.



headline: Man charged with murder in car rampage on Venice Beach boardwalk
byline: By Dan Whitcomb and Dana Feldman
8:31am EDT

A man accused of plowing his car through crowds at the Venice Beach boardwalk in Los Angeles, killing an Italian woman on her honeymoon and injuring 16 other people, was charged on Tuesday with murder and multiple counts of assault with a deadly weapon.

Nathan Louis Campbell, who was also charged with 17 counts of felony hit-and-run, pleaded not guilty during a brief arraignment hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court, appearing pale and feeble in blue jail garb and shackles.

"He is quite distraught. He is very saddened that an individual has lost their life," Campbell's defense attorney, Philip Dube, told reporters outside court. "He does not believe that he is a homicidal person, he does not set out in life to injure or to harm people, and he is profoundly saddened by this."

Dube described his 38-year-old client as "fragile, frail and withdrawn" but said he did not believe he was mentally incompetent.

Prosecutors say Campbell was at the wheel of his dark blue 2008 Dodge Avenger as it sped down the packed ocean front walk in Venice Beach shortly before 6 p.m. on Saturday, striking and killing 32-year-old Italian tourist Alice Gruppioni.

Witnesses have said it appeared the driver was aiming for pedestrians along the boardwalk, a major Los Angeles tourist attraction known for its patchwork of street vendors, souvenir shops, restaurants and sporting areas in one of the city's quirkiest neighborhoods.

'GRIEF AND SORROW'

Security footage aired on ABC News shows the car smashing into a crowd of people, backing up and then driving into another throng. Police initially listed 11 people as wounded, but in charging Campbell, prosecutors said 16 people were struck by the car and suffered some form of injury.

Gruppioni, who was married two weeks ago, died of blunt force injuries to the head and neck, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office.

Her new husband, Christian Casadei, suffered less serious injuries and according to family members was returning to Italy with her body on Tuesday to make funeral arrangements.

"No words can adequately express the grief and sorrow we are feeling as we mourn the loss of a beautiful person, family member and young bride. Thank you all for your concerns as we begin to search for answers," the family said in a statement.

Campbell was taken into custody on Saturday after abandoning his car blocks from the scene and walking to a police station in the adjacent community of Santa Monica.

On Tuesday, Campbell was ordered held on $1.48 million bail by a judge who ordered him to return in September for a pre-trial hearing.

Authorities have disclosed little about what might have motivated the rampage at a top Southern California tourist spot. A Los Angeles Police Department spokesman has said that Campbell made incriminating statements to officers in Santa Monica.

Dube, a public defender, said his client was originally from Georgia but had lived in Colorado and California, working as a car mechanic, at restaurants and in the construction industry. He said Campbell's parents were deceased and that he had no siblings.

Some 100 people gathered on the boardwalk on Monday night in a moment of silence for Gruppioni and the injured.

A Los Angeles City Council member has asked fire and law enforcement agencies to study placing permanent concrete barricades in place to restrict vehicle access to the boardwalk.



headline: Obama 'disappointed' with Russia, calls embassy threat significant
byline: By Jeff Mason
8:31am EDT

U.S. President Barack Obama confirmed on Tuesday that he would go to Russia this fall for a G20 summit but said he was "disappointed" that Russia granted temporary asylum to former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Speaking on NBC's "The Tonight Show" with host Jay Leno, Obama said Moscow sometimes slipped into a Cold War mentality, despite being cooperative with the United States on some issues, including counterterrorism efforts in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing.

Obama was not asked and did not mention whether he would attend a separate meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his Russian trip. That meeting was put in question after Moscow rejected U.S. pleas and granted Snowden a year's asylum. The White House has said it is evaluating whether a one-on-one with Putin makes sense.

Washington wants Snowden, who was in hiding in Hong Kong before flying to Moscow in June, to be sent home to face criminal charges including espionage for disclosing secret American internet and telephone surveillance programs.

"There have been times where they slip back into Cold War thinking and a Cold War mentality," Obama said of Russia.

"What I say to President Putin is, that's the past and ... we've got to think about the future. And there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to cooperate more effectively than we do."

During the interview, Obama also said the recent threat that caused the United States to close its embassies throughout the Middle East was significant.

"It's significant enough that we're taking every precaution," Obama said.

"It's a reminder that for all the progress we've made ... this radical, violent extremism is still out there," Obama said. "We've got to stay on top of it."

The U.S. State Department issued a worldwide travel alert on Friday warning Americans that al Qaeda may be planning attacks in August, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. It initially announced the embassy closures would be only for Sunday, then extended the closures of some by a week.

Asked whether the controversial surveillance programs helped lead to the intelligence that sparked the warnings, Obama said the programs were critical to counterterrorism work. But he said more needed to be done to assure Americans they were not being spied on themselves.

"We don't have a domestic spying program," he said. "What we do have are some mechanisms where we can track a phone number or an email address that we know is connected to some sort of terrorist threat."

The odds of dying in a terrorist attack were less than dying in a car accident, Obama said, and Americans should be careful but did not need to cancel planned vacations to places such as Europe as a result of the recent travel warnings.

LIGHTER SIDE

In lighter notes, Obama said he had invited his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, to her recent lunch at the White House and described her as having a post-administration "glow."

"We have become genuinely close, and I could not have more respect for her," Obama said.

Asked by Leno whether the former first lady and potential 2016 presidential candidate had "measured the drapes" while she was there, Obama said no.

"Keep in mind she's been there before," he joked. "She doesn't have to measure them."

Obama also confirmed - more or less - a budding "bromance" with his former 2008 presidential rival, Republican Senator John McCain, who has been supportive of Obama's push to reform U.S. immigration laws.

"That's how a classic romantic comedy goes, right? Initially you're not getting along and then you keep on bumping into each other," Obama joked.

"John McCain and I have, you know, a number of philosophical differences, but he is a person of integrity. He is willing to say things regardless of the politics."

Leno also poked fun at Obama for having told a group of young people that broccoli was his favorite food.

"Me and broccoli, I don't know, we've got a thing going," Obama offered.



headline: Poll finds Americans want to live longer, but not too much

100 years? Maybe 120? Would extended life spans be good for society, the economy and the way people go through their lives?

With populations aging and medical science progressing, questions like these are moving from the science-fiction category to the realm of long-term issues that ethicists and policy makers are starting to consider.

The Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank known for its surveys into political and social trends, published a report on Tuesday exploring views about "radical life extension" and its effects in the United States.

Entitled "Living to 120 and Beyond", the report said that "many Americans do not look happily on the prospect of living much longer lives". Among the findings:

- The median ideal lifespan mentioned in the poll of 2,012 people was 90 years, about 11 years longer than the current average U.S. life expectancy of 78.7 years.

- Some 56 percent said they would refuse medical treatment to extend their lives, 38 percent would take it and the rest didn't answer. But 68 percent thought that other people would seize the opportunity. Only 41 percent thought living to 120 would be good for society.

- Some 79 percent said life extension should be available to all, but 66 percent thought only the rich would have access to it and another 66 percent feared scientists would offer the treatment before fully understanding its health effects.

- Black and Hispanic Americans are more positive than whites about extending life, although the survey could not explain why. Religious views, gender and education did not seem to play a significant role in responses to the national survey.

ENDLESS LIFE "NO PARADISE"

Pew's Forum on Religion and Public Life conducted the survey as part of its focus on emerging issues with religious and ethical implications, researcher Cary Funk told Reuters.

"Once we started talking to people whose job it is to think about ethical issues and the future, this came up over and over again," said her fellow researcher David Masci.

The report stressed medical science is not yet able to offer radical life extension treatment and noted that three-quarters of those polled did not think average people in 2050 would be able to live to 120 or longer.

Only 10 percent said having more elderly in the population would be bad for U.S. society, although 53 percent thought it would not make the economy more productive.

The report said extending life spans would challenge the concept of life-long marriage and could confuse relations within families when "people may not look or act much older than their parents, grandparent or even great grandparents."

It cited ethicists who asked whether postponing death until a distant future would make people appreciate life less.

While all faiths confront the issue of death, the report said none had yet taken a position on radical life extension.

But researcher Masci found that former Pope Benedict, who unexpectedly retired in February citing his old age, addressed the issue in a Holy Saturday sermon back in 2010.

Benedict, now 86, observed that modern medicine sought to delay death as much as possible and asked whether radical life extension would be a blessing.

"Humanity would become extraordinarily old, there would be no more room for youth," he said at the Vatican. "Capacity for innovation would die and endless life would be no paradise. If anything (it would be) a condemnation."



headline: U.S. military judge trims potential sentence in WikiLeaks case
byline: By Tom Ramstack
8:31am EDT

The military judge who last week convicted soldier Bradley Manning of committing the biggest breach of classified data in U.S. history through WikiLeaks on Tuesday trimmed the maximum prison sentence the private first class could face.

But the 25-year-old former intelligence analyst could still be spending the rest of his life behind bars after Judge Colonel Denise Lind ruled that he could face a maximum sentence of 90, rather than 136, years for turning over more than 700,000 battlefield videos, diplomatic cables and other secret documents to WikiLeaks.

Manning's attorneys had objected that the prosecution was overreaching in seeking separate sentences for all the espionage charges. His lawyers acknowledged he had downloaded files on different days, but said he grouped many of them into single files before transmitting them in 2010 to WikiLeaks, a pro-transparency website.

Lind, who convicted Manning of 19 criminal counts, ruled that some counts resulted from the same sequence of actions by Manning and should be merged to avoid "an unreasonable multiplication of charges."

For most of the espionage charges resulting from the transmissions, "there is no evidence of prosecutorial overreaching," Lind said.

The court-martial of the slightly built soldier, who was working as an analyst in Iraq when he released the documents to the anti-secrecy site, has drawn international scrutiny. The trove of documents he provided catapulted WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, into the spotlight.

The U.S. government contended that releasing classified information threatened national security.

Access to classified information remains a sensitive subject after Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence contractor, this summer revealed the super-secret National Security Agency program to collect phone and Internet records.

Manning, a low-level intelligence analyst described during the trial as an Internet expert, faces the prospect of decades of prison monotony without online access, likely at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

MISTREATMENT

The sentencing phase of Manning's court-martial began last week and is expected to last at least until Friday. Lind ruled during preliminary hearings that the sentence would be trimmed by 112 days because Manning was mistreated following his arrest in Iraq in May 2010.

Manning last week was found not guilty of the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, which carried the threat of life in prison without parole, and his lawyers have portrayed him as naive but well intentioned. They argue his aim was to provoke a broader debate on U.S. military policy, not to harm anyone.

In an interview on CNN, his father Brian Manning said he was "relieved" his son was not convicted of aiding the enemy but said: "It's upsetting and frightening that your son is being accused of these horrible breaches of security."

The elder Manning said he believed his son was innocent but that the two have not spoken in months, at his son's request.

"I still love my son," he said in the interview.

After Lind's ruling, two military officials - Major General Michael Nagata, the deputy chief for the Office of the Defense Representative to Pakistan from 2009 to 2011, and Air Force Colonel Julian Chesnutt, a U.S. military adviser at the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan from 2010 to 2012 - testified behind closed doors on the impact of the WikiLeaks releases on relations with Islamabad.

Lind also ruled she would not allow the prosecution's "aggravation evidence" to be considered in sentencing unless it could be shown to be "a direct and immediate result" of information he gave to WikiLeaks. Aggravation evidence refers to problems that worsened because of a criminal offense.

In a sign of the international furor the Manning case has generated, a play about the gay soldier won a newly created drama prize on Tuesday at Britain's oldest literary awards.



headline: Deal reached averting San Francisco-area bus strike
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

area transportation system over pay and healthcare benefits have reached a deal, averting a strike that would have affected nearly 200,000 commuters.

Union representatives and management reached agreement on Tuesday night, minutes before 1,800 transit workers planned to walk off the job. The agreement came less than a week after California Governor Jerry Brown intervened to halt a massive commuter rail worker walkout in the area.

"This was a long and often intense negotiation and there are no winners or losers in its outcome," David Armijo, general manager of the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit Agency, said in a statement.

"We are happy we were able to get through the process without any disruption in service," Armijo said.

The transit agency serves 181,000 bus riders daily in two large East Bay counties, in an area that includes Oakland and Berkeley, and downtown San Francisco.

The union representing the transit agency's bus drivers, mechanics and clerical workers gave a 72-hour strike notice on Monday, after failing to reach an agreement on wages, benefits and safety concerns with the agency's board of governors.

After a lengthy session on Tuesday, the union and the board agreed on a 9.5 percent wage increase over a three-year period and annual flat rate healthcare contributions starting at $70, said union spokeswoman Sharon Cornu in a statement.

Union workers initially asked for a wage hike totaling about 10 percent over three years, while the board offered 9 percent, transit agency spokesman Clarence Johnson said.

"This agreement protects workers, helps riders, and keeps service running," Cornu said.

Union members began negotiations with the board in March, four months before the contract expired.

The bus worker deal followed a narrowly avoided strike by employees of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District, the San Francisco-area's central rail system that carries 400,000 passengers daily.

After failing to negotiate new contract terms, the two unions representing 2,400 rail system workers on Thursday submitted a notice of intent to strike on Monday morning. But Brown stepped in late Sunday night and delayed a possible strike for seven days, appointing a three-member board to investigate the labor dispute.

A rail strike would be prohibited while the investigation is underway. The BART board of inquiry is scheduled to meet with BART unions and management on Wednesday.



headline: Traffic ticket spurs fight over state services in Hawaiian language
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

vehicle officials in his traditional tongue is using a traffic court case to push for the hiring of more Hawaiian speakers in government posts.

Daniel Anthony, 35, does not contest that he was speeding when he was pulled over on Oahu in January. But he says he was driving without a license only because his had lapsed five years earlier when multiple attempts to renew it by speaking to Department of Motor Vehicles officials in Hawaiian ended in blank stares and derisive laughter.

"You can't live in Hawaii without speaking Hawaiian. Our everyday language is littered with it," Anthony said. "But use it formally and you're shunned in our official community."

Anthony, who is next due to appear in court for the pending traffic case on August 28, argues in part that Hawaiian's status as an official language enshrined in the state constitution means that government agencies must be equipped to engage with Hawaiian-speaking residents.

His case is part of a multi-faceted movement to revitalize traditional Hawaiian language, culture and political power that has gained traction in recent years, said John Rosa, an assistant professor of history at the University of Hawaii who specializes in 20th century Hawaii.

While the state has two official languages, Rosa said, official business has long been conducted in English, with Hawaiian generally reserved for ceremonial occasions.

Anthony said encouraging state and local officials to hire Hawaiian speakers will make learning the language more appealing to young Hawaiians. Among the beneficiaries, he said, would be his own children, who attend Hawaiian-language charter schools.

"I truly believe that the work I am doing will make a stronger Hawaiian community in the future, will give value to the language they are trained in and will hopefully help them prosper," Anthony said.

Hawaii court records show that since 1997, Anthony has had 28 traffic court cases. He said that during the late 1990s he intentionally violated traffic laws so that he could go to court and demand to be heard in Hawaiian.

His most recent moving violation, he said, was not born of activism. But now that he is back in court, he said, he intends to press his case. A state Department of Transportation spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.

Hawaii State Judiciary spokeswoman Marsha Kitagawa said Anthony's request for an interpreter in his current case has been granted, but points to court records showing past instances where he has engaged the court in English.

Traffic court aside, this is not Anthony's first fight with Hawaiian officialdom. In 2009, he co-founded a company that uses traditional methods to make poi, a Hawaiian staple food made from mashing taro plant stems and mixing them with water.

When the Hawaii State Department of Health objected to his use of wood and stone to mash the plants as well as the traditional attire he wears in the kitchen, Anthony took his fight to the state legislature.

In 2011, Hawaiian lawmakers passed a law exempting poi makers from most state health regulations, provided they follow certain rules and include a warning label on their products.

8:31am EDT

U.S. daredevil Anthony Martin escaped Tuesday from a locked box dropped from an airplane at 14,500 feet after freeing himself from handcuffs and picking the lock in under a minute.

"I praise God it all went good," the 47-year-old an escape artist from Sheboygan, Wisconsin told reporters afterward in comments carried on the Website of Chicago television station WLS. "It's good to be here. It's good to be alive."

He was reprising a stunt he did 25 years ago that his closest associates considered one of his most dangerous.

In the stunt, Martin's hands were cuffed to a belt around his waist and his right arm was chained to the inside of the box. Locksmiths scrambled the box's lock so it could not be opened with a key.

Martin had about 40 seconds from the time he was launched into 120 mph free-fall to pick the lock, get out of the box, launch a parachute and land safely on the ground.

"I know what it's like being the guy in the box, but I don't know what it looks like on video. I can't wait to see," Martin told reporters.

A Skyvan twin-turbine plane took off from an airstrip near Ottawa, Illinois, southwest of Chicago and the box was dropped from a cargo bay over a field at Serena, about 5 miles away.

Two skydivers jumped along with Martin to stabilize the box, which was fitted with a parachute that provided stability but did not significantly slow the rate it fell. They were not equipped to open the box and rescue Martin if he failed.

Martin's longtime skydiving stunt coordinator, Rook Nelson, said before the feat he was confident the escape artist could complete the stunt but described it as highly dangerous.

Martin's personal website says he has escaped from handcuffs and manacles while skydiving, has been lowered under the ice in steel cages, gotten out of locked prison cells after being put in a straight jacket and escaped from a locked steel safe.

Making sure wages keep pace with record oil industry profits will be the top issue at the next round of contract negotiations between the leading U.S. oil refinery workers union and oil companies, a United Steelworkers official said on Tuesday.

Although the contract talks aren't set to start until January 2015, the union just completed the first conference of refinery workers to assess issues of concern to members, providing an early glimpse of the union's likely negotiating agenda.

The union says single-digit percent wage increases have paled in comparison with profits that have soared in the oil sector in recent years.

"I think the industry is at a time of earning record profits," said Gary Beevers, international vice president of the United Steelworkers union, which represents the majority of U.S. refinery workers. "They seem to be taking the position that the profits are theirs and they aren't going to share them."

A strike was narrowly averted during the last round of talks in 2012.

Workers at 69 of 142 U.S. refiners, equal to two-thirds of national crude oil refining capacity, are represented by the United Steelworkers.

"We're heading for a showdown," Beevers said of the negotiations still about 16 months away. "I think the next round of bargaining is going to the toughest we've ever engaged in."

In the past two rounds of talks with the oil industry, the USW pushed for tougher health and safety protections after deadly refinery explosions in 2005 and 2010 that claimed a total of 22 lives.

Before reaching agreement with lead oil company negotiator Shell Oil Co, the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (<span id="symbol_RDSa.L_0">RDSa.L</span>), in 2012, the USW had alerted more than 30,000 refinery workers to prepare for a strike. An agreement came hours before the three-year contract expired, unsettling oil markets.

Workers in 2012 won pay increases of 2.5 percent in the first year and 3 percent in each of the two succeeding years of the agreement. The company also agreed to follow a standard meant to prevent fatigue, and put union health and safety representatives in the refineries.

Average national pay is about $34 an hour for union refinery workers.

At least six percent of U.S. refining capacity would have been shut in the first days of a nationwide strike in 2012, based on company plans at that time. The last nationwide strike was in 1980 and lasted for three months.

Talks in 2009 with Shell were extended for three days to reach an agreement.

A Shell spokeswoman declined to discuss the 2015 round of negotiations.

"It is very early in the process and we cannot comment at this time," said Shell spokeswoman Destin Singleton.

In 2012, Royal Dutch Shell recorded profits of $27 billion. In the first two quarters of 2013, the company has reported a total of $10 billion in earnings.



headline: Tribal activists block Idaho highway over tar sands 'megaload'

ton load of equipment bound for the tar sands of Alberta, Canada.

The blockade by more than 250 mostly Native American protesters halted travel of a so-called megaload for two hours on a scenic roadway at the front lines of an ideological struggle over North American oil and gas development and its impact on the environment, local communities and native cultures.

The Nez Perce said they staged the protest to oppose the shipment of massive oil refinery equipment along wild stretches of two prized Idaho rivers, the Clearwater and the Lochsa, and through Nez Perce and protected federal lands.

The 19 Nez Perce activists who were arrested by tribal police on Tuesday were later released on bail, authorities said. The megaload resumed its journey after the protest.

Nez Perce Chairman Silas C. Whitman said in a statement that tribal leaders were against "the conversion of this wild and scenic area into a high and wide industrial corridor."

The load, which measures 255 feet long, 21 feet wide and 23 feet tall, is one of two planned shipments by an Oregon hauling company, Omega Morgan, of a water purification unit being trucked to Alberta production fields, according to an Idaho transportation permit issued on Friday.

The route along U.S. Highway 95 and U.S. 12 follows a historic trail broken by early Nez Perce bison hunters and used in the early 19th century by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on a government-sponsored expedition that charted the newly purchased American West.

Megaload opponents say the oversize trucks may impair the visual and ecological values of the trail and a river corridor that supports threatened steelhead and Chinook salmon and fuels a tourist economy tied to rafting, fishing, camping and hunting.

The Omega Morgan load, which will take four nights to cross Idaho into Montana, was approved by Idaho over the objections of environmentalists and despite U.S. Forest Service concerns.

"This is a quiet, winding mountain highway through a beautiful river canyon, not an industrial park," said Kevin Lewis, conservation director of Idaho Rivers United.

The Forest Service had sought to stop the shipment pending a study of its social, economic and ecological impacts.

Omega Morgan spokeswoman Olga Haley said an Idaho permit allowed the shipment to proceed but declined further comment. Clearwater County Commissioner Don Ebert supported the shipments.

"What are we going to stop next? We have to have commerce in this country," he said.



headline: Case of Boston mob boss 'Whitey' Bulger goes to jury
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

The jury in the trial of James "Whitey" Bulger concluded its first day of deliberations on Tuesday without a verdict on whether the former Boston mob boss is guilty of murder and racketeering charges that could put him in prison for the rest of his life.

The 12 jurors and six alternates were dismissed and were due back in court on Wednesday to continue sifting through testimony from a trial that has lasted almost two months.

They heard witnesses testify about the era when Bulger ruled Boston's underworld as head of the Winter Hill gang. The 83-year-old defendant is charged in connection with 19 murders the government says he committed or ordered in the 1970s and '80s.

A sweeping 32-count indictment also charges him with drug dealing, extortion and maintaining an arsenal of guns that prosecutors described as the "tools of the trade."

Bulger has pleaded not guilty to all charges, though his lawyers admitted on the first day of the trial that Bulger had been a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark.

U.S. District Judge Denise Casper reminded the jurors they could not consider Bulger's decision on Friday not to testify in his own defense at a trial he called "a sham."

"No inference of guilt or of anything else may be drawn form the fact that the defendant did not testify," said Casper.

Despite his decision not to testify, prosecutors worried that Bulger may try to get his story out through the media. After the jurors were dismissed, prosecutors complained to the judge that they had been told Bulger's attorney had been trying to set up a telephone interview between his client and CNN. Bulger's defense team denied that an interview had been planned with the cable news network.

Twice during the trial, the judge admonished an outspoken Bulger for cursing at witnesses who said he was an informant for the FBI, which ignored his crimes in return for tips about other criminal gangs. Bulger insisted he was not "a rat," but conceded that he did pay FBI agents to give him information.

The jury heard former gangsters, extortion victims and law enforcement officials recount the gory details of killings they said Bulger either ordered or carried out. The murders included innocent people gunned down in botched attempts to kill rivals and fellow criminals the gang killed because Bulger suspected they were talking to police.

Former mob lieutenant Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi testified that Bulger strangled two women, Flemmi's girlfriend and step-daughter, because the mob boss feared they knew too much.

For most of the trial, Bulger, who has lost the shock of light hair that earned him the nickname "Whitey" in his youth, sat quietly at the defense table, writing on a yellow legal notepad.

Bulger fled Boston in 1994 after a tip from a corrupt FBI agent that arrest was imminent. He lived in hiding for 16 years, many of them listed on the bureau's "Ten Most Wanted" list. Agents caught him living in a seaside Santa Monica, California, apartment in June 2011.

BLACK MARK ON FBI

During eight weeks of testimony at Boston's waterfront federal courthouse, not far from the location of some of the murders Bulger is accused of committing, defense attorneys conceded that he was "an organized criminal."

But they strongly disputed one claim of prosecutors that is not actually a crime. Defense attorneys insisted that Bulger had never served as an FBI informant.

Bulger's lead attorney, J.W. Carney, said during the trial that Bulger had paid corrupt FBI agent John Connolly for information on rival gangs but never provided any tips of his own.

Carney had intended to argue that Bulger could not be convicted due to an immunity agreement reached with a now-dead federal prosecutor, but Casper quashed that prior to the start of the trial. The judge noted that no immunity deal would allow an informant to commit murders.

Boston has long been fascinated by the story of how Bulger rose from a housing project to become the city's most feared gangster at the same time his brother, William, ascended in Massachusetts politics to became the powerful president of the State Senate.

Trading on his brother's influence, Bulger entered into a long relationship with a corrupt FBI agent, another Irish-American from South Boston. Prosecutors said the agent turned a blind eye to Bulger's crimes in exchange for information about the bureau's top national target, the Italian Mafia.

Jurors heard from dozens of witnesses including three top Bulger associates: Flemmi, John "The Executioner" Martorano and Kevin Weeks. Bulger's attorneys urged jurors not to trust these former mobsters, noting they had made plea deals to testify against their client in return for lenient sentences.

The three delivered gripping testimony, recounting stories of threatening extortion victims with machine guns; pulling teeth from the heads of murder victims to prevent police from identifying them; and burying bodies in shallow graves in the basement of a Boston home.

Jack Nicholson played a character inspired by Bulger in Martin Scorsese's 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed."

headline: San Diego mayor accused of inappropriate behavior by 11th woman
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

The number of women to publicly accuse San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of inappropriate behavior increased to 11 on Tuesday when a vocational nurse said she had been propositioned by Filner while seeking his help on behalf of a disabled U.S. war veteran.

The nurse, Michelle Tyler, told reporters that the mayor began stroking her arm and asking her out on a date while she was alone with him in his City Hall office in June - suggesting that his willingness to assist her depended on it.

The 70-year-old Democrat and former U.S. congressman has so far resisted mounting pressure to resign since his former press secretary filed a sexual harassment suit against the mayor and the city last month. He has instead entered intensive therapy.

Ten more women, including a retired U.S. Navy admiral and a college dean, have come forward in recent weeks to accuse Filner of groping them, making lewd comments or other unwanted sexual advances.

Filner has acknowledged a history of disrespectful, intimidating conduct toward women. On Sunday, he entered a clinic to undergo two weeks of behavioral counseling while taking a break from the daily routines of his office.

There was no immediate response from Filner's office to the latest allegations leveled against him.

Tyler said she visited Filner on June 11, accompanied by former Marine Katherine Ragazzino, who suffered a traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder from her service in Iraq.

They had gone to Filner's office asking him to intervene to help resolve administrative problems Ragazzino was having with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, for whom Tyler has worked.

According to Tyler's lawyer, Gloria Allred, Filner asked Raggazino to step out of his office, then turned to Tyler and told her, "You are really magnificent."

"He started rubbing her arm and told her, 'I will help your veteran,' and then he said, 'I want you to go out to dinner with me and spend time with me,'" Allred said of the encounter.

"I was not there looking for a date," Tyler told reporters. "I was only there looking for assistance for Katherine, an injured U.S. Marine in my care. I believe that a person in power should not take advantage of their position to gain a sexual advantage for themselves."

She added, "I felt that his rubbing my arm ... and making me feel that help for Katherine was contingent on going out with him was extremely inappropriate and unacceptable."

Allred, who also represents Filner's former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, said neither Tyler nor Raggazino was suing the mayor, but that she had filed a letter of complaint on Tyler's behalf with the city attorney.

The San Diego County Democratic Central Committee and numerous elected officials of both parties have called on the mayor to step down, and he is now the subject of a recall campaign to unseat him.

Filner, through his lawyer, had earlier asked the city to pay for his defense because he never received workplace behavior training. The city has filed its own lawsuit, seeking to recover any damages it might be ordered to pay as a result of Jackson's sexual harassment claim, along with court costs and attorneys fees.



headline: Cleveland house where three women were held set for demolition
byline: By Kim Palmer

Workers on Tuesday conducted a final inspection of the rundown Cleveland house where three young women were imprisoned and tortured for roughly a decade, in preparation for its demolition.

The razing, scheduled for Wednesday, comes less than a week after Ariel Castro was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 1,000 years, for holding Michelle Knight, Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry captive in his home on Cleveland's west side.

A steady stream of on-lookers drove by the house before Cleveland police blocked off the street to traffic.

County engineers cut off electricity to the house on Monday, ahead of the demolition. Castro's family members, including his son, Anthony Castro, went to the house, also on Monday, to retrieve personal items.

Ariel Castro, 53, signed the deed to the three-story house over to Cuyahoga County when he pleaded guilty to 937 charges, including aggravated murder for causing Knight to miscarry by beating and starving her.

Knight, 32, read a statement at Castro's sentencing, saying: "I spent 11 years of hell. Now your hell is just beginning."

Berry, 27, DeJesus, 23, and Knight went missing from the west side of Cleveland between 2002 and 2004.

They were rescued, along with Berry's 6-year-old-daughter by Castro, on May 6 after neighbors heard Berry's cries and helped her break through the house's front door.

Police found more than $22,000 in a washing machine in the basement. The money will help pay for the demolition.

Cleveland Councilman Brian Cummins, who represents the ward where the house is located, said his office is working on foreclosing on two adjacent, abandoned properties. Cummins said survivors and neighbors will help decide what to do with the properties.



headline: Man charged with murder in car rampage on Venice Beach boardwalk
byline: By Dan Whitcomb
8:31am EDT

A Colorado man accused of plowing his car through crowds at the Venice Beach boardwalk in Los Angeles, killing an Italian woman on her honeymoon and injuring 16 others, was charged on Tuesday with murder and multiple counts of assault with a deadly weapon.

Nathan Louis Campbell, 38, was also charged with 17 counts of hit-and-run, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a statement.

Prosecutors said Campbell was behind the wheel of a dark blue Dodge Avenger that sped down the packed boardwalk in Venice Beach shortly before 6 p.m. on Saturday, killing 32-year-old Italian tourist Alice Gruppioni.

Witnesses said it appeared the driver was aiming for pedestrians along the ocean front walk, a major tourist attraction known for its patchwork of street vendors, souvenir shops, restaurants and sporting areas in one of the city's quirkiest neighborhoods.

Security footage aired on ABC News shows the car smashing into a crowd of people, backing up and then driving into another throng. Police initially listed 11 people as wounded, but in charging Campbell, prosecutors said 16 people were struck by the car and suffered some form of injury.

Campbell, who police described as a transient with no strong ties to Southern California, was taken into custody after abandoning his car blocks from the scene and walking to a police station in the adjacent community of Santa Monica.

Authorities have disclosed little about what might have motivated the rampage at a top Southern California tourist spot. A Los Angeles Police Department spokesman has said that Campbell made incriminating statements to officers in Santa Monica.

Campbell was expected to be advised of the charges against him in an initial court appearance in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday, and prosecutors said they would seek to have him held on $1.48 million bail. He faces a possible life prison term if convicted.

Some 100 people gathered on the boardwalk on Monday night in a moment of silence for Gruppioni, who was traveling in California with her new husband, and for the other victims.

A Los Angeles City Council member has asked fire and law enforcement agencies to study placing permanent concrete barricades in place to restrict vehicle access to the boardwalk.



headline: Judge OKs vote on Alabama county's bankruptcy plan

largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy.

Creditors must vote by an October 7 deadline, as the official exit from the bankruptcy will pave the way to a year-end bond sale of about $1.9 billion that is needed to pay off current sewer debt bondholders at sizable discounts.

Eclipsed only by Detroit, when the city filed on July 18 for municipal bankruptcy with more than $18 billion in liabilities, Jefferson County had sought protection from creditors in November 2011, stung by overwhelming sewer debt and diminished revenues.

A large majority of Jefferson County's creditors have already agreed to the negotiated plan, which promises to deliver only $1.835 billion to sewer-system warrant holders owed $3.078 billion, with bondholder losses on a scale not seen since the 1930s. The county has also struck deals covering defaulted school warrants and other non-sewer debt.

On Tuesday, after hearing arguments by lawyers representing sewer-system customers that disclosures were inadequate, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas Bennett approved the massive disclosure plan and set the stage for votes by creditors. If approved by creditors, the plan must still be confirmed at a hearing expected to be held on November 12.

"Ballots go out before the end of this month," Kenneth Klee, the county's lead bankruptcy attorney, told reporters. "We will not know the final count until October."

Klee has repeatedly urged quick approval of the workout plan to pave the way to the bond sale, and he cautioned that rising interest rates might scuttle the planned refunding offering.

"If interest rates go past a certain point, the county and creditors will come back to the table, and the county will have to ask for concessions," Klee said.

Market fears that the Federal Reserve could soon unwind its expansionist monetary policy have pushed yields in the $3.7 trillion U.S. municipal bond market higher. The 30-year yield on top-rated bonds has risen by nearly 150 basis points since the start of the year, closing on Tuesday at 4.28 percent, according to Municipal Market Data.

David Carrington, president of the Jefferson County Commission and a negotiator during the bankruptcy talks, said Bennett's ruling was "another positive step toward the county's goal of exiting bankruptcy before the end of the year."

Bennett's approval will also allow work to begin on offering documents for the county's planned bond sales, according to Klee. Jefferson County is expected to pay unusually high interest rates that will weigh on the local government for decades.

laden Detroit, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month.

The candidates are due to face off in a general election on November 5 to replace Mayor Dave Bing, who decided not to seek reelection after the city was put under the supervision of a state-appointed emergency manager in March.

Once the automotive center of the world, Detroit's economy and population have shrunk, and the city is saddled with $18 billion to $20 billion in debt. In March, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder appointed bankruptcy attorney Kevyn Orr as emergency manager. Orr is expected to serve for at least 18 months.

The ballot carries two write-in candidates: Mike Duggan, a former hospital chief executive and long considered a front-runner; and Mike Dugeon, a barber whose entry into the race was seen as an attempt to spoil Duggan's efforts. Duggan had to wage a write-in effort because of a filing mishap.

Another top contender is Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon.

Other candidates with strong showings in polls include four-time mayoral candidate and accountant Tom Barrow, former state representative Lisa Howze, state representative Fred Durhal, former Detroit corporation counsel Krystal Crittendon and state representative John Olumba.



headline: FBI agents arrest two Florida mayors in graft probe
headline: Girls say vindicated by U.S. court win over 'Boobies' bands
byline: By Daniel Kelley
8:31am EDT

Two girls suspended from a U.S. school for refusing to remove "I (heart sign) Boobies!" bracelets supporting breast cancer awareness said on Tuesday they feel vindicated by a U.S. appeals court decision that says their free speech rights were violated.

"It's definitely exciting to know we did something important," said Brianna Hawk, who was an eighth grader at the eastern Pennsylvania public school when she took action that would lead to Monday's decision by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.

"We finally made a point that the bracelet isn't that bad," said Kayla Martinez, who was a seventh grader at the time at Easton Area Middle School.

The opinion began three years ago, when the girls started wearing the bracelets stating "I (heart sign) Boobies! (KEEP A BREAST)." The bracelets came from an organization that wanted to open a dialog about body image and breast cancer.

School administrators, however, worried that the bracelets were an unneeded invitation to middle school boys to make lewd comments and banned them.

A battle over the bracelets made it all the way to the full appeals court, which ruled the school district cannot ban them, citing their right to free speech.

Lawyers for the school district did not return calls and emails for comment.

The school district, joined by the Pennsylvania Association of School Boards argued that allowing the bracelets would open the door to a parade of other, more vulgar slogans with seemingly political or social statements. They said these included a t-shirt that reads "Save the ta-tas" (another breast cancer group), an advertisement for testicular cancer research that reads "balls" and one for human Papillomaviruses that says "I (heart sign) va jay jays," according to court papers filed by the association.

The court found that helping students navigate these questions falls within the school's duty to train them as citizens.

"Schools cannot avoid teaching citizens-in-training how to appropriately navigate the 'marketplace of ideas.' Just because letting in one idea might invite even more difficult judgment calls about other ideas cannot justify suppressing speech of genuine social value," the court said.



headline: Despite Snowden fracas, U.S. to hold high-level Russia talks Friday
byline: By Phil Stewart
8:31am EDT

The United States will hold talks with Russia's defense and foreign ministers in Washington on Friday despite Moscow's decision to grant asylum to former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.

The State Department, confirming a report by Reuters, said the talks would go ahead and that Snowden's case would be among the issues raised when Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel meet their Russian counterparts.

"We have raised Mr. Snowden with Russian officials many times in recent weeks. We expect to do so again," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.

"We would like to see Mr. Snowden return to the United States. I don't know technically what that requires, but we know they have the capability to do that."

Snowden had spent more than five weeks in a Moscow airport while trying to find a country to take him in. The United States wanted him returned to face charges for leaking National Security Agency surveillance secrets to the media.

Moscow's rejection of U.S. pleas to hand him over and grant him a year's asylum on Thursday has prompted President Barack Obama to rethink whether to hold a summit in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin next month.

Snowden's asylum in Russia also had put into doubt this week's "two-plus-two" talks between the Russian and U.S. officials.

The United States appears to be trying to avoid derailing ties with its former Cold War rival by proceeding with some high-level talks with Russia while still leaving Obama's participation in the summit in doubt.

SOLUTIONS IN SYRIA

Worsened ties between the United States and Russia could make it even more difficult for the two nations to arrange any kind of political solution in Syria, for example.

Moscow has supported President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war even as Obama has led international calls for him to step aside. Psaki said Syria would be part of the conversation.

"We certainly have our share of disagreements with Russia over a number of issues. And I'm sure they will be part of the conversation, as well," Psaki said.

She added that Iran's nuclear program would also come up.

There are concerns in Washington that, given deepening tensions, Russia may break ranks with Western countries seeking to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions through tough sanctions.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov criticized perceived U.S. wobbling on the need for top-level contact between the two countries.

"The U.S. administration questions further bilateral contact at the highest level (due to the situation with Snowden)," Ryabkov was quoted as saying by Interfax. "It seems to me that this is an utter distortion of reality. This is viewing the world through a distorted lens."

Ryabkov said Russia did not understand why the situation with Snowden was "being so blown out of proportion in the United States."

Snowden's father, Lon, plans to go to Moscow soon.

"We do not have a set date yet but we have been working closely with Anatoly Kucherena, Ed Snowden's attorney, on setting a definitive date which will be sometime in August," said Mattie Fein, a representative for Lon Snowden.



headline: Defiant Hasan tells Fort Hood trial 'I am the shooter'
byline: By Lisa Maria Garza
8:31am EDT

Nidal Hasan, a former U.S. army psychiatrist accused of murdering 13 fellow soldiers and wounding dozens more in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood four years ago, told a court on Tuesday that the evidence would clearly show "I am the shooter."

Hasan, who is confined to a wheelchair after being shot by military police during the attack, is representing himself in the trial at the Texas army base.

In a brief opening statement on the first day of the trial, he said witnesses would testify that "war is an ugly thing," with death and devastation on both sides.

"Evidence from this trial will only show one side. I was on the wrong side but I switched sides," Hasan, an American-born Muslim, said in a roughly two minute-long opening statement.

Hasan, 42, who carried out the shooting on November 5, 2009, just days before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan, has said he shot the soldiers to try to stop what he has called a U.S. war on Islam. Thirty-two people were wounded in the attack and some of them are expected to testify.

"Evidence will show that Hasan didn't want to deploy and he possessed a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible," military prosecutor Colonel Steve Henricks said in laying out the case. Some Muslims define jihad as a holy war.

Hasan could be sentenced to death if convicted. The military judge for the court-martial, Colonel Tara Osborn, has rejected Hasan's offer to plead guilty in return for being spared the death penalty.

An Army psychiatrist at Fort Hood at the time of the shooting, Hasan has since apologized for being in the U.S. military and helping the U.S. response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. He has tried to renounce his U.S. citizenship.

Hasan spoke very little during the opening statements and as testimony was heard from eight witnesses during the first morning session of the trial on the sprawling military base between Dallas and Austin, Texas.

He asked questions of two witnesses - his Army psychiatrist supervisor, and a man who accompanied him to Muslim services at a mosque two or three times a week.

Hasan had been rated on his performance appraisal, "Outstanding performance, must promote," said supervisor Ben Phillips, adding that everyone got that rating.

"I checked off that as I do with every officer because if you check any other, you basically end that officer's career," Phillips said.

Pat Sonti testified that on the morning of the shooting he accompanied Hasan to prayers at a mosque. Hasan took over the microphone to lead the call to prayer at the mosque even though it was Sonti's turn.

Hasan asked Sonti if there was a protocol for determining who leads prayer and Sonti said the Imam signals the chosen person. Hasan was not chosen but did it anyway, Sonti said.

Three of the witnesses were from a gun store near the base, where Hasan bought the pistol used in the shooting. Store manager David Cheadle said he showed Hasan how to assemble the pistol while Hasan recorded him on video.

Frederick Brannen, a former sales clerk at the store, testified that he sold Hasan the gun.

When the weapon was presented as evidence, Hasan said: "Your honor, that is my weapon."

A review by a former FBI director found Hasan had exchanged emails with Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing. Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike.

Judge Osborn ruled on Friday that prosecutors may present evidence that Hasan was on the Internet in the days, and even hours, before the attack, searching terms such as "Taliban" and "jihad."

Hasan has said he plans to call only two witnesses at trial, according to Fort Hood officials. The witnesses were not identified. Hasan may cross-examine any witness, including survivors of the attack.

He faces 13 charges of premeditated murder and 32 charges of attempted premeditated murder. The dead included 12 active duty soldiers and a retired chief warrant officer who worked as a civilian employee at the base.

The jury of 13 Army officers includes nine colonels, three lieutenant colonels and a major.

The trial had been delayed repeatedly over procedural issues, such as whether he would be allowed to keep a beard that violates military grooming regulations, which he has said he wears for religious reasons.

Hasan had sought to use a "defense of others" strategy at trial, arguing that his actions were taken to protect Muslims and the Taliban in Afghanistan from U.S. assaults. Osborn denied that request.

A unanimous verdict of guilty is required for execution to be an option. The last execution carried out by the U.S. military was in 1961.

Witnesses scheduled for the afternoon include a soldier who was shot by Hasan and survived.

Authorities searched on Tuesday for a man they suspected of setting fire to his Southern California home, killing a woman thought to be a close friend and abducting one or both of her children before trying to flee the state.

The remains of the woman and an unidentified child were discovered at the house, whose owner, 40-year-old James Lee DiMaggio, was believed to be headed for either Texas or Canada, authorities said.

Officials suspect DiMaggio in the slaying of Christina Anderson, 44, with whom he apparently had a "close, platonic relationship," the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.

The sheriff's statement also said DiMaggio is believed to have kidnapped one or both of Anderson's children - 16-year-old Hannah and 8-year-old Ethan.

Christina Anderson's body was discovered on Sunday night by firefighters sent to DiMaggio's home, the sheriff's department said in a statement. The house and a detached garage in the unincorporated desert community of Boulevard, east of San Diego near the Mexican border, were both found in flames.

Investigators determined that Anderson, a resident of the San Diego suburb of Lakeside, had been slain. They did not release details. The cause and manner of death for the child found in the rubble were not yet determined.

A dog also found killed in the same building, the sheriff's office said.

An Amber Alert child-abduction notice was issued for both Anderson children, but it was not immediately clear whether detectives believed one of them might have been the unidentified child found dead at the fire scene.

Authorities did not say whether they have any theories on a possible motive in the case.

headline: George W. Bush receives stent for blocked heart artery
byline: By Marice Richter
8:31am EDT

Former President George W. Bush underwent successful surgery at a Dallas hospital on Tuesday to place a stent in a blocked heart artery.

Doctors discovered a blockage on Monday during Bush's annual physical at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas and recommended a stent, a wire mesh coil used to prop open arteries, a Bush spokesman said.

The former president, 67, underwent surgery on Tuesday morning at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and was "in high spirits, eager to return home tomorrow and resume his normal schedule on Thursday," spokesman Freddy Ford said in a statement.

Bush never experienced any symptoms, and the blockage was detected because his physical included a stress test and electrocardiogram, according to an aide who asked not to be identified. Those results prompted a computerized tomography angiogram, which led to the discovery of the blockage, the aide said.

Bush exercised regularly during his two terms in the White House, from 2001 to 2009, preferring to run before knee pain led him to do more bicycling.

Since leaving office, Bush has kept up his exercise regimen, regularly riding his mountain bike, golfing and working out almost daily in a home gymnasium, the aide said.

"I love exercise," Bush said in a video for Physical Fitness Month in 2007.

He has been active in recent months, dedicating his presidential library and traveling to Africa. Bush has also become an avid painter.

Several factors besides fitness influence a person's risk of heart disease, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, stress and family history, according to the American Heart Association.

Typically, the procedure Bush underwent involves inserting a narrow, balloon-tipped tube with the stent through a puncture in the arm or thigh and snaking it through the vascular system and into the heart.

The procedure takes about 45 minutes to an hour, and most patients go home six to eight hours after a simple case, said Dr. Annapoorna Kini, director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at The Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York who was not involved in treating Bush.

The procedure is performed about 850,000 times a year in the United States, said Samin Sharma, another doctor at Mount Sinai.

Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, 89, served as president from 1989 to 1993. The elder Bush spent seven weeks in a Houston hospital for bronchitis and related ailments before his release on January 14. He usually makes public appearances in a wheelchair.

The younger Bush's presidency was shaped by the attacks of September 11, 2001. He left office in January 2009 with low public approval ratings due to the U.S. financial crisis that erupted near the end of his second term and the unpopular war in Iraq.

But a Gallup poll in June showed 49 percent of respondents viewed him favorably versus 46 percent unfavorably - the first time since 2005 that opinions of him were more positive than negative.

headline: Retailers cash in as students get picky about dorm rooms
byline: By Atossa Araxia Abrahamian

school season.

Dozens of retailers, from Target Corp and Williams-Sonoma Inc's Pottery Barn to boutique website Dormify.com, are marketing aggressively to the college crowd this year.

Using oversized catalogs, social media and temporary stores set up near colleges, they are offering everything for the picture-perfect dorm room, including monogrammed towels, state-of-the art storage containers and color-coordinated curtains and pillows.

"There are fewer products purchased, but when shoppers do buy things, they want them to be a bit better in quality," says NPD home industry analyst Debra Mednick. As a result, retailers are emphasizing slightly pricier items, she adds.

Retailers need to be aggressive because competition is tough and families plan to spend less than last year on school supplies overall.

The National Retail Federation expects back-to-college spending to average $836.83, down from about $900 last year. But dorm rooms were a bright spot in the group's study earlier this summer: Almost half of families plan to spend $104.76 on them, up from $100.27 last year and $96.84 in 2011.

The NRF does not break shopping down by gender, but retailers say decorating is a girls' market, with mothers of boys often taking an interest.

HOME AWAY FROM HOME

Students are becoming fussier about their dorms, and affluent "helicopter" parents, who have spent years deeply involved in their children's lives, want to ensure that the rooms are comfortable, or at least do not resemble a scene from the cult college movie "Animal House."

"Before, the mindset was, â&euro;&tilde;What's the bare minimum I need to get by?'" says Jeff Gawronski, founder of online dorm goods retailer Dormco.com. "Now it's, 'Do I want the 300- or 400-thread count cotton sheets? Do I want a nice extra-thick mattress pad?'"

Popular TV shows about home decorating, like "MTV Cribs" and "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition," are motivating many students to design their own projects for dorms, Gawronski says.

Dormco has benefited from these trends. Gawronski says he expects sales of about $4 million in 2013, up from $800,000 in 2010.

And industry experts say dorm dĂŠcor is becoming a new medium for self-expression as students flock to image-oriented social networking sites to show off their furnishings.

"For my generation, all parts of our life are online, so dorms are not only visible to our hall mates, but they're also on display to our greater social network," says Amanda Zuckerman, Dormify's 22-year-old co-founder.

EXTRA-LONG SHEETS

The cornerstone of dorm retail is known as the "bed in a box," a package of twin sheets, comforters and pillowcases made to fit the long, narrow beds in U.S. dorms. Traditionally sold through mail-order catalogs, the sets were typically simple, inexpensive and not intended to last beyond college.

Today, similar products are available from designers like Lilly Pulitzer, whose twin-XL floral-print comforter covers retail at $128, and Jonathan Adler, who teamed up with J.C. Penney Co Inc to make bedding sets that sell for around $140.

Stores are making one-stop shopping easy by creating exhaustive dorm checklists and building separate college-focused websites to show off their products. Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond Inc and other retailers also hold special sales for students in some locations, and Walmart says it sells university-branded products tailored to local stores near college campuses.

In mid-July, Target ran an online publicity stunt called Bullseye University, a pop-up dorm-in-a-box installation in Los Angeles with a live webcam that captured college-age YouTube celebrities living there 24 hours a day.

On a recent morning, remote viewers watched as Jenn Im, a college student who runs YouTube fashion channel Clothes Encounters, chatted with a friend in the makeshift room. Almost everything in it - curtains, baubles, a mirror, and chairs - was available on Target.com.

Dormify and Dormco also rely heavily on social media to reach shoppers during the critical summer months. Pinterest, for example, is wildly popular among college-aged girls and their mothers, prompting the retailers to make virtual "pinboards" to give visitors decorating ideas.

Even colleges are helping. Some, like the University of Washington, have Pinterest boards displaying furnishings in a typical room.

The University of Ohio has room dimensions and virtual tours on its website, said Housing Director Pete Trentacoste.

"We get a lot of questions about individual rooms from freshmen," he said. "There's a lot more festivity behind move-in day, and people are much more involved than they used to be."



headline: U.S. appeals court reinstates poker conviction
byline: By Nate Raymond
8:31am EDT

gambling law, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.

The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed a decision last year that said Lawrence DiCristina could not be prosecuted because "Texas Hold 'Em" was a game of skill rather than chance.

At the center of the case is the Illegal Gambling Business Act, a federal law enacted in 1970 to combat organized crime. The law makes it illegal to run a gambling business that violates a state's laws and either earns more than $2,000 a day or remains in operation for more than 30 days.

DiCristina was convicted under the law for running games of "Texas Hold 'Em" at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York, which he publicized by text message and word of mouth.

In August 2012, U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein in Brooklyn set aside the verdict, saying the statute was ambiguous as to what gambling it covered and that "Texas Hold 'Em" - as a game of skill - was not covered by the anti-gambling law.

But in its ruling Tuesday, the 2nd Circuit disagreed with Weinstein's finding that the statute was ambiguous.

"Because we find no such ambiguity, we decline to limit the statute's reach beyond its plain terms," U.S. Circuit Judge Chester Straub wrote for a three-judge panel.

The 2nd Circuit sent the case back to Weinstein to schedule sentencing. DiCristina faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

The latest ruling is a potential setback for supporters of legalizing online gambling in the United States.

A poker advocacy group called the Poker Players Alliance, which wrote one of several friend-of-the-court briefs backing DiCristina, called Tuesday's ruling "unfortunate."

The advocacy group noted that the ruling did not dispute that poker was a game of skill and said it remained committed to pushing for a federal definition of gambling as a game predominated by chance.

Neal Katyal, a lawyer for DiCristina at the law firm Hogan Lovells, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch did not respond to requests for comment.



headline: NYC comptroller candidate arrested for illegal drug sales

8:31am EDT

A former Manhattan madam who is running for New York City comptroller was arrested and charged with selling prescription pills for cash, the FBI said on Tuesday.

In the latest twist to the city's scandal-hit campaign season, Kristin Davis, 38, allegedly sold prescription pills to a federal informant four times in four months this year, the FBI said.

Davis is running for the post of comptroller - in effect the city's chief financial officer - also being sought by former Democratic New York Governor Eliot Spitzer.

Spitzer is attempting a political comeback after resigning as governor in 2008 amid a prostitution scandal. Davis has said Spitzer was one of her customers and that she provided him with prostitutes.

Polls show Spitzer tied with Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer in the Democratic primary, set for September 10.

Davis is charged with four counts of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, said George Venizelos, head of the FBI's New York office.

Following a federal court appearance on Tuesday afternoon, Davis was released on a $100,000 bond and ordered to surrender her passport and restrict her travel.

In court, she sat hunched over at the defense table, her hair in a ponytail, wearing a black sweater and slacks.

Her attorney Daniel Hochheiser said if Davis is indicted she will plead not guilty.

"Miss Davis is accused in a hearsay complaint based upon an unsworn statement of an admitted drug dealer seeking leniency at the expense of a high-profile target," he said following the bail hearing.

Davis spent four months in jail for her role in the prostitution scandal. Spitzer, 54, was never charged with any crimes.

Leaving the courthouse, Davis walked through a throng of reporters and cameras, declining to answer questions about how the charges could affect her candidacy, and hailed a taxi cab.

A Libertarian, she entered the race before Spitzer announced his candidacy.

Spitzer is not the only New York politician attempting this year to recover from scandal.

Anthony Weiner, who resigned from Congress in 2011 after saying he had accidentally sent a lewd picture of himself over Twitter, in May launched a campaign for mayor.

Last week he publicly defied calls by major newspapers to drop out after a website published racy text messages he sent subsequent to the earlier scandal.

laden Detroit, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month.

The candidates are due to face off in a general election on November 5 to replace Mayor Dave Bing, who decided not to seek reelection after the city was put under the supervision of a state-appointed emergency manager in March.

Once the automotive center of the world, Detroit's economy and population have shrunk, and the city is saddled with $18 billion to $20 billion in debt. In March, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder appointed bankruptcy attorney Kevyn Orr as emergency manager. Orr is expected to serve for at least 18 months.

The ballot carries two write-in candidates: Mike Duggan, a former hospital chief executive and long considered a front-runner; and Mike Dugeon, a barber whose entry into the race was seen as an attempt to spoil Duggan's efforts. Duggan had to wage a write-in effort because of a filing mishap.

Another top contender is Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon.

Other candidates with strong showings in polls include four-time mayoral candidate and accountant Tom Barrow, former state representative Lisa Howze, state representative Fred Durhal, former Detroit corporation counsel Krystal Crittendon and state representative John Olumba.



headline: Second major transit agency strike threatened in San Francisco area
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

area transit agency threatened on Monday to strike over pay and conditions, less than 24 hours after California's governor intervened to avert a massive commuter rail strike in the area.

The union representing 1,800 drivers, mechanics and clerical workers threatened to walk off the job on Wednesday over wage, healthcare cost and safety issues, Alameda-Contra Costa Transit spokesman Clarence Johnson said.

The transit agency serves 181,000 bus riders daily in two large East Bay counties, which include the cities of Oakland and Berkeley, and downtown San Francisco.

Members of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 192, the union representing the workers, asked for a 10.25 percent wage increase over three years, Johnson said.

Management offered a 9 percent increase over the same period and requested that members pay 10 percent of their healthcare premiums, Johnson said. Members currently do not pay a premium, he said.

"It's pretty cut and dry. It's a matter of money," Johnson said.

Union spokeswoman Sharon Cornu said the strike threat was about health and safety concerns and not just about money.

"Substantial health and safety issues, including meal and rest periods, and fundamental human rights are at stake," union President Yvonne Williams said in a statement.

The threatened bus strike follows a narrowly avoided strike by employees of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, the Bay Area's central rail system that carries 400,000 passengers daily.

After failing to negotiate new contract terms, the two unions representing 2,400 rail system workers on Thursday submitted a three-day notice of intent to strike.

Governor Jerry Brown stepped in last minute on Sunday night and delayed a possible strike for seven days, appointing a three-member board to investigate the strike. A rail strike would be prohibited while the investigation is underway.

Contracts for both groups of transit workers expired on July 1.

A zoning official and two local residents were shot dead when a man losing his condemned home in rural Pennsylvania shot his way into a town hall meeting, authorities said on Tuesday.

Rockne Newell, 59, targeted those he blamed for losing his property, which was condemned in a dispute over sewage, said Monroe County District Attorney E. David Christine, Jr.

Killed in Monday night's assault on the monthly meeting of the Ross Township board of supervisors were zoning officer David Fleetwood, 62, and James LaGuardia, 64, and Gerard Kozic, 53, residents of Saylorsburg who were awaiting their turn to conduct business before the board, Monroe County Coroner Robert Allen said.

Court documents showed that Newell has been sparring with local officials for more than 17 years over the Ross Township property and property in nearby Hamilton Township. Both are small towns about 90 miles north of Philadelphia.

Eighteen council officials and residents were at the meeting at Ross Township municipal building when the shooting occurred, police said.

The Pocono Record newspaper, which said one of its reporters had witnessed the shooting, reported that the shots had been fired through a wall and into the meeting.

"I saw smoke and plaster flying out, blowing out through the walls," reporter Chris Reber wrote in a firsthand account of the shooting. The noise was "like a string of firecrackers."

Police said Newell may have been shot in the leg, but they were unable to confirm his condition.



headline: L.A.'s Venice Beach community mourns after deadly car rampage
byline: By Dan Whitcomb
8:31am EDT

The seaside community of Venice Beach on Monday mourned an Italian woman who was killed there on her honeymoon and 11 other people who were injured when a man plowed a car through a crowd of weekend revelers at the boardwalk.

Police said they arrested Nathan Campbell, 38, a transient with no strong ties to Southern California, late Saturday and booked him on suspicion of murder. He could face formal charges as early as Tuesday.

Police said he abandoned the car blocks from the scene of the carnage and walked to a police station in the adjacent community of Santa Monica.

Witnesses have said it appeared the driver had been aiming for pedestrians on Saturday when he steered down the popular oceanfront walkway in Venice at speeds up to 20 miles per hour while people screamed and ran.

Security camera footage aired on ABC News showed the driver of the dark-colored Dodge Avenger parking across from a cafe and getting out. In the video, he scans the area, then gets in the car and drives into the throng before backing up and driving toward another group of people.

Police have said little about what might have motivated the rampage at a top Southern California tourist destination, but Los Angeles Police spokesman Andrew Neiman said that Campbell made incriminating statements to officers in Santa Monica.

"Sometime later after he drove away he did turn himself into the Santa Monica Police Department. That's where we caught up with him," Neiman said. "He said something that prompted Santa Monica officers to contact us, and we responded."

Neiman declined to elaborate on Campbell's statements or other evidence while the investigation was underway.

He said Campbell, who was being held on $1 million bail, did not have long-term ties to Venice Beach or the Los Angeles area, describing him as a transient who has previously lived in Colorado.

VIGIL FOR NEWLYWED

At the boardwalk, a patchwork of street vendors, souvenir shops, restaurants and sporting areas in one of the city's quirkiest neighborhoods, flowers and cards were left at the scene where 32-year-old Alice Gruppioni was killed and 11 others injured.

Police identified Gruppioni as a tourist from Italy who was spending her honeymoon in California. Stunned and dismayed employees of the nearby Candle Cafe &amp; Grill organized a vigil to remember Gruppioni and the injured.

About 100 people attended, passing around a large bouquet of flowers in pinks, reds and yellows. Even as the regular hubbub of the boardwalk continued around them, participants observed a moment of silence.

"One of our vendors and one of our regular guests got injured," said Dennis Walker, general manager of the Candle Cafe &amp; Grill. "I have two servers working this morning who have been here 19 and 12 years respectively. This is a very close-knit community."

Walker said security cameras from the restaurant captured part of the incident and, in his mind, made it clear that the driver drove into crowds on the boardwalk "meticulously and intentionally."

Meanwhile a Los Angeles City Council member, Mike Bonin, said he would seek to have barricades put in place to restrict car access to the boardwalk.

"While most of the streets that run into Ocean Front Walk are unimpeded, the site of last night's horrible tragedy actually had four bollards blocking the street, but apparently the assailant sped right around them, over the sidewalk and into the crowd," Bonin said in a Facebook post.



headline: Fire fears trigger U.S. Rocky Mountain ban on exploding shooting targets
byline: By Keith Coffman
8:31am EDT

parched national forests and grasslands in five states on Monday, after authorities blamed the devices for sparking 16 wildfires since last year.

The so-called "binary exploding targets," popular among firearms enthusiasts who use them for target practice, are made of canisters containing two chemicals that blend and explode when struck by a bullet.

The targets have become too risky to allow on tinder-dry national lands in the Rocky Mountains region that have been in the grips of a multi-year drought, authorities said.

"When detonated, the exploding targets often result in a fireball that can ignite vegetation and surrounding materials," according to a joint statement by the forest service and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Denver.

The current fire season has been particularly deadly in the U.S. West, with at least 22 fatalities reported since June, among them two people caught in a Colorado fire and 19 firefighters in Arizona. None of the fatal fires were caused by exploding targets.

The crackdown on the targets covers the 17 national forests and seven grasslands the forest service manages in its Rocky Mountain region which includes Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota.

The U.S. Forest Service has blamed the targets for lighting 16 wildfires since 2012, seven of them in the five-state region under the ban. The blazes together cost more than $33 million to put out.

In conjunction with its regional offices, the forest service is "developing a national approach" to deal with the issue, spokesman Larry Chambers said in an email.

Even unexploded targets pose a hazard to wildland workers and visitors, said Laura Mark, the U.S. Forest Service's regional special agent in charge.

"Explosives ordnance demolition experts have had to respond on three occasions this year to safely dispose of unused targets that had been mixed but not yet used," Mark said.

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is also exploring banning the targets on the 8.1 million acres (3.3 million hectares) of public land it manages in Colorado, according to BLM Ranger John Bierk.

Violators of the newly imposed ban face fines up to $5,000 and a maximum six months in prison.



headline: Vigil at Wisconsin Sikh temple marks anniversary of shooting attack
byline: By Brendan O'Brien
8:31am EDT

Hundreds of mourners gathered on Monday for a candlelight vigil at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in suburban Milwaukee to commemorate the lives of six worshippers killed there a year ago by a white supremacist during a mass shooting.

In that attack, Wade Michael Page walked into the temple in Oak Creek as worshippers prepared for Sunday services and began firing a semiautomatic handgun.

Satwant Singh Kaleka, the 65-year-old president of the congregation; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39; Paramjit Kaur, 41; and Suveg Singh, 84, died of wounds.

Next to the temple where the shooting occurred, a fire truck ladder lifted a large American flag behind a makeshift stage on a lawn, where several dignitaries and Sikh community members gave emotional speeches.

Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi said he had "grown to love" Sikh temple members "as family members because they've shown me compassion and kindness, even in the midst of their great sorrow."

Mourners sat on chairs or stood while wearing white scarves on their heads and holding long, white candles throughout the two-hour vigil, which included Sikh prayer and song.

"It's pretty sad that you have to have tragedy to bring so many people together like this, but when it does happen, it's amazing what we can do," said Pam Fleming, 13, who attended the vigil with her father Brian, a police officer.

Four other people were wounded in the shooting, including Brian Murphy, a police officer who was shot a dozen times. Page, 40, was shot by police in a temple parking lot before he fatally shot himself.

The rampage at the Sikh temple was one of several mass shootings that marred 2012, including one that took the lives of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

Many speakers during the vigil called for politicians in Washington to address gun violence in the United States.

"We can do better and we must do better to reduce the violence in this country," Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said.

The vigil concluded three days of memorials and events in the Milwaukee area to mark the anniversary of the shooting.

"The Sikh community showed us the best way to respond to the tragedy was with love," Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said in a statement. "It is amazing that in the midst of so much personal loss, the greatness of American character shines through."

The U.S. Justice Department said last week it would provide more than $512,000 to the Wisconsin Department of Justice to help pay for mental health and trauma services for the victims and survivors of the shooting.

The department also said it would begin to track hate crimes specifically against Sikhs along with individuals of the Hindu, Arab, Buddhist, Mormon, Jehovah's Witness and Orthodox Christian faiths.

"It's critical to remember that each American continues to bear the responsibility for understanding that acts of violence against minority faiths do not happen in a vacuum," said Amardeep Singh, co-founder of the Sikh Coalition, in a statement before the vigil.

Sikhs, who wear turbans and have long beards, are sometimes victims of hate crimes by Americans who confuse them for Muslims.

There are 500,000 or more Sikhs in the United States. The Sikh faith is the fifth-largest in the world, with more than 30 million followers.

headline: CBS chief slams Time Warner Cable, calls offer a 'gesture'
byline: By Liana B. Baker
8:31am EDT

CBS Corp Chief Executive Leslie Moonves on Tuesday rejected the latest proposal by Time Warner Cable Inc to end its blackout of the network and dismissed the cable company's offer as a "public relations gesture."

Even though both sides urged each other to return to the negotiating table, talks seemed to have broken down, affecting more than 3 million Time Warner Cable customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas.

In a three-page letter released to the media on Tuesday, Moonves said Time Warner Cable has not reached out to him in any meaningful way to resolve the dispute.

On Monday, Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt made a proposal to Moonves in a letter that he also released to the media, but Moonves said it was not a "sincere offer.

Time Warner Cable blacked out CBS-owned stations and cable networks on Time Warner Cable's systems in two of the largest U.S. markets, New York and Los Angeles, last Friday. The CBS.com website was also affected.

It has deprived viewers of summer sci-fi hit "Under the Dome" and live sports, such as golf, that air on the broadcast network.

In New York, the fracas caught the attention of mayoral candidates, including city Comptroller John Liu. He issued a letter to Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday asking for an emergency meeting to discuss penalties against Time Warner Cable, including a possible termination of its franchise agreement and a fine levied each day a cable channel is dark.

The city of New York declined to intervene. Rahul Merchant, the city's chief information and innovation officer, said in a statement it would be inappropriate for the city to take a side in a dispute between two private companies.

Merchant urged both sides to resolve the dispute as soon as possible, and said the city will exercise its authority to make sure cable customers who cancel their service receive refunds.

Charlie Ergen, chairman of rival satellite provider Dish Network Corp, predicted the blackout would lead to a decline in CBS viewership and more "cord cutting" by customers who drop their pay TV service.

"They will watch some other shows because they will realize they don't miss it or they discovered new programming that they didn't know existed before, or they went to the Internet and cut the cord and never came back" Ergen said on a conference call after his company reported quarterly results.

Dish has frequently taken channels off the air to gain leverage in fee battles. Last Thursday, broadcaster Raycom Media was blocked from Dish's system in a dispute that remains unresolved.

CBS said it expected minimal impact to its nationwide ratings from the standoff with Time Warner Cable. Through the first four nights, it estimated a 1 percent decline in viewership due to the blackout.

Moonves also said the cable company's offer on Monday to sell CBS channels to subscribers one-by-one on an "a la carte" basis an "empty gesture" and unrealistic and countered the cable company to offer its pricy regional sports network channels in the same manner.

In response to Moonves' letter, a Time Warner Cable spokesman said: "We're disappointed that they've offered no solutions; we've offered two. Our offer was sincere, and they still haven't addressed the blocking of CBS.com."

On Monday, Time Warner Cable rival Verizon FiOS said it was receiving requests for service from Time Warner Cable customers who could not watch CBS.

Shares of CBS edged down 0.1 percent to $53.91, while Time Warner Cable fell 2.1 percent to $113.97 on the New York Stock Exchange.

headline: Ex-Penn State officials plead not guilty to Sandusky cover-up charges
byline: By Daniel Kelley
8:31am EDT

The trio of former Penn State administrators accused of covering up Jerry Sandusky's child sex abuse pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in court papers filed on Monday.

The university's former president, Graham Spanier, 65; former athletic director, Tim Curley, 59; and former senior vice president, Gary Schultz, 63, waived their right to appear at a formal arraignment in September on charges including endangering the welfare of children, obstruction of justice and criminal conspiracy.

The legal filings come after the three men were ordered last week to stand trial for their role in what prosecutors have called a "conspiracy of silence" aimed at covering up accusations that Sandusky was sexually abusing children, sometimes in the Penn State locker room showers.

Sandusky, 69, a former assistant football coach, was convicted in June 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse involving 10 boys. He is serving a sentence of 30 to 60 years in a state prison.

At last week's hearing, prosecutors introduced 1998 emails that show Spanier, Curley and Schultz in 1998 discussed a mother's allegation that Sandusky had showered with her 11-year-old son, and that late legendary football coach Joe Paterno also was aware of the incident.

Those emails run counter to what Spanier told a 2011 grand jury - that he had no knowledge of the 1998 allegation, nor did he know whether Curley and Schultz knew of the incident.

At the hearing, a second incident was described in detail by former assistant football coach, Mike McQueary, who said he saw Sandusky abusing a child in the showers in 2001. McQueary said he told Paterno, Curley and Schultz, but no one reported it to the police.

Prosecutors say the continuing silence permitted Sandusky to keep preying on boys, most of whom he met through a charity he founded for at-risk youth.

Sandusky was arrested in November 2011 in the scandal that rocked the world of college sports.

old Utah hometown beauty pageant winner was among four people arrested on suspicion of throwing homemade bombs at houses in a Salt Lake City suburb over the weekend, authorities said on Monday.

Beauty queen Kendra Gill, crowned Miss Riverton in June, and three other 18-year-olds were arrested on Saturday on suspicion of detonating incendiary devices during a bomb-throwing spree that began on Friday night, Unified Fire Authority Captain Clint Mecham said.

"This wasn't just like kids blowing up a mailbox," he said.

Police received numerous calls late on Friday about the sound of explosions or gunshots in a Riverton neighborhood where investigators later found remnants of bombs constructed from household chemicals, aluminum foil and plastic water bottles.

Residents of the neighborhood and other areas of Riverton reported that the devices were being thrown from a dark-colored car, according to arrest records.

A resident of one of the homes targeted told investigators her former boyfriend, Bryce Stone, owned a car matching that description. Stone later told investigators he had spent the evening "â&euro;&tilde;pranking' with fireworks with friends," records show.

Gill, Stone and two other 18-year-olds were arrested on suspicion of 10 felony counts of setting off explosives, according to booking documents. They were each released on $50,000 bail on Sunday, jail officials said.

No one was injured by the blasts, which caused minor property damage, but the explosives could have caused severe harm from acid burns or shrapnel, Mecham said.

Officials with the Miss Utah Scholarship Pageant said they have taken no action since no official charges have been filed against Gill.

"We're supportive of her and the local Riverton pageant organization," said spokeswoman Justi Lundeberg. "Since no formal charges have been brought, we're hopeful this will just blow over and we'll consider it an unfortunate event."



headline: Detroit launches two-month review of city assets

8:31am EDT

Detroit will begin to assess the value of its assets, including parking meters, real estate, and a portion of the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) collection, in what the city called a "necessary part" of its restructuring efforts.

The city said on Monday it has hired famed auction house Christie's to appraise the city-owned portion of the DIA's 60,000-piece collection as well as advise Detroit officials on how to realize value for the art without selling it.

Detroit is also hiring outside experts to gauge the value of assets including parking garages, the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and the Coleman A. Young International Airport.

"It doesn't mean that we have any particular plans to sell any particular assets in any sort of fashion," Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr said in a video posted to his YouTube account.

"We have an obligation to perform our duties as a debtor in bankruptcy to make sure we account for all the assets of the city," he added.

Orr wants to finish the assessment by mid-October, in time for the next big step in the bankruptcy process, the October 23 court hearing on whether Detroit is eligible to enter Chapter 9.

"We don't want to lose any time after eligibility has been declared," city spokesman Bill Nowling said in an interview. He added that Detroit tapped Christie's so early in the process because "we think that's going to take the longest amount of time."

Detroit and its creditors are discussing ways to settle at least $18 billion in debt and unfunded liabilities after it filed for bankruptcy protection last month.

Creditors asked for the valuation of city-owned assets, which is a typical part of the bankruptcy process. This effort does not "portend a sale of any asset," Orr said in a statement.

The possibility of selling artwork from the museum has drawn intense criticism, but advocates of the move say preserving art should not outweigh the need to pay pensions and benefits to city workers.

The museum's collection includes an 1887 self portrait of Vincent van Gogh and a 27-panel fresco by Mexican artist Diego Rivera. Roughly 5 percent of the collection was bought with city funds, according to Tim Burns, executive assistant to the museum's director.

"The City must know the current value of all its assets, including the city-owned collection at the DIA," Orr said. "There has never been, nor is there now, any plan to sell art."

'DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED'

Annmarie Erickson, chief operating officer of the Detroit Institute of Art, said she had heard through media reports that Christie's had been hired by the city.

"We are deeply disappointed that Christie's is taking this action, which we believe is contrary to the well-being of the museum," Erickson said.

The museum has said the art cannot be sold because it is held in a charitable trust for the people of Michigan, a position backed by state Attorney General Bill Schuette.

The DIA also hired bankruptcy attorney Richard Levin and set aside funds for legal expenses.

Alternatives to flat-out sales include creating a public-private partnership to run the museum or leasing some of the finest pieces in the collection for a global exhibition that museums would pay to show, arts experts said.

"For example, if the works were sold to donors willing to give the art back to the museum, that's a possibility," said L. Eden Burgess, an attorney with Cultural Heritage Partners who advises on auctions, purchases and sales.

"That way, the art could stay in the city but there still could be value realized from it. That's one possibility. There may be others as well," Burgess said.

Erickson said the museum, which has faced financial difficulties for years, has not been able to find a way to monetize the collection while maintaining its public mission.

Miller Buckfire &amp; Co, Detroit's restructuring investment bank, met with DIA officials in May to discuss the museum's options. At the same time, Miller Buckfire also reached out to Christie's about conducting a valuation.

Erickson said two Christie's officials had visited to the museum in June but had not returned since. The city said Christie's visited the DIA as part of its due diligence.

"They then informed us that they would be suspending their work," she said. "This is the first that we've heard that they've been resuming that work."



headline: Florida executes mass murderer said by lawyers to be mentally ill

minute appeal by lawyers claiming he was insane.

John Errol Ferguson, 65, who was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in 1978 for a pair of killing sprees, was pronounced dead at 6:17 p.m. EDT from lethal injection, said Misty Cash, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Corrections.

Hours before his execution, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Ferguson a stay of execution. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) filed an amicus brief last week, along with three Florida mental health organizations, asking the top court to halt the execution, arguing Ferguson had a long history of severe mental illness.

The brief argued Ferguson's execution would violate the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requiring an individual to have a rational understanding of why he is being put to death and the effect of the death penalty.

"Mr. Ferguson is insane and incompetent for execution by any measure," his attorney, Christopher Handman, said in a statement after the court's decision on Monday.

"He has a fixed delusion that he is the 'Prince of God' who cannot be killed and will rise up after his execution to fight alongside Jesus and save America from a communist plot," Handman said. He has no rational understanding of the reason for his execution or the effect the death penalty will have upon him."

In his last statement, Ferguson uttered, "I just want everyone to know, I am the 'Prince of God' and I will rise again," Cash said.

In July 1977, Ferguson fatally shot six people execution-style during a drug-related home robbery in a northern Miami suburb. Six months later, he killed two teenagers after they left a church meeting.

State psychiatrists and other medical professionals have diagnosed Ferguson as a paranoid schizophrenic with a long history of mental illness, according to his defense team.

Courts, however, have repeatedly rejected claims he was too mentally ill to be executed.

Florida Governor Rick Scott signed Ferguson's death warrant in September, but a few weeks later delayed the execution while a team of physicians met to decide whether Ferguson was mentally competent.

After a 90-minute examination and brief consultation a panel of psychiatrists determined that Ferguson was sane. A state circuit judge agreed in a ruling.

The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in May rejected his appeal, ruling that Ferguson was mentally competent.

"That most people would characterize Ferguson's Prince-of-God belief, in the vernacular, as 'crazy' does not mean that someone who holds that belief is not competent to be executed," the appeals court found.



headline: U.S. to review DEA unit that hides use of intel in crime cases
byline: By John Shiffman and David Ingram
8:31am EDT

The Justice Department is reviewing a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit that passes tips culled from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a large telephone database to field agents, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday.

Reuters reported Monday that agents who use such tips are trained to "recreate" the investigative trail to effectively conceal the DEA unit's involvement from defense lawyers, prosecutors and even judges, a policy many lawyers said could violate a defendant's right to a fair trial. Federal drug agents call the process of changing the true genesis of an arrest "parallel construction," according to a training document.

Although the DEA program may use legal means to collect and distribute the tips, critics say that by hiding the origin of a case, defendants may not know about potentially exculpatory evidence.

"It's my understandingâ&euro;Ś that the Department of Justice is looking at some of the issues raised in the story," Carney said during his daily briefing at the White House on Monday.

Carney referred reporters to a Justice Department spokesman, who confirmed that a review was under way, but declined further comment.

In an interview with Reuters last month, two senior DEA officials defended the program, saying it has been in place since the late 1990s, has been reviewed by every Attorney General since then, and is perfectly legal. One DEA official said "parallel construction" is used every day by agents and police nationwide and is "a bedrock concept."

The program, run by DEA's Special Operations Division, differs in several respects from National Security Agency activities revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Among these is disclosure to the accused.

Collection of domestic data by the NSA and FBI for espionage and terrorism cases is regulated by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. If prosecutors intend to use FISA or other classified evidence in court, they issue a public notice, and a judge determines whether the defense is entitled to review the evidence. In the DEA's case, a document reviewed by Reuters shows that federal drug agents are trained to "recreate" the investigative trail to conceal the SOD's involvement. Defense attorneys say the practice prevents defendants from even knowing about evidence that might help their cases.

In a statement, the NSA said that it cannot use the telephone database program exposed by Snowden for law enforcement purposes. However, the NSA said that it does coordinate with law enforcement.

"This coordination frequently includes sanitizing classified information so that it can be passed to personnel at lower clearance levels in order to meet their operational requirements," the NSA statement said. "If the Intelligence Community collects information pursuant to a valid foreign intelligence tasking that is recognized as being evidence of a crime, the intelligence community can disseminate that information to law enforcement, as appropriate."

While the NSA activities are aimed at terrorists, the SOD program focuses on drug dealers and money launders. That distinction troubles some civil libertarians, who fear secretive measures designed to target terrorists are being used to catch ordinary criminals.

Jerry Cox, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), said defense lawyers "long feared that overbroad national security policies would become the norm for all criminal prosecutions and today we know our concerns were not unfounded."

Ezekiel Edwards, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Criminal Law Reform Project, said the SOD procedures violate the fundamental right to a fair trial. "When someone is accused of a crime, the Constitution guarantees the right to examine the government's evidence, including its sources, and confront the witnesses against them," he said. "Our due process rights are at risk when our federal government hides and distorts the sources of evidence used as the basis for arrests and prosecutions."

headline: San Diego Mayor enters therapy amid sexual harassment allegations
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

San Diego's mayor, facing mounting pressure to resign over sexual harassment allegations from nearly a dozen women, entered an intensive therapy program on Monday, a spokeswoman said.

As Mayor Bob Filner, a Democrat, prepared over the weekend to begin his treatment, a tenth woman came forward to accuse him of inappropriate behavior, saying the 70-year-old mayor had asked her out during a political event in June.

"He took me by the hand and said, 'You are so beautiful I cannot take my eyes off of you," Renee Estill-Sombright told a Fox News station. "Are you married?"

Filner, who took the helm of California's second-largest city last year, has resisted calls to resign after a sexual harassment lawsuit was filed against him last month by his former press secretary. The secretary accused him of telling her she would work better without panties.

Since then, a string of other women have come forward to publicly accuse Filner of making unwanted sexual advances. Both fellow Democrats and rival Republicans have joined forces in a signature drive seeking a recall election to unseat him.

"The behavior I have engaged in over many years is wrong," Filner said when he announced his plan to enter treatment late last month. "My failure to respect women and the intimidating conduct I engaged in at times is inexcusable."

On Monday, spokeswoman Lena Lewis confirmed that Filner had entered a counseling program but did not say where it was located or whether Filner was staying there overnight. Filner had said he would take two weeks off for the counseling program, but promised to stay involved in running the city during that time.

At City Hall on Monday the mayor's office was quiet.

A prominent lawyer for Filner's former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, who filed the lawsuit against him, dismissed Filner's "decision to seek therapy as a ploy to stay in power and to try to gain sympathy.

"It is ridiculous to think that he needs therapy in order to understand that women deserve respect and should not be treated like pieces of meat," lawyer Gloria Allred said.



headline: North Carolina governor signs law for tougher abortion clinic rules
byline: By Karen Brooks
8:31am EDT

North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory signed into law on Monday new requirements for clinics performing abortions that supporters say will protect women's safety and opponents say will restrict access to the procedure.

The new law places sweeping new restrictions on abortion clinics, including a requirement doctors be present when abortions are performed.

It also bans publicly funded health insurance programs from paying for most abortions, and authorizes state health officials to design rules for increased safety standards for abortion clinics.

The move comes just a week after Texas passed new standards on abortion clinics and judges delayed anti-abortion legislation in North Dakota and Alabama.

McCrory, a Republican, said Monday that the North Carolina legislation furthers women's safety but does not unconstitutionally restrict access to the legal procedure.

He had threatened to veto an earlier version of the bill that required abortion clinics to follow the same standards as ambulatory surgery centers, saying it was clearly aimed at shutting down clinics in the state. McCrory said during his campaign that he would not sign legislation aimed at restricting access.

"These higher standards will result in safer conditions for North Carolina women," McCrory said Monday. "This law does not further limit access and those who contend it does are more interested in politics than the health and safety of our citizens."

But abortion-rights advocates said that his signature amounted to a broken promise, because the new standards on clinic doctors will make it impossible for some clinics to continue operating. They vowed to fight the new laws in North Carolina and in other states.

"Over the last month, North Carolina women have stood up to fight back and they aren't just going to stand by and take this," said Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Cecile Richards in a statement. "They're going to take the energy and enthusiasm that has been built here and run with it."



headline: For the Grahams of the Post, stewardship was the mission
byline: By Fred Barbash
8:31am EDT

chairwoman Katharine Graham and listen to her son, Donald Graham, talk about the need to cut expenses.

As they headed for the hotel casino or to the golf course few editors could take Graham's warnings seriously.

They also knew that when the big story broke, they would be told personally by Graham to mobilize without regard to cost. The Grahams tended to describe their mission not as making money but as "stewardship" in the public interest, a message passed down through four generations and from the family to the newspaper's managers.

Post veteran reporter Walter Pincus was hired when Philip Graham, Katharine Graham's husband, was publisher of the Post. "When I first joined, Phil told me that if we ever made" more than a token profit, "we'd be ahead of the game. He thought of it as a public utility," supported financially by television stations and other properties owned by the paper, said Pincus.

By the late 1970s, long before the Internet, it was becoming apparent that the Grahams' public service commitment might not be fully compatible with the growth required of a publicly traded company.

Katharine Weymouth, granddaughter of Katharine Graham and now the Post's publisher, said as much in her comments in the Post Monday after its sale to Amazon's Jeff Bezos was announced.

"If journalism is the mission, given the pressures to cut costs and make profits, maybe is not the best place for The Post."

PRIZES WON, READERS LOST

Former Post executive editor Leonard Downie agreed. "A public corporation, dealing with all this change, is probably less flexible in being able to maximize the potential of a multiplatform news organization like the Washington Post than a private company that does not have to answer to shareholders," he said.

The digital revolution has battered the newspaper industry. Ironically, however, Donald Graham, a technophile in his 60s, quickly grasped the threat the Internet posed and the opportunities it presented, said Larry Kramer, a former Post editor who became a digital news entrepreneur and founder of what became CBS MarketWatch. He is now president and publisher of USA Today.

But Graham kept the Washington Post newspaper and its staff walled off and across the Potomac River from its digital operation in Virginia when it started. That was a mistake, in Kramer's view, that wasn't rectified until 2010, more than a dozen years after the online Post launched.

"They were ahead of their time at certain times," said Kramer. But the online Post "was never fully integrated into the business" until it was too late. By then, "they were in a bit of an identity crisis," he said.

"We expanded the staff like crazy and we went after prizes, not after readers," said Pincus.

During Donald Graham's final 10 years as publisher, ending in 2000, "we won more Pulitzers than any other newspaper and lost 120,000 in circulation." The decline has continued, with paid circulation dropping 14 percent in the past three years, to 480,166.

"A newspaper as a newspaper," said Pincus, "can never generate enough money to keep it coming."

headline: WikiLeaks case harms U.S. diplomacy, Manning sentencing told
byline: By Tom Ramstack
8:31am EDT

U.S. soldier Bradley Manning's leaks of classified government files had a "chilling effect" on foreign relations, impeding U.S. diplomats' ability to gather information, a senior State Department official testified on Monday.

The unauthorized releases made foreign diplomats, business leaders and other information sources "reticent to provide their full and frank opinions and share them with us," Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy said.

"Every single embassy" was affected, said Kennedy, who warned about long-term consequences of Manning's 2010 leaks to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.

The releases will have "a chilling effect that will go on for some time" by cutting off information that political leaders need to make foreign policy decisions, he noted.

Kennedy testified at the sentencing hearing for Manning, who was convicted last week on criminal charges that included espionage. The hearing is to help the court-martial determine how long the private first class should be in prison.

Kennedy was part of a panel that assessed the damage Manning caused to U.S. foreign relations by releasing more than 700,000 classified documents and videos.

At one point, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke out publicly in defense of her colleagues who sent the messages, which are known as diplomatic cables.

Attorneys for Manning quoted other U.S. government officials including former Defense Secretary Robert Gates downplaying any fallout from the releases.

UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE

Judge Colonel Denise Lind found Manning, 25, guilty on July 30 of 19 criminal counts related to the leaks, the largest unauthorized release of secret data in U.S. history. The files included more than 250,000 State Department cables.

Manning was found not guilty of aiding the enemy, the most serious charge, but the crimes still carry penalties that could lead to up to 136 years in prison.

The sentencing phase began last week and is expected to last at least until Friday, military officials said.

Lind made a preliminary ruling that "aggravation evidence" would be disallowed on a case-by-case basis, but deferred a final decision.

Aggravation evidence refers to witness testimony on how the WikiLeaks releases are likely to damage U.S. foreign relations. Manning's attorneys had argued that the evidence was too speculative to be weighed in his sentence.

Under Lind's initial ruling, the defense must object to any new witness and explain reasons why the testimony should not be allowed.

Lind also decided to defer ruling on defense motions to merge some of the charges against Manning into a single sentence rather than multiple ones.

Manning's lawyers have portrayed him as naive but well intentioned. They argue the soldier's aim was to provoke a broader debate on U.S. military policy, not to harm anyone.

level intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2010 when he was charged with leaking files. They included videos of a 2007 attack by a U.S. Apache helicopter gunship in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.

Most of the leaked diplomatic cables originated after 2005, when a new information-sharing system was adopted to address intelligence failings exposed by the attacks of September 11, 2001.

Kennedy was among several witnesses for the government, including one who said Manning's leak undid part of a U.S. intelligence-sharing system. Manning's lawyers will also have a turn to call their own witnesses.

headline: L.A.'s Venice Beach community reels after deadly car rampage
byline: By Dan Whitcomb
8:31am EDT

The seaside community of Venice Beach was still reeling on Monday after a man plowed a car through a crowd at the boardwalk, killing an Italian woman on her honeymoon and injuring 11 others, and police identified the driver as a transient with no strong ties to Southern California.

Nathan Campbell, 38, was arrested late on Saturday. Police said he abandoned the car blocks from the scene of the carnage and walked to a police station in the adjacent community of Santa Monica. He was booked on suspicion of murder and could face formal charges as early as Tuesday.

Witnesses have said it appeared the driver had been aiming for pedestrians on Saturday when he steered down the popular oceanfront walkway in Venice at speeds up to 20 miles per hour while people screamed and ran.

Security camera footage aired on ABC News showed the driver of the dark-colored Dodge Avenger parking across from a cafe and getting out. In the video, he scans the area, then gets in the car and drives into the throng before backing up and driving toward another group of people.

Police have said little about what might have motivated the rampage at a top Southern California tourist destination, but Los Angeles Police spokesman Andrew Neiman said that Campbell made incriminating statements to officers in Santa Monica.

"Sometime later after he drove away he did turn himself into the Santa Monica Police Department. That's where we caught up with him," Neiman said. "He said something that prompted Santa Monica officers to contact us, and we responded."

Neiman declined to elaborate on Campbell's statements or other evidence while the investigation was underway.

VIGIL PLANNED

Neiman said Campbell, who was being held on $1 million bail, did not have long-term ties to Venice Beach or the Los Angeles area, describing him as a transient who has previously lived in Colorado.

At the boardwalk, a patchwork of street vendors, souvenir shops, restaurants and sporting areas in one of the city's quirkiest neighborhoods, flowers and cards were left at the scene where 32-year-old Alice Gruppioni was killed and 11 others injured. Police identified Gruppioni as a tourist from Italy who was spending her honeymoon in California.

Dennis Walker, general manager of the Candle Cafe &amp; Grill on the boardwalk, said stunned and dismayed employees there were organizing a vigil for Monday night to remember Gruppioni and the injured.

"One of our vendors and one of our regular guests got injured," Walker said. "I have two servers working this morning who have been here 19 and 12 years respectively. This is a very close-knit community."

Walker said security cameras from the restaurant captured part of the incident and, in his mind, made it clear that the driver drove into crowds on the boardwalk "meticulously and intentionally."

Meanwhile a Los Angeles City Council member, Mike Bonin, said he would seek to have barricades put in place to restrict car access to the boardwalk.

"While most of the streets that run into Ocean Front Walk are unimpeded, the site of last night's horrible tragedy actually had four bollards blocking the street, but apparently the assailant sped right around them, over the sidewalk and into the crowd," Bonin said in a Facebook post.

will select committee members.

Federal bankruptcy Judge Steve Rhodes' ruling on the city's effort to create a new negotiating partner independent of unions and pension funds was a key moment in a three-hour session that packed the largest courtroom in Detroit's downtown federal building. Rhodes also put off setting a date for a hearing on Detroit's eligibility to file for bankruptcy, while Detroit lawyers disclosed an ambitious aim to present a plan for reorganization by the end of 2013.

Detroit, whose course in bankruptcy court is being set by a state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, set its target date at least three months earlier than the March 2014 deadline Rhodes previously had proposed.

Outside of court, Orr on Friday also proposed a new healthcare plan for city workers that would save Detroit $12 million annually by raising deductibles and trimming the number of available plans.

The next step in the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy will be a trial beginning on October 23 to determine whether Detroit is eligible for a Chapter 9 bankruptcy. To remain in bankruptcy court, Detroit must prove it is insolvent and has negotiated in good faith with creditors owed more than $18 billion, or that there are too many creditors to make negotiating feasible.

Pension funds and unions representing city workers are expected to contest Detroit's eligibility.

An attorney for the city also disclosed Detroit is in regular but pointed dialogue with creditors even while in bankruptcy court. "There are significant differences that we feel will be difficult to breach," said David Heiman, an attorney who represents the city.

CONTENTIOUS COMMITTEE ISSUE

Detroit, a former manufacturing powerhouse and cradle of the U.S. automotive industry and Motown music, has struggled for decades as companies moved or closed, crime surged, and its population dwindled. The city's revenue fell short of spending, while city budgets and borrowing ballooned.

The city now says it can't afford to pay its retired workers the pensions and benefits they were promised. The committee that the trustee will select could help determine how much money and benefits the retirees may lose.

Unions argued the committee should include labor union representatives. They also asked the judge to adjust his proposed timetable for the case to allow the committee to become established and permit negotiation and mediation with the city.

U.S. Trustee Daniel McDermott will form the committee, though Judge Rhodes has the power to reject the committee's composition if it lacks adequate representation.

Brian O'Keefe, an attorney who represents associations of retired Detroit police, firefighters and city employees, said it was important the city not dictate the committee's composition.

"We were objecting to the fact that it seemed like the city wanted to be involved in the structuring of the committee and I think Judge Rhodes made it clear that it really will be up to the U.S. Trustee," said O'Keefe.

PENSION DISPUTE

The judge approved the city's offer to pay costs associated with the retiree committee's work. And Edward McNeil, the lead negotiator for a coalition of 33 of Detroit's 48 labor unions, told Reuters the union expects the city's funding to cover the cost of an independent actuarial study of the city's unfunded pension liability.

Orr, the city's emergency manager, contends the city faces $3.5 billion in unfunded liability, though the city prior to Orr's estimate in June had put the unfunded liability at $644 million for 2011. A larger unfunded liability could increase pressure on retirees and workers to make concessions to help Detroit fix its failed finances.

Estimates of pension valuations vary widely based on a number of factors, including return on investments and 30-year amortization of pension obligations. Rachel Barkley, a municipal credit analyst at Morningstar who studied the way Detroit calculated pensions valuations, said Detroit was within industry norms in its calculations.

"We feel an 8 percent investment return may not be conservative but definitely would be defensible by the city," she said.

BANKRUPTCY TIMELINE

Lawyers for some city unions argued Judge Rhodes' proposed schedule for the eligibility phase - at which the city must prove it belongs in bankruptcy - was too tight and left little time for discovery. Rhodes had proposed an October 23 trial date.

"The whole schedule as a package is fairly aggressive," said Babette Ceccotti, a lawyer for the United Auto Workers, one of the city's unions.

Rhodes did not set a firm date for the eligibility trial and said he would consider concerns about scheduling and set an August 21 date for the next hearing in the case.

During the hearing, Rhodes said he intends to appoint an examiner to review the fairness of fees charged by Detroit's lawyers and other service providers.

He gave the parties seven days to nominate candidates for the job. He also put off any action on a simmering debate over a deal Detroit struck with counterparties to interest-rate swap agreements that would save the city more than $70 million.

Detroit's target of filing a reorganization plan by year-end compares with the March 1 date proposed earlier this week by Rhodes. While the city would "enthusiastically accept" the judge's deadline, Heiman said, it wants to move faster.

"Our view is that time is our enemy," Heiman said. "The facts are not going to change no matter how long we wait. ... So we aim to file a plan by the end of the year."

The target date for Detroit's reorganization plan may prove tough to meet if recent municipal bankruptcies are any guide.

Stockton, California, took nearly a year just to prove its eligibility for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, and San Bernardino, California, is still awaiting a declaration more than a year after filing for protection.

Detroit's bankruptcy has drawn national attention at a time when many cities and states are dealing with budget deficits and pension crises.

St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, in remarks after speaking at a Boston conference Friday, warned bankruptcy will not be a quick fix.

"Declaring bankruptcy is no panacea," Bullard said. "It is not a solution. It is a mess."



headline: Vigil at Wisconsin Sikh temple to mark anniversary of shooting attack
byline: By Brendan O'Brien
8:31am EDT

Hundreds of mourners are expected to gather on Monday for a candlelight vigil at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in suburban Milwaukee where a white supremacist opened fire a year ago, killing six worshippers.

In that attack, Wade Michael Page walked into the temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin as worshippers prepared for Sunday services and began firing a semiautomatic handgun.

Satwant Singh Kaleka, the 65-year-old president of the congregation; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39; Paramjit Kaur, 41; and Suveg Singh, 84, died of wounds.

Four other people were wounded in the shooting, including Brian Murphy, a police officer whom Wade shot a dozen times. Page, 40, was shot by police in a temple parking lot before he fatally shot himself.

The vigil will conclude three days of memorials and events in the Milwaukee area to mark the anniversary of the shooting.

"The Sikh community showed us the best way to respond to the tragedy was with love," Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said in a statement. "It is amazing that in the midst of so much personal loss, the greatness of American character shines through."

The U.S. Justice Department said last week it would provide more than $512,000 to the Wisconsin Department of Justice to help pay for mental health and trauma services for the victims and survivors of the shooting.

The department also said it would begin to track hate crimes specifically against Sikhs along with individuals of the Hindu, Arab, Buddhist, Mormon, Jehovah's Witness and Orthodox Christian faiths.

"It's critical to remember that each American continues to bear the responsibility for understanding that acts of violence against minority faiths do not happen in a vacuum," said Amardeep Singh, co-founder of the Sikh Coalition.

Sikhs, who wear turbans and have long beards, are sometimes victims of hate crimes by people who confuse them for Muslims.

There are 500,000 or more Sikhs in the United States. The Sikh faith is the fifth-largest in the world, with more than 30 million followers.

The rampage at the Sikh temple was one of several mass shootings that marred 2012, including one that took the lives of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

8:31am EDT

Prosecutors on Monday told jurors that James "Whitey" Bulger was the "vicious, violent and calculating" Boston mob boss his former gang mates had described at his murder and racketeering trial, while defense attorneys urged jurors not to trust career criminals who had cut plea deals.

Each side's closing statement focused on testimony of three former members of Bulger's "Winter Hill" gang who described 19 murders the defendant was charged with committing or ordering in the 1970s and '80s.

"The evidence in this trial has convincingly proven that the defendant was one of the most vicious, violent and calculating criminals to ever walk the streets of Boston," assistant U.S. attorney Fred Wyshak said in summing up the eight-week-long trial.

Bulger, 83, has pleaded not guilty to all criminal counts and the jury is expected to begin deliberating on Tuesday.

Wyshak recounted the testimony of three top Bulger allies: Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi, John "The Executioner" Martorano and Kevin Weeks. The former members of Bulger's gang testified that Bulger ordered or himself carried out murders of gangland rivals, suspected informants and two women. They also testified about extortion schemes in which Bulger's gang shook down both fellow criminals and local business owners.

"These men were the scariest people walking the streets of Boston," Wyshak said.

'BUYING TESTIMONY'

Bulger's attorneys asked whether jurors could believe the word of three convicted criminals who got more lenient sentences for testifying against Bulger. Martorano served 12 years after confessing to 20 murders and Weeks served five years after admitting a role in five killings. Flemmi, the last to cooperate with prosecutors, is serving a life sentence but avoided the death penalty.

"The government is buying the testimony of these witnesses. Sounds pretty awful if you put it that way doesn't it?" said defense attorney J.W. Carney. "The currency that's used here? How much freedom is this person going to get."

Defense attorney Henry Brennan suggested that in focusing on Bulger and his relationship with corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, prosecutors sought to distract the jury from what they described as a twisted law-enforcement culture where agents who shared Bulger's Irish ethnicity overlooked his crimes as they focused on the Italian-American Mafia.

"Did they give those people deals because they liked them or to protect something more important to them - themselves?" Brennan asked

Bulger, who has lost the shock of light hair that earned him the nickname "Whitey" in his youth, sat quietly in court writing notes in a yellow legal pad.

His story has fascinated Boston for years. He rose from living in a gritty housing project to become the city's most feared crime lord while his brother, William, wielded political power, rising to president of the Massachusetts state senate.

The gangster served time in Alcatraz early in his long criminal career. After escaping Boston on a tip from a corrupt FBI agent that arrest was imminent, he lived as a fugitive for 16 years before his capture in California two years ago.

His story inspired the character played by Jack Nicholson in Martin Scorsese's Academy Award-winning film "The Departed."

During the trial, the defense admitted Bulger had been a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark, in short, an "organized criminal." They argued most strenuously against one government assertion: that Bulger was an FBI informant, who rose to power with the help of corrupt law enforcement agents who turned a blind eye to his crimes.

BLACK ERA FOR FBI IN BOSTON

Wyshak on Monday showed the jury a 700-page file that Connolly produced over more than a decade of regular meetings with Bulger and Flemmi, which recounted tips they had provided about rival gangs, some true and some not.

Bulger adamantly denies having served as an informant, or "rat" in gang parlance, contending he paid Connolly off and that the agent invented the contents of the file to provide a cover for his regular meetings with the mobster.

Bulger's profane outbursts in the courtroom have been triggered by former criminal associates' assertions that he was an informant.

"This trial is not about whether Mr. Bulger was an FBI informant," Wyshak said. "Why has it been so hotly contested in this trial? Because Mr. Bulger cares more about his reputation as an FBI informant than he does about his reputation as a murderous thug."

Connolly is serving a 40-year prison sentence for murder and racketeering.

The former associates who testified against Bulger also bristled at the idea of being labeled "rats." Defense attorney Carney questioned the contention in Martorano's testimony that the news Bulger had been an informant "broke my heart."

Pointing out that Martorano had provided detailed, dispassionate testimony on a series of murders, Carney quipped: "I think if you did a CT-scan, you'd have trouble finding a heart in this guy."



headline: Two killed, five wounded in shooting in Central California

A gunman fired into a crowd during a fight outside a California taco restaurant early on Monday, killing two people and wounding five others, police said.

The shooting erupted during a fight between several people that began inside the Tacos Choice restaurant in Salinas, about 100 miles south of San Francisco, and spilled outside into the parking lot, Salinas Police Commander David Shaw said.

The shooter fired into a crowd that had formed around the fight, instantly killing a 22-year-old man and wounding a 28-year-old man who later died at a nearby hospital, Shaw said.

Five more people were wounded in the shooting, including a 25-year-old man, who was being treated for life-threatening injuries, and a 53-year-old woman, who was shot multiple times, according to a police report.

The three other victims suffered from single gunshots and were not seriously injured, the report said.

"Some of the people in the crowd engaged in the fight and others were either standing by or in the area, possibly just leaving the restaurant," Shaw said.

Shaw said the shooting is being investigated as gang related. He no arrests have been made and that he did not know if any of the shooting victims were affiliated with gangs.

The city of Salinas, made famous in the novels of John Steinbeck, has long suffered from gang violence, stemming mainly from the predominant Nortenos and Surenos street gangs, Shaw said.

headline: How DEA program differs from recent NSA revelations
byline: By John Shiffman
8:31am EDT

security needs by disclosing details of secret U.S. government surveillance programs.

Reuters has uncovered previously unreported details about a separate program, run by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, that extends well beyond intelligence gathering. Its use, legal experts say, raises fundamental questions about whether the government is concealing information used to investigate and help build criminal cases against American citizens.

The DEA program is run by a secretive unit called the Special Operations Division, or SOD. Here is how NSA efforts exposed by Snowden differ from the activities of the SOD:

Purpose of the programs

NSA: To use electronic surveillance to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation catch terrorists, the U.S. military fight wars, and the Central Intelligence Agency collect intelligence about foreign governments.

SOD: To help the DEA and other law enforcement agents launch criminal investigations of drug dealers, money launderers and other common criminals, including Americans. The unit also handles global narco-terrorism cases.

Gathering of evidence

NSA: Much of what the agency does remains classified, but Snowden's recent disclosures show that NSA not only eavesdrops on foreign communications but has also created a database of virtually every phone call made inside the United States.

SOD: The SOD forwards tips gleaned from NSA intercepts, wiretaps by foreign governments, court-approved domestic wiretaps and a database called DICE to federal agents and local law enforcement officers. The DICE database is different from the NSA phone-records database. DICE consists of about 1 billion records, and is primarily a compilation of phone log data that is legally gathered by the DEA through subpoenas or search warrants.

Disclosure to the accused

NSA: Collection of domestic data by the NSA and FBI for espionage and terrorism cases is regulated by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. If prosecutors intend to use FISA or other classified evidence in court, they issue a public notice, and a judge determines whether the defense is entitled to review the evidence. In a court filing last week, prosecutors said they will now notify defendants whenever the NSA phone-records database is used during an investigation.

SOD: A document reviewed by Reuters shows that federal drug agents are trained to "recreate" the investigative trail to conceal the SOD's involvement. Defense attorneys, former prosecutors and judges say the practice prevents defendants from even knowing about evidence that might be exculpatory. They say it circumvents court procedures for weighing whether sensitive, classified or FISA evidence must be disclosed to a defendant.

Oversight

NSA: Congressional leaders and intelligence committee members are briefed on the NSA's classified programs. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court reviews and approves warrants for domestic eavesdropping.

SOD: DEA officials who oversee the unit say the information sent to law enforcement authorities was obtained through subpoena, court order and other legal means. A DEA spokesman said members of Congress "have been briefed over the years about SOD programs and successes." This includes a 2011 letter to the Senate describing the DICE database. But the spokesman said he didn't know whether lawmakers have been briefed on how tips are being used in domestic criminal cases.



headline: U.S. extends embassy closings, lawmakers say threat serious
byline: By Tabassum Zakaria
8:31am EDT

The United States extended embassy closures by a week in the Middle East and Africa as a precaution on Sunday after an al Qaeda threat that U.S. lawmakers said was the most serious in years.

The State Department said 19 U.S. embassies and consulates would be closed through Saturday "out of an abundance of caution" and that a number of them would have been closed anyway for most of the week due to the Eid celebration at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

The United States initially closed 21 U.S. diplomatic posts for the day on Sunday. Some of those will reopen on Monday, including Kabul, Baghdad and Algiers.

Four new diplomatic posts - in Madagascar, Burundi, Rwanda and Mauritius - were added to the closure list for the week.

Last week, the State Department issued a worldwide travel alert warning Americans that al Qaeda may be planning attacks in August, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa.

"There is an awful lot of chatter out there," U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."

He said the "chatter" - communications among terrorism suspects about the planning of a possible attack - was "very reminiscent of what we saw pre-9/11."

A National Security Agency surveillance program that electronically collects communications on cellphones and emails - known as intercepts - had helped gather intelligence about this threat, Chambliss said.

It was one of the NSA surveillance programs revealed by former spy agency contractor Edward Snowden to media outlets.

Those programs "allow us to have the ability to gather this chatter," Chambliss said. "If we did not have these programs then we simply wouldn't be able to listen in on the bad guys."

'SERIOUS THREAT'

"This is the most serious threat that I've seen in the last several years," Chambliss said.

U.S. military forces in the Middle East region have been on a higher state of alert for the past several days because of the threat, a U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The threat also has prompted some European countries to close their embassies in Yemen, home to an al Qaeda affiliate that is considered one of the most dangerous: al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

Yemeni soldiers blocked roads around the U.S. and British embassies in Sanaa, while troops with automatic rifles stood outside the French Embassy.

Interpol, the France-based international police agency, on Saturday issued a global security alert advising member states to increase vigilance against attacks after a series of prison breaks in Iraq, Libya and Pakistan.

"Al Qaeda is in many ways stronger than it was before 9/11, because it's mutated and it spread and it can come at us from different directions," U.S. Representative Peter King, a Republican, said on ABC's "This Week."

"And al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is probably the most deadly of all the al Qaeda affiliates," he said.

Republicans and Democrats alike on Sunday television talk shows said the threat was serious and sought to defuse the controversy over the NSA surveillance programs, which critics say are an invasion of privacy and civil rights.

"The good news is that we picked up intelligence. And that's what we do. That's what NSA does," U.S. Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on ABC's "This Week."

"We've received information that high-level people from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are talking about a major attack," he said.

The threat information came just before the Eid celebration at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan later this week and just over a month before the anniversary of al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

A September 11 attack last year killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans in Benghazi.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on CNN's "State of the Union" that the actions taken to close the embassies and issue the global travel alert showed the Obama administration had learned lessons from Benghazi.

"Benghazi was a complete failure. The threats were real there. The reporting was real. And we basically dropped the ball. We've learned from Benghazi, thank God, and the administration is doing this right," he said.

area commuters scrambling for alternate routes to work, officials said.

Union officials said striking drivers are expected to return to work in time for the Monday morning commute after marathon negotiations produced a tentative three-year pact between Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1433 and bus operator First Transit Inc, which is part of FirstGroup Plc.

"It's been a long, hard fight and we feel we have a good contract to take back to our members," said Bob Bean, the union local's president. "We're happy we got it done today so the public has access to buses again and kids can go to school tomorrow."

The Arizona strike left riders on 40 mostly suburban routes without service in the cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa and Tempe and other routes that reached into Phoenix and Scottsdale.

Most bus routes serving Phoenix are run by different companies and were not affected. A limited light rail system that serves the Phoenix valley also remained running.

Negotiators hammered out the final contract details in a 24-hour-plus bargaining session that ended at midday on Sunday. The deal included what union officials said were last-minute agreements on time spent on the job by drivers and health care contributions.

No wage-related details were immediately released. The pact must be approved by rank-and-file bus drivers, with voting to occur over the next 10 days.

The union's Bean said picket lines will be withdrawn immediately as a show of good faith.

Nick Promponas, First Transit's senior vice president, said the company was confident that the agreement "serves the best interests" of all those involved.

"While we regret that a strike was not averted during the course of the negotiations, we appreciate that the ATU (union) has shared our desire to resume transit service throughout the community as quickly as possible," Promponas said in a statement.

First Transit and union officials were embroiled in talks since the beginning of the year to forge a contract for the roughly 400 drivers who walked off the job early on Thursday.

During the strike, commuters had to drive their own vehicles, carpool, bicycle or walk to work in more than 100-degree Fahrenheit temperatures.

The agreement came just in time for thousands of students who take to the bus to and from school. Schools will start for many students on Monday.

hour commute, effectively prohibiting a walkout for seven days after the sides failed to reach a contract agreement.

Federal and state mediators had worked without success with negotiators for the area's train system, BART, and the two unions representing its workers late into Sunday night to try to reach a deal to avert a strike ahead of a midnight deadline.

To prevent travel chaos, Governor Jerry Brown appointed a three-member board to investigate the possible strike, and in a letter to both sides said state law would prohibit a walkout during the course of the week-long inquiry.

Brown's letter said he took the action "because the strike will significantly disrupt public transportation services and will endanger the public's health, safety, and welfare."

San Francisco area residents had been bracing for a strike even as 11th-hour talks continued, with some sleeping at friends' and relatives' homes to be closer to jobs and making alternative travel arrangements.

The unions gave a 72-hour notice on Thursday night of a possible strike by 2,400 workers on a rail system that carries 400,000 passengers a day and serves as a critical link in the San Francisco area's transportation system.

The unions say they are at loggerheads with management over wages, benefits and safety issues. They contend that despite a proposed 8 percent pay rise over four years, workers would still come home with less money after paying proposed increased contributions to pensions and health-insurance premiums.

Brown's action came after BART management asked him to declare a cooling off period to allow negotiations to continue without a disruption in the public transit system for at least 60 days, a BART statement said.

"The union is extremely disappointed," said Josie Mooney, a negotiator for one of the unions. She said that the unions and the public "waited for 22 hours on pins and needles" for a new contract offer but got nothing.

"We are deeply concerned," she said.

TRAFFIC-CHOKED HIGHWAYS

BART workers walked off the job in early July for the first time since 1997, before agreeing to a 30-day cooling-off period and returning to work after four days. They said they would strike again on Monday if a contract was not reached by midnight.

Last month's strike forced BART passengers to work from home, drive, carpool or crowd onto a limited number of buses and ferries for prolonged, frustrating commutes.

Traffic-choked highways, particularly across the Bay Bridge linking San Francisco to East Bay communities, left some in the generally labor friendly area upset with the strikers.

A poll by the Bay Area Council, a business-sponsored policy group, found 70 percent of 475 area residents polled opposed a strike, while 41 percent said they wanted the transit agency to use available resources to raise employee compensation.

The poll, conducted in early August, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

Thomas Wong, 30, who rides BART between his Pleasant Hill home and his job in San Francisco, said he feels little sympathy for the workers.

"They're so much better off than a lot of other people in the Bay Area and around the country, and they're asking for more," he said, adding that his one-hour commute turned into a 2 1/2-hour nightmare during last month's strike.

Patrick Kallerman, 26, of Oakland, depends on BART to get to work as a policy director for a healthcare consulting firm.

"I would generally categorize myself as being on labor's side," he said. "I think they're getting a fair deal. They make more than I do."

The Bay Area Council Economic Institute estimated that July's strike cost the San Francisco Bay Area $73 million a day in lost worker productivity.



headline: Skydiving instructor killed, student hurt in Mississippi accident

A skydiving instructor died and his student was seriously injured after crash landing in woods in southern Mississippi during a tandem jump, officials said on Sunday.

The instructor, James Horak Jr., 56, was among a group that jumped together after taking off from the Lumberton, Mississippi, airport Saturday morning, said Lamar County Sheriff Danny Rigel.

Other divers accompanying Horak told authorities that the cords Horak used to control the parachute appeared to be tangled, Rigel said.

"Something didn't look right on his main chute," Rigel said, adding the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate.

The name of Horak's student and the extent of his injuries were not immediately known, though he appeared to have suffered broken bones and a head injury, Rigel said.

Horak, of Pensacola, Florida, was an instructor at the Emerald Coast Skydiving Center in Elberta, Alabama. His biography on the company's website identified him as its most experienced instructor, with more than 4,000 jumps to his credit.

Phone messages left with the company Sunday evening were not immediately returned.

minute appeal by lawyers claiming that he is insane.

John Errol Ferguson, 65, who was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in 1978 for a pair of killing sprees, is due to be executed shortly after 6 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT) at Florida State Prison near Starke, Florida.

The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) filed an amicus brief last week, along with three Florida mental health organizations, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the execution, arguing that Ferguson had a long history of severe mental illness.

The brief argues that Ferguson's execution would violate the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requiring an individual to have a rational understanding of why he is being put to death and the effect of the death penalty.

"The death penalty is not constitutionally allowable as a punishment for John Ferguson because his delusions prevent him from understanding the nature of what is happening to him," said Ron Honberg, NAMI's national director of policy and legal affairs.

"The constitutional principle does not excuse his crimes, but it does point to life without parole as the appropriate sentence," he added in a statement.

In July 1977, Ferguson fatally shot six people execution-style during a drug-related home robbery in a northern Miami suburb. Six months later, he killed two teenagers after they left a church meeting.

State psychiatrists and other medical professionals have diagnosed Ferguson as a paranoid schizophrenic with a long history of mental illness, according to his defense team.

Defense attorney Christopher Handman has said Ferguson considers himself "the Prince of God" and does not understand the death penalty and why it had been imposed.

"It is impossible to fathom that the state can constitutionally put to death a man who thinks he is the 'Prince of God' and who believes he has a destiny of being the right hand of God and returning to purify earth after the State tries to kill him," Handman said in a statement before Ferguson's previously scheduled execution last October.

A last-minute court ruling put that on hold amid arguments that he was too mentally ill to be executed.

Courts, however, have repeatedly rejected the claims.

Florida Governor Rick Scott signed Ferguson's death warrant in September, but a few weeks later delayed the execution while a team of physicians met to decide whether Ferguson was mentally competent.

After a 90-minute examination and brief consultation a panel of psychiatrists determined that Ferguson was sane. A state circuit judge agreed in a ruling.

The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in May rejected his appeal, ruling that Ferguson was mentally competent.

"That most people would characterize Ferguson's Prince-of-God belief, in the vernacular, as 'crazy' does not mean that someone who holds that belief is not competent to be executed," the appeals court found.

Posing as a utility company worker, Ferguson entered the home of Margaret Wooden, 24, on July 27, 1977 in the Miami suburb of Carol City. He pulled a gun, tied her up and called two accomplices into the home to search for drugs and money.

Six of Wooden's friends arrived at the house soon after and were tied up. Her boyfriend, Michael Miller, 24, also turned up. Six of the victims, including Miller, were shot to death. Wooden and another person escaped.

Ferguson was also found guilty of the abduction and killing of two 17-year-old Miami high school students.

According to court records, Ferguson abducted Belinda Worley and her boyfriend, Brian Glenfeldt, after they left a social event at a church on January 8, 1978.

Their bodies were found the next day in a nearby wooded area. Glenfeldt was shot in the head, chest and arm. Worley was found in dense brush with a gunshot to the back of the head. An autopsy revealed she had been raped.



headline: Raytheon sees 'never-ending opportunity' in Patriot missile system
byline: By Andrea Shalal-Esa
8:31am EDT

Raytheon Co is poised to book billions of dollars worth of orders for its Patriot air and missile defense system in the coming months, underscoring the resurgence of a weapon first developed to defend Europe against a possible Soviet attack.

Three decades later, the system has been upgraded multiple times and more than 200 fire units are in use in a dozen countries, with additional customers in talks to buy into a system that just a few years ago looked ready to wind down.

Raytheon Chief Executive William Swanson last month called the system "a never-ending opportunity" after a major redesign as part of a $3.3 billion order from the United Arab Emirates in 2008 that has spawned multiple new orders and launched a new chapter in the program's history.

"Once you upgrade it you can go back to all your other customers and offer them the upgraded hardware to reduce their costs, reduce the spare content and so forth. So it's a never-ending opportunity for us here at Raytheon," Swanson told analysts on an earnings call.

Raytheon builds Patriot - a long-range, high-altitude, all-weather system - and acts as the systems integrator for the PAC-3 missile, which is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.

Raytheon officials say they expect several large orders for Patriot systems in the second half of the year, including a deal for 11 fire units from Qatar valued at around $2 billion. They also expect an order exceeding $500 million from Kuwait that could expand further in coming years through related contracts for modernization, spares and services.

Turkey is also weighing a large order that would be worth around $500 million initially, but could expand later.

The Patriot system is already used by 12 countries - United States, Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea and UAE. Raytheon is in active talks to enlarge that group and upgrade existing systems, according to Tim Glaeser, a vice president with Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) division.

Poland is considering buying equipment from Germany, which Raytheon would then upgrade, and India has expressed an interest, as have Singapore and Malaysia, Glaeser said.

The company says more than $400 million has been invested into making the Patriot system faster, smarter and tougher. Components have gotten smaller, computer chips are an eighth of the size they were in 2006, and new units are built in an upgraded facility that uses computer-controlled tools.

Glaeser said the company has streamlined production significantly, making it cheaper to build the Patriot system.

For instance, he said the company had driven the cost of the system's complex antenna down 300 percent, making it possible to swap the whole antenna out if it was not working, rather than having to waste time and money troubleshooting its 5,800 parts.

Raytheon doesn't just earn by building the systems. It also makes money through constant software and other upgrades and maintenance. In June, the company won a $116 million contract from the U.S. Army to provide engineering services, which company officials say will allow them to work on enhancements funded jointly by the U.S. military and international customers.

All Patriot users participate in a special council that meets yearly to consider engineering changes.

MORE USERS, LOWER COSTS

Will Lovell, director of production in the Army's Patriot project office, said the international partnership helped push down the cost of owning and operating the system for all users.

The addition of each new user helped reduce the cost per unit for participating country since the program's baseline costs remained the same, Lovell told Reuters.

"It ... benefits everyone when more countries select Patriot as their missile defense system," he said.

Loren Thompson with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute said Raytheon's Patriot system was riding a major military modernization wave in the Middle East, but also benefited from the U.S. Army's decision to pull out of the next-generation MEADS system that was initially meant to replace Patriot.

A Lockheed-led international consortium is developing the Medium Extended Air and Missile Defense System with funding from the United States, Germany and Italy. Washington plans to end funding this year, after the development program is completed.

"With the waning of MEADS, Patriot is likely to remain the pre-eminent air defense system in the world for the next 20 years," he said. "The reason it's a never-ending opportunity for Raytheon is because its successor was killed."

One of MEADS's key attributes was a 360-degree radar that allows the system to spot threats coming from any direction, something Patriot cannot do.

Glaeser said Raytheon is "exploring options for a 360-degree sensor to meet the requests of our international parties." The Army has said it hopes to harvest some technologies from the MEADS program and reuse them, but it has not released details.

headline: Monotonous, rigid military prison life awaits Manning
byline: By Jonathan Allen
8:31am EDT

Bradley Manning, the soldier convicted in the biggest leak of classified information in U.S. history, faces the prospect of years of monotony with no Internet access in a small military prison cell but he would likely be allowed to mix with other inmates and exercise outdoors.

The 25-year-old Manning, who has yet to be sentenced, would be able to nominate friends and relatives for visits pending official approval. A handshake, a brief kiss or a hug that does not involve touching below the waist are allowed during visits, and visitors and inmates may hold hands, according to regulations. Prisoners are allowed to telephone friends and family through payphones that may only be used at set times, but they are not permitted to send email or browse the Internet.

A military judge on Tuesday found the former low-level intelligence analyst guilty of 19 criminal charges, including espionage and theft, for giving about 700,000 classified diplomatic cables and war logs to the anti-secrecy WikiLeaks website in 2010 while he was serving in Iraq.

The U.S. Army Private First Class was acquitted at his two-month-long court-martial on the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, sparing him a life sentence without parole. But his convictions could draw a maximum term of 136 years.

Legal experts said the case was highly unusual and they were reluctant to predict the sentence. The judge has already ruled that 112 days will be deducted because Manning was mistreated in the months after his arrest in Baghdad in May 2010.

The sentencing phase of the court-martial at Fort Meade, Maryland, began on Wednesday and was expected to last at least until August 9, military officials said.

Any sentence longer than 10 years must be served at the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, U.S. Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel S. Justin Platt said. Manning could also serve time at a Fort Leavenworth military correctional facility, where the spokesman said he had been held pre-trial since April 2011.

Cells, which have walls rather than bars, contain a bed, a toilet and a sink, a desk and a locker, according to unclassified army regulations. The regulations say cells for one person must have 35 square feet (3.25 square meters) of unencumbered space. When confinement exceeds 10 hours per day, there must be at least 80 square feet (7.4 square meters) of total floor space.

TIGHTLY STRUCTURED DAYS

Several people familiar with the prisons described them as clean and relatively safe compared to civilian prisons but said the daily routine was monotonous and tightly structured.

"Most of those guys there have inculcated the hierarchy, the structure, the discipline the respect for authority," said Raelean Finch, a former army intelligence officer who co-writes a blog called "Captain Incarcerated" with a friend and former army colleague serving six years at the Barracks in Fort Leavenworth. (She asked that her friend not be identified further in order to preserve his pseudonym on the blog.)

Finch said that although "it's a tinderbox for sure, tempers flare and whatnot, everyone recognizes they're in a pretty safe situation."

She said many fear being "Fed-Exed" - the term used for being transferred to a civilian federal prison because prisons are perceived as being less disciplined and more violent.

Another blog, "Prison Pie," by a woman who posts her inmate brother's letters, details the routine: Breakfast starts at 5.30 a.m., work hours are between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m., then lunch at noon and back to work at 1 p.m. until 4 p.m., followed by dinner between 4.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. Work includes jobs such as catering, laundry, cleaning and yard maintenance.

There is a lockdown for head count twice a day and 3-1/2 hours of time is allotted for activities such as games and movies in the evening until 9.30 p.m.

MOSTLY PAP LITERATURE

Philip Cave, a lawyer who represents soldiers and visits military prisons, said Manning would be able to borrow from a limited list of books, particularly those with legal information that can help an inmate better understand their case, although there were a few more general-interest titles.

"Mostly pap," said Cave. He said military prisons were more restrictive than civilian prisons about books and magazines, although inmates are allowed to receive titles from friends and relatives that meet official approval.

The former officer Finch said her inmate friend uses a 1990s-vintage refurbished electronic word processor that meets prison guidelines to write his posts, which he prints and sends to her by regular mail since he can't use the Internet.

There is nothing to prevent an inmate writing for publication, the U.S. Army spokesman Platt said, although they may be prevented from receiving compensation for doing so. All correspondence, except between a client and a lawyer, is screened by prison officials.

Cave said that Manning, a slight man who looks younger than his 25 years and is gay, may encounter homophobia, and some inmates may view him as a traitor, although others convicted of espionage are serving time in Fort Leavenworth.

"They may take some extra precautions in the beginning to make sure of his safety," Cave said.

Finch said her inmate friend knew of a number of openly gay inmates. According to him, they do not generally encounter prejudice, tend to socialize among themselves, and sometimes dated within the strictures of a prison environment.

MANNING IN "CAGE" AFTER ARREST

Manning's lawyers and civil rights groups complained that he was mistreated during initial detention in Kuwait and nine months he spent in solitary confinement at a U.S. Marine Corps jail in Quantico, Virginia.

A United Nations special rapporteur on torture formally accused the U.S. government of cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment of Manning. A government lawyer responded that the United States was satisfied Manning had been placed in the same type of cell as other pre-trial detainees.

At Quantico, Manning was confined to his cell for 23 hours a day, required to sleep naked and was woken often during the night, military officials said. They said those measures were necessary because of concern that Manning was suicidal.

To compensate for that treatment, the court-martial judge, Colonel Denise Lind, ruled that 112 days should be deducted from any sentence she imposes.

Influential Republican congressman Paul Ryan disagreed on Sunday with the idea of using the threat of a government shutdown as a means of trying to get rid of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law known as "Obamacare."

Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee and a former vice presidential candidate, said he strongly backs the goal of repealing Obamacare but added there were other, more effective ways of achieving it than by refusing to approve any government funding bill that includes money for the program.

"I think there's going to be a better strategy to actually achieve our goal of ultimately delaying and ultimately replacing Obamacare," the Wisconsin congressman told the CBS talk show "Face the Nation."

Ryan said the shutdown strategy amounted to "swinging for the fences" and wouldn't succeed in gutting Obamacare.

The Republican Party is divided over calls from some conservatives to oppose any annual spending bills that include money for Obamacare. That effort could get in the way of lawmakers' ability to meet an October 1 deadline to pass a funding measure for the federal government. Without such a measure, many government agencies would shut down.

Ryan, author of a Republican budget plan that calls for steep cuts in domestic programs, is considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2016.

Republicans have been on a quest to try to kill Obama's 2010 healthcare law, which is due to begin being implemented in October. They argue that it will burden businesses with higher costs and hurt job creation.

Several Republicans who are potential 2016 presidential rivals to Ryan back the shutdown threat, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. But other Republicans view the strategy as reckless and say it's bound to fail.

Ryan said trying to use the annual spending bills as leverage on Obamacare wouldn't work because it is an entitlement program and most of the money for it is not subject to the annual appropriations process.

Even if Republicans were to succeed in withholding so-called "discretionary" spending for Obamacare, the law would live on, Ryan said.

"Rather than sort of swinging for the fences and trying to take this entire law out with discretionary spending, I think there are more effective ways of achieving that goal. We think that we can do better by delaying this law," he said.



headline: Police in California arrest over 200 at Chevron refinery protest

year anniversary of a massive refinery fire and to protest a proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.

The arrests came as a throng of sunflower-carrying picketers chanted, "Hey hey, ho ho, fossil fuels have got to go," as people of all ages walked onto Chevron's property to draw attention to a growing movement against fossil fuel.

Police Captain Mark Gagan said the arrests, all peaceful, included three people in wheelchairs and demonstrators as young as 18 years old. Media reports said most of those arrested were cited and released.

Environmentalist Bill McKibben, who is leading a call for using only renewable energy, was one of the first to be handcuffed. He had earlier joined Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin in a rally, one in a series across the nation over the environmental consequences of continuing to burn oil and to protest TransCanada Corp's proposed Keystone XL pipeline.

The protest came a day after the city of Richmond filed suit against Chevron over a pipeline rupture and fire that sent a cloud of smoke over the northern California city and neighboring Bay Area communities last August.

The lawsuit seeks damages for the city and its residents and alleges the company ignored repeated warnings, delayed repairs and could have avoided the fire. It followed a dozen similar incidents at Chevron over two decades, the suit says.

"Our community is at risk every day for another fire and explosion," the mayor told the crowd. She said the state Division of Occupational Safety and Health had issued 11 citations of willful neglect to Chevron's Richmond refinery.

A representative for Chevron did not immediately return a call or email seeking comment on the protest and lawsuit on Sunday.

At least 15,000 people went to hospitals with respiratory complaints in the hours and days after the fire.

The Keystone XL pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels a day of crude from Canada's oil sands and the Bakken shale in North Dakota and Montana to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

President Barack Obama's administration is expected to decide whether to approve the pipeline by early 2014.



headline: Ohio death row inmate found hanged days before execution date

An Ohio death row inmate was found hanged in his prison cell on Sunday, three days before he was due to be executed for the 1987 murder of a babysitter, a prison spokeswoman said.

Billy Slagle, 44, had been due to receive a lethal injection at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, according to JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. She said an investigation into Slagle's death was ongoing.

Slagle, who spent 24 years on death row, was convicted in 1988 of the robbery and murder of Mari Anne Pope in Cleveland. Pope, 44, was watching her neighbor's two young children when Slagle broke in and stabbed her 17 times with a pair of scissors.

Slagle's body was found at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution. He was due to be transferred to the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville in preparation for his execution.

Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican, declined to commute Slagle's death sentence to life in prison last month after the state parole board voted against recommending clemency.

Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty recommended Slagle's death sentence be commuted at his clemency hearing. Slagle had said at the July hearing that his judgment was severely impaired by drugs and alcohol when he broke into Pope's home.

Since the death penalty was reinstated in the United States in 1976, Ohio has executed 51 inmates, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. There are more than 140 prisoners on death row in the state.



headline: San Francisco braces for summer rail strike as deadline looms
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

hour commute for the second time this summer, as a midnight deadline to reach a deal on a labor contract for transit workers loomed.

Talks on a deal to avert a Monday morning strike were due to continue on Sunday after negotiators for the city's rapid transit system, BART, and the two biggest unions representing its employees emerged from 13 hours of talks late Saturday night saying they were continuing to exchange proposals.

The unions gave a 72-hour notice on Thursday night of a possible strike by 2,400 workers on a rail system that carries 400,000 passengers a day and serves as a critical link in the San Francisco area's transportation system.

"We're back at the table," BART spokesman Rick Rice told Reuters on Sunday. "We had some good talks yesterday. We're looking forward to more today and keeping the trains running."

The unions say they are at loggerheads with management over wages, benefits and safety issues. They contend that despite a proposed 8 percent pay raise over four years, workers would still come home with less money after paying proposed increased contributions to pensions and health-insurance premiums.

"Things are moving in the right direction, although too slowly and we don't have any more time to waste," Josie Mooney, a chief negotiator for one of the unions, said at a news conference late on Saturday.

"Both parties are going to have to move more quickly tomorrow, and we're going to have to do a lot of work to achieve an agreement," she said.

BART workers walked off the job in early July for the first time since 1997, before agreeing to a 30-day cooling-off period and returning to work after four days. They said they would strike again on Monday if a contract is not reached by midnight.

TRAFFIC-CHOKED HIGHWAYS

A walkout on Monday likely would prove reminiscent of last month's strike, which forced BART passengers to work from home, drive, carpool or crowd onto a limited number of buses and ferries for prolonged, frustrating commutes.

Traffic-choked highways, particularly across the Bay Bridge linking San Francisco to East Bay communities, left some in the generally labor friendly area upset with the strikers.

A poll by the Bay Area Council, a business-sponsored policy group, found 70 percent of 475 area residents polled opposed a strike, while 41 percent said they wanted the transit agency to use available resources to raise employee compensation. The poll, conducted in early August, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

Thomas Wong, 30, who rides BART between his Pleasant Hill home and his job in San Francisco, said he feels little sympathy for the workers.

"They're so much better off than a lot of other people in the Bay Area and around the country, and they're asking for more," he said, adding that his one-hour commute turned into a 2 1/2-hour nightmare during last month's strike.

Patrick Kallerman, 26, of Oakland depends on BART to get to work as a policy director for a healthcare consulting firm.

"I would generally categorize myself as being on labor's side," he said. "I think they're getting a fair deal. They make more than I do."

The Bay Area Council Economic Institute estimated that July's strike cost the San Francisco Bay Area $73 million a day in lost worker productivity.

Ray Fields, a BART worker who earns $24 an hour cleaning train cars, said he was concerned about safety, particularly poor lighting in tunnels and along tracks.

"We really want to address the safety issues," he said. "As far as wages and benefits, we just want something fair. We don't want to inconvenience the Bay Area. We want to work."



headline: U.S. extends embassy closings, lawmakers say threat serious
byline: By Tabassum Zakaria
8:31am EDT

The United States extended embassy closures by a week in the Middle East and Africa as a precaution on Sunday after an al Qaeda threat that U.S. lawmakers said was the most serious in years.

The State Department said 19 U.S. embassies and consulates would be closed through Saturday "out of an abundance of caution" and that a number of them would have been closed anyway for most of the week due to the Eid celebration at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

The United States initially closed 21 U.S. diplomatic posts for the day on Sunday. Some of those will reopen on Monday, including Kabul, Baghdad and Algiers.

Four new diplomatic posts - in Madagascar, Burundi, Rwanda and Mauritius - were added to the closure list for the week.

Last week, the State Department issued a worldwide travel alert warning Americans that al Qaeda may be planning attacks in August, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa.

"There is an awful lot of chatter out there," U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."

He said the "chatter" - communications among terrorism suspects about the planning of a possible attack - was "very reminiscent of what we saw pre-9/11."

A National Security Agency surveillance program that electronically collects communications on cellphones and emails - known as intercepts - had helped gather intelligence about this threat, Chambliss said.

It was one of the NSA surveillance programs revealed by former spy agency contractor Edward Snowden to media outlets.

Those programs "allow us to have the ability to gather this chatter," Chambliss said. "If we did not have these programs then we simply wouldn't be able to listen in on the bad guys."

'SERIOUS THREAT'

"This is the most serious threat that I've seen in the last several years," Chambliss said.

U.S. military forces in the Middle East region have been on a higher state of alert for the past several days because of the threat, a U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The threat also has prompted some European countries to close their embassies in Yemen, home to an al Qaeda affiliate that is considered one of the most dangerous: al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

Yemeni soldiers blocked roads around the U.S. and British embassies in Sanaa, while troops with automatic rifles stood outside the French Embassy.

Interpol, the France-based international police agency, on Saturday issued a global security alert advising member states to increase vigilance against attacks after a series of prison breaks in Iraq, Libya and Pakistan.

"Al Qaeda is in many ways stronger than it was before 9/11, because it's mutated and it spread and it can come at us from different directions," U.S. Representative Peter King, a Republican, said on ABC's "This Week."

"And al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is probably the most deadly of all the al Qaeda affiliates," he said.

Republicans and Democrats alike on Sunday television talk shows said the threat was serious and sought to defuse the controversy over the NSA surveillance programs, which critics say are an invasion of privacy and civil rights.

"The good news is that we picked up intelligence. And that's what we do. That's what NSA does," U.S. Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on ABC's "This Week."

"We've received information that high-level people from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are talking about a major attack," he said.

The threat information came just before the Eid celebration at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan later this week and just over a month before the anniversary of al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

A September 11 attack last year killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans in Benghazi.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on CNN's "State of the Union" that the actions taken to close the embassies and issue the global travel alert showed the Obama administration had learned lessons from Benghazi.

"Benghazi was a complete failure. The threats were real there. The reporting was real. And we basically dropped the ball. We've learned from Benghazi, thank God, and the administration is doing this right," he said.

byline: By Harriet McLeod

The first female graduate of The Citadel military college said on Saturday she will run in the Republican primary against South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who is one of several Republican incumbents facing challenges from the more conservative wing of the party.

Nancy Mace, the first woman to graduate from the previously all-male military college in 1999, announced her candidacy at a local Republican Party meeting in Goose Creek, South Carolina.

Graham, who is seeking his third term in 2014, already has one primary challenger in businessman Richard Cash, and political analysts said there could be more. Graham has a campaign war chest of more than $6 million.

He has been criticized by conservatives for supporting immigration reform and compromising with Democrats on some other issues, though overall he has a conservative voting record.

"There are powerful forces in Washington that consider individual liberty passĂŠ and the Constitution a dead letter. I believe our state desperately needs new leadership," Mace said in announcing her bid.

Mace is the daughter of a former Citadel commandant, retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Emory Mace. She is the author of "In the Company of Men: A Woman at The Citadel."

Several Republican senators up for election could face challenges from the political right. The Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has a primary opponent backed by the Tea Party movement, which seeks deep cuts in U.S. government programs.

The sparring within the party led to the loss of at least one U.S. Senate seat in the 2012 election, when a Tea Party-backed challenger defeated incumbent Republican Richard Lugar in Indiana, only to lose to a Democrat in the general election.



headline: Monotonous, rigid military prison life awaits Manning
byline: By Jonathan Allen
8:31am EDT

Bradley Manning, the soldier convicted in the biggest leak of classified information in U.S. history, faces the prospect of years of monotony with no Internet access in a small military prison cell but he would likely be allowed to mix with other inmates and exercise outdoors.

The 25-year-old Manning, who has yet to be sentenced, would be able to nominate friends and relatives for visits pending official approval. A handshake, a brief kiss or a hug that does not involve touching below the waist are allowed during visits, and visitors and inmates may hold hands, according to regulations. Prisoners are allowed to telephone friends and family through payphones that may only be used at set times, but they are not permitted to send email or browse the Internet.

A military judge on Tuesday found the former low-level intelligence analyst guilty of 19 criminal charges, including espionage and theft, for giving about 700,000 classified diplomatic cables and war logs to the anti-secrecy WikiLeaks website in 2010 while he was serving in Iraq.

The U.S. Army Private First Class was acquitted at his two-month-long court-martial on the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, sparing him a life sentence without parole. But his convictions could draw a maximum term of 136 years.

Legal experts said the case was highly unusual and they were reluctant to predict the sentence. The judge has already ruled that 112 days will be deducted because Manning was mistreated in the months after his arrest in Baghdad in May 2010.

The sentencing phase of the court-martial at Fort Meade, Maryland, began on Wednesday and was expected to last at least until August 9, military officials said.

Any sentence longer than 10 years must be served at the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, U.S. Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel S. Justin Platt said. Manning could also serve time at a Fort Leavenworth military correctional facility, where the spokesman said he had been held pre-trial since April 2011.

Cells, which have walls rather than bars, contain a bed, a toilet and a sink, a desk and a locker, according to unclassified army regulations. The regulations say cells for one person must have 35 square feet (3.25 square meters) of unencumbered space. When confinement exceeds 10 hours per day, there must be at least 80 square feet (7.4 square meters) of total floor space.

TIGHTLY STRUCTURED DAYS

Several people familiar with the prisons described them as clean and relatively safe compared to civilian prisons but said the daily routine was monotonous and tightly structured.

"Most of those guys there have inculcated the hierarchy, the structure, the discipline the respect for authority," said Raelean Finch, a former army intelligence officer who co-writes a blog called "Captain Incarcerated" with a friend and former army colleague serving six years at the Barracks in Fort Leavenworth. (She asked that her friend not be identified further in order to preserve his pseudonym on the blog.)

Finch said that although "it's a tinderbox for sure, tempers flare and whatnot, everyone recognizes they're in a pretty safe situation."

She said many fear being "Fed-Exed" - the term used for being transferred to a civilian federal prison because prisons are perceived as being less disciplined and more violent.

Another blog, "Prison Pie," by a woman who posts her inmate brother's letters, details the routine: Breakfast starts at 5.30 a.m., work hours are between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m., then lunch at noon and back to work at 1 p.m. until 4 p.m., followed by dinner between 4.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. Work includes jobs such as catering, laundry, cleaning and yard maintenance.

There is a lockdown for head count twice a day and 3-1/2 hours of time is allotted for activities such as games and movies in the evening until 9.30 p.m.

MOSTLY PAP LITERATURE

Philip Cave, a lawyer who represents soldiers and visits military prisons, said Manning would be able to borrow from a limited list of books, particularly those with legal information that can help an inmate better understand their case, although there were a few more general-interest titles.

"Mostly pap," said Cave. He said military prisons were more restrictive than civilian prisons about books and magazines, although inmates are allowed to receive titles from friends and relatives that meet official approval.

The former officer Finch said her inmate friend uses a 1990s-vintage refurbished electronic word processor that meets prison guidelines to write his posts, which he prints and sends to her by regular mail since he can't use the Internet.

There is nothing to prevent an inmate writing for publication, the U.S. Army spokesman Platt said, although they may be prevented from receiving compensation for doing so. All correspondence, except between a client and a lawyer, is screened by prison officials.

Cave said that Manning, a slight man who looks younger than his 25 years and is gay, may encounter homophobia, and some inmates may view him as a traitor, although others convicted of espionage are serving time in Fort Leavenworth.

"They may take some extra precautions in the beginning to make sure of his safety," Cave said.

Finch said her inmate friend knew of a number of openly gay inmates. According to him, they do not generally encounter prejudice, tend to socialize among themselves, and sometimes dated within the strictures of a prison environment.

MANNING IN "CAGE" AFTER ARREST

Manning's lawyers and civil rights groups complained that he was mistreated during initial detention in Kuwait and nine months he spent in solitary confinement at a U.S. Marine Corps jail in Quantico, Virginia.

A United Nations special rapporteur on torture formally accused the U.S. government of cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment of Manning. A government lawyer responded that the United States was satisfied Manning had been placed in the same type of cell as other pre-trial detainees.

At Quantico, Manning was confined to his cell for 23 hours a day, required to sleep naked and was woken often during the night, military officials said. They said those measures were necessary because of concern that Manning was suicidal.

To compensate for that treatment, the court-martial judge, Colonel Denise Lind, ruled that 112 days should be deducted from any sentence she imposes.



headline: Disabled woman who won court battle with mother moves in with friends
byline: By Noreen O'Donnell
8:31am EDT

old Virginia woman with Down syndrome who successfully fought her mother's attempt to be her guardian has moved in with friends, according to one of the people she now lives with.

In a case watched carefully by advocates for people with disabilities, Margaret Jean Hatch, who is known as Jenny, had been fighting for nearly a year to be able to choose where to live. She succeeded on Friday.

Newport News, Virginia, Circuit Judge David Pugh decided that although Hatch was not capable of independence and needed a legal guardian, he had to consider the disabled woman's wishes in picking that guardian. He chose her friends, Jim Talbert and Kelly Morris of Hampton, Virginia, for the next year, during which they are to help her gain more independence.

Hatch's mother and stepfather, Julia and Richard Ross, had filed for guardianship. They had wanted her to remain in a group home, which they believed offered the safest environment, the Washington Post reported, citing court records. They asked for the right to decide where she lived, what medical treatment she received and whom she could see.

"We were ecstatic," Talbert said on Saturday of the judge's decision. "We were happy. We were crying. It was an unbelievable victory for Jenny."

Hatch persuaded Talbert and Morris to gather her belongings at the group home immediately rather than wait, Talbert said. She spent Saturday swimming and bowling, he said.

"It's more than just where she wants to live," he said. "I think that Jenny's goal is not to have a guardian and have the right to choose how she directed her life. And obviously you can't do that if you're in a guardianship."

Hatch, who was represented by Jonathan Martinis, the legal director for Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities in Washington, D.C., had worked at a thrift store that Talbert and Morris own. She lived with them in the spring after she was in a bicycle accident.

She wants to return to work at the thrift store, possibly later next week, Talbert said.

"We're not her mother, we're not her father, but she's like one of our family.

If in the future, she wants to move into an apartment, they will try to help her achieve that goal, he said.

Advocates hailed the judge's ruling.

"This decision is a big step in the right direction," Susan Mizner, disability counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. "Like most people with developmental disabilities - and just like all of us - Jenny will learn, grow, and live best when she has the freedom and responsibility to make her own decisions."

Efforts to contact her mother or her lawyer for comment were not successful.



headline: In New York mayor race, lesbian candidate struggles to win women's vote
byline: By Francesca Trianni
8:31am EDT

At Cubbyhole, a popular New York lesbian bar, for every two revelers who praised City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, in her race to become the city's first woman and first openly gay mayor, one complained about her style and political policies.

"Just because she's a lesbian, it doesn't mean I'll vote for her," said Veronica Gonzales, 32, who works for a non-profit organization. "She is not socially liberal enough, and she has this air about her like she is above it all - like she is above us."

While fellow candidate Anthony Weiner's extramarital sexual transgressions have dominated the headlines, a perplexing reality of the race for mayor of the nation's largest city is Quinn's failure to lock up the votes of women and gays, even though she herself is both.

Quinn is the only woman in the race, and the only openly gay candidate, yet she scored only 30 percent support from women in a survey by Quinnipiac University published on July 29. Polls do not break down voting preferences by sexual orientation.

The presumed front-runner of the six candidates vying to succeed Michael Bloomberg has failed to crack the 40 percent level of overall support, the percentage needed to win the Democratic primary on September 10 and avoid a runoff between the top two finishers.

In a runoff with black candidate William Thompson, Quinn would lose 50 percent to 40 percent, the Quinnipiac poll found.

Despite its progressive reputation, New York City has elected few women to citywide office. The best known was Elizabeth Holtzman, who held the top financial post of comptroller from 1990 to 1993. The most recent was Betsy Gotbaum, public advocate until 2009, although Quinn as speaker of the city council is considered the most powerful official after the mayor.

VOTERS AMBIVALENT

In New York's Greenwich Village, with its significant gay and lesbian population, support for Quinn was mixed.

Gonzales plans to vote for Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, who she said is "more straightforward about his agenda."

The ambivalence has contributed to a sense that Quinn is unable to close out the race, and one of the other candidates could overtake her, even as support wanes for Weiner.

"Right now, all signs point to a runoff, and with voters not connecting with anyone in particular, it's going to be a fluid race," said Lee Miringoff of the Marist poll. "It is very important for Quinn to sharpen her message so that she starts to get into a better shape to do better down the road."

Voters critical of Quinn most often mention her style, which some view as brash and calculating. Quinn's backing of a temporary change in the city's term-limits law, which allowed Bloomberg and other lawmakers to run for a third term, has also been used against her.

De Blasio has positioned himself as a liberal alternative to Quinn on issues such as funding for universal pre-kindergarten programs and preventing hospital closings.

"She needs to do better in the long run with women voters," Miringoff said. "If she is going to be successful she needs to create a greater appeal among women voters. And to do that, she needs to put her campaign in an historical context."

In recent weeks, Quinn, long an outspoken proponent of gay marriage, has sought to portray her candidacy as an historic opportunity for New York women.

This week, the Quinn campaign rolled out endorsements from the National Organization of Women and feminist political activist Gloria Steinem.

At the annual Gay Pride parade in Greenwich Village, Quinn marched alongside Edie Windsor, the New Yorker whose U.S. Supreme Court case paved the way for gay couples to receive federal benefits this year, leading more than 1,000 backers.

Quinn's campaign said it planned targeted advertisements on Facebook asking women to "Make history with Chris Quinn," and targeting women voters through house parties and phone banks.

Mike Morey, Quinn's spokesman, noted that she had fought to save education jobs, keep firehouses open and expand access to pre-kindergarten during difficult fiscal times.

"She will continue making the case through Election Day that she is the only candidate who has a real record of results delivering for the middle class," Morey said.

Back at the Cubbyhole, as a performer clad in black leather shorts and a red wig danced in the background, Jaimie Ho, 35, a structural engineer, said she was not sold on Quinn.

Ho remembered seeing Quinn at the pride parade: "She didn't seem accessible. She had a ton of body guards around her."

"I like her background. I like the work she has done in the City Council," continued Ho. "But I ask myself: Is it fair to vote for her simply because she is gay? There needs to be more substance."



headline: White House holds high-level meeting over security threat
byline: By Jeff Mason
8:31am EDT

President Barack Obama's top national security advisers met at the White House on Saturday to discuss the potential threat of terrorist attacks that caused Washington and its allies to issue travel warnings and close embassies throughout the Middle East.

The United States issued a worldwide travel alert on Friday warning Americans that al Qaeda may be planning attacks in August, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa.

Without giving an update on the nature of the threat, the White House said top officials including Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, and national security adviser Susan Rice gathered on Saturday to discuss it.

"Early this week, the president instructed his National Security team to take all appropriate steps to protect the American people in light of a potential threat occurring in or emanating from the Arabian Peninsula," the White House said in a statement.

"This afternoon, National Security Advisor Rice chaired a meeting with the Principals Committee to further review the situation and follow-up actions," it said, referring to the group of advisers.

A senior U.S. official, asked if the United States had pre-positioned forces to deal with the latest threat, replied, "We've had U.S. forces prepared for some time to respond to potential contingencies in the Middle East and North Africa.

"We're postured to support timely and effective action if requested. This latest threat is serious, and the Pentagon is working closely with its partners, to include the State Department and the intelligence community, to confront it," the official said on condition of anonymity.

Obama is spending the weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat after playing golf earlier on Saturday. His birthday is Sunday.

The White House said Obama had received regular briefings about the potential threat and U.S. preparedness measures all week. Rice and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco briefed him after the high-level meeting on Saturday, it said.

Other attendees at the White House meeting included Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and the heads of the FBI and CIA.

The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that American embassies that would normally be open this Sunday - including those in Abu Dhabi, Baghdad and Cairo - would be closed.

CBS News reported that intelligence officials had information about a major plot.

"Intelligence officers have reporting from a reliable source that a major plot is under way and that the team to carry it out has been selected and is in place," CBS reported. U.S. authorities did not know the date, the timing or the target of the planned attack, it said.

France said earlier on Saturday it would close its embassy in Yemen for several days from Sunday, following similar moves by Britain and Germany.



headline: U.S. expected to say accused Fort Hood shooter carefully planned attack
byline: By Lisa Maria Garza
8:31am EDT

combat attack in history on a U.S. military base, killing 13 unarmed soldiers in 2009, military officials said.

After nearly four years of legal delays, prosecutors will lay out their case against Hasan in opening statements at his military court martial on the base where he is accused of the attack on November 5, 2009.

Hasan, 42, an American-born Muslim, is charged with killing 13 soldiers and injuring 32 civilian workers in the rampage, only days before he was scheduled to be deployed to Afghanistan.

A military jury of nine colonels, three lieutenant colonels and one major will consider evidence in the case.

Hasan was shot and critically wounded to end the massacre. He is confined to a wheel chair.

He admitted at an earlier court hearing that his actions were taken to protect Muslims and the Taliban in Afghanistan from U.S. assaults. The base near Killeen, Texas, is a major center for soldiers deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.

Hasan, a former Army psychiatrist, will represent himself at the court martial and faces the death penalty if convicted.

Military judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, has rejected Hasan's offer to plead guilty in return for being spared the death penalty. A unanimous verdict of guilty is required for execution to be an option. The last execution carried out by the U.S. military was in 1961.

The long delay is unusual, said Lisa Marie Windsor, a 22-year veteran of the Judge Advocate General Corps who has been involved in more than 75 military cases.

"This case has certainly been through the wringer and unfortunately at the detriment of the victims, who want some closure," Windsor said.

At a pre-trial hearing on Friday, Hasan said he plans to call only two witnesses, according to Fort Hood officials. The witnesses were not identified.

Hasan will be allowed to cross-examine any witness during the trial, including shooting victims and former Fort Hood police sergeant Mark Todd, who shot him to end the rampage.

In a ruling on Friday, Osborn allowed prosecutors to present evidence that Hasan was on the Internet in the days - and even hours - before the attack, searching terms such as "Taliban" and "jihad" - which some radical Islamists define as a holy war.

Prosecutors also have asked to introduce Hasan's academic papers written during his master's program at Walter Reed Medical Center, in which he defended suicide bombing. Osborn deferred a decision on that request.

From the Texas county jail where he is being held, Hasan has in recent days twice issued statements to Fox News. He joined in a request by Fox News on Friday for permission to have an on-camera interview. Osborn denied the motion, saying the decision is outside the court's jurisdiction, according to Fort Hood officials.

In one of his statements to Fox, Hasan apologized for having served in the U.S. military, which he said is waging war on the Muslim religion. Last week, in another statement he declared his intention to renounce his U.S. citizenship.

The statement renouncing his citizenship has no legal standing, officials said.

One man lost part of his leg and at least two other people were injured by flying debris as they watched the planned implosion of an abandoned power plant in Bakersfield, California early on Saturday morning, police said.

The 43-year-old "suffered a traumatic partial amputation of one leg and major injuries to the other," the Bakersfield Police Department said in a statement. Shrapnel from the blast also hit two other spectators, causing minor injuries, the release said.

One officer along the east perimeter heard screams for help at the 6 a.m. implosion, said police, who were on scene helping to control traffic and crowds.

The boiler facility, which belonged to Pacific Gas and Electric Company and was decommissioned in 1986, had two towers 140 feet tall and four 200,000-gallon (757â&euro;&permil;,082-liter) empty water tanks, company spokesman Denny Boyles said.

It was being removed so the property could be cleared for sale under an agreement with the city of Bakersfield, he said.

Demolition subcontractors worked with police to establish a 1,000-foot (305-meter) perimeter beyond which a crowd had gathered to observe the demolition, Boyles said. He said the injured people were apparently outside the perimeter.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured during the demolition," Boyles said, adding that the company and subcontractors are cooperating with local authorities investigating what went wrong.

The man with the leg injuries was taken to a local hospital and then to Fresno, California, for further treatment, police said.



headline: NRA opens Midwest museum showing nearly 1,000 firearms

The National Rifle Association has opened an elaborate museum in the American Midwest, displaying nearly 1,000 firearms, including those used by French Emperor Napoleon and Hollywood cowboy star John Wayne, along with subtle reminders of the campaign for the right to gun ownership.

The NRA National Sporting Arms Museum opened on Friday at a sprawling Bass Pro Shops outdoor retail store in Springfield, Missouri, a politically conservative central U.S. city that is a gateway to the mountainous Ozarks region popular with tourist and hunters.

Admission is free to the 7,500-square-foot (697-square-metres) museum, which has detailed dioramas and displays that were a decade in the planning stages, said NRA officials.

"If you are a gun person, you are going to love this place," museum director Jim Supica says in an online video promoting the museum as "one of the premier firearms museums in the world."

"These guns came from the NRA collection built over 80 years, but a lot came from special collections that haven't had a place for display," Supica told Reuters in a telephone interview.

The museum is opening as divisions over gun control have widened after the massacre of elementary school children in Newtown, Connecticut in December. President Barack Obama has been rebuffed by Congress in his efforts to tighten gun laws, and the NRA has staunchly opposed gun control.

Prominently featured in the museum are firearms used by historical figures - an engraved shotgun presented by Napoleon Bonaparte to a general in his army, guns from Missouri-born Old West outlaw Jesse James and weapons used in Western movies by tough-guy actors John Wayne and Clint Eastwood.

One of the dioramas shows President Theodore Roosevelt, an outdoor enthusiast and avid hunter, on safari. Another depicts explorers Lewis and Clark, who mapped the vast Louisiana purchase, from St. Louis to the Pacific Coast, in the early 1800s.

The museum incorporates reminders of the NRA mission - to defend the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution setting out the right to bear arms. One of the galleries, named "Second Amendment" includes a copy of the wording in the amendment, Supica said.

Marketing materials touting the museum say it "illustrates themes of hunting, conservation and freedom."

But the museum is "not political," Supica said. It traces the history of guns in America, from the Revolution against British rule in the 18th century.

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, whose aim is to "enact and enforce sensible gun laws," did not respond to a call and email for comment about the museum.

Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris, who started the hunting and fishing gear business in the early 1970s by making fishing lures, proposed the Missouri location after visiting the NRA's National Firearms Museum in Fairfax, Virginia.

The Bass Pro store in Springfield has about four million visitors annually and is one of the state's top tourist destinations, said Tammy Sapp, Bass Pro spokeswoman.

Like other Bass Pro Shops around the country, the Springfield store has fish and wildlife displays that recreate natural habitats, as well as stuffed and mounted wildlife. Springfield is the privately held retail chain's flagship store.

Julius Chambers, a North Carolina attorney who helped to shape U.S. civil rights law, died aged 76 on Friday after battling declining health, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Legal Defense Fund said in a statement.

Chambers and his partners argued landmark civil rights cases related to de-segregation and voting rights before the United States Supreme Court, according to the NAACP.

They included Swann v. the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education in 1971, which led to cross-town student bus transit that helped to integrate local schools.

"He was a man of tremendous courage," the NAACP said in a statement.

His firm, founded in 1964, was the first racially integrated law practice in the southern U.S. state, according to the Charlotte Observer.

"He believed that regardless of one's position, status, race, creed, color, religion or gender, everyone has an obligation to ensure equality for all," Attorney James Ferguson, a partner at Chambers' firm, told a news conference on Saturday.

Chambers graduated first in his class at the University of North Carolina School of Law and was the first African-American editor-in-chief of its law review, according to the NAACP.

In the mid-1980s, he became president and chair of the board of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, a position he held for nine years, and in 1993 he was made Chancellor at his college alma mater, North Carolina Central University, the NAACP said.

His wife, Vivian, died last year, and he had two children, according to the NAACP.

The 43-year-old "suffered a traumatic partial amputation of one leg and major injuries to the other," the Bakersfield Police Department said in a statement.

Shrapnel from the blast also hit four other spectators, causing minor injuries, said Kern County Fire Department fire engineer Leland Davis, adding there were at least 1,000 onlookers.

Police said only two other spectators were injured and had not revised their tally.

One officer along the east perimeter heard screams for help at the 6 a.m. implosion, said police, who were on scene helping to control traffic and crowds.

headline: Northern California city sues Chevron over refinery fire
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

The Northern California city of Richmond on Friday sued Chevron Corp, saying the company was willfully negligent in a massive refinery fire and a smoke cloud last year that sent thousands of people to hospitals.

Richmond city officials filed the lawsuit in Contra Costa Superior Court seeking unspecified damages.

Health workers, environmental and community groups planned to rally in Richmond on Saturday in advance of the one-year anniversary of the August 6 fire. The fire, which was started by a pipeline rupture, knocked out the refinery until April.

"The lawsuit seeks damages for the harm caused to the city of Richmond and its community but more importantly is designed to make sure that Chevron changes its corporate culture and makes sure the same thing doesn't happen again," said Frank Pitre, one of the lawyers representing the city in the lawsuit.

The 39-page complaint alleges Chevron "sacrificed safety over profits" and ignored repeated warnings of the risks of pipe corrosions and delayed repairs and inspections.

It also stated that the fire was not unavoidable and followed a dozen similar incidents at Chevron in two decades.

A representative for Chevron did not return a call or email.

In April, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board found fault with California's regulatory system, which it said needed stricter requirements in order to prevent accidents and enforce safety at high-hazard industrial plants such as Chevron's Richmond site.

The blaze sent a fireball skyward and a plume of smoke into the air that lingered above Richmond and neighboring cities for days. At least 15,000 people went to hospitals with respiratory complaints in the hours and days after the fire.

By January, Chevron said it had paid $10 million in claims connected to the blaze, with over 23,300 claims made, according to a letter from Chevron to a local health department.

Pitre said the city waited a year to sue Chevron because it first attempted to negotiate with the company. Richmond City Councilman Tom Butt said the city met with Chevron representatives three times before deciding to sue.



headline: Florida lawmakers agree to hearings on 'Stand Your Ground' law

defense law, which has become a lightning rod for criticism following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.

The announcement on Friday by Will Weatherford, the speaker of Florida's House of Representatives, marked the biggest concession yet by the state's Republican leaders to protesters' demands for a top-to-bottom review of the law, which allows people in fear of serious injury to use deadly force to defend themselves rather than retreat.

Since Zimmerman's acquittal on July 13, Martin's grieving parents, backed by African-American civic leaders, celebrities, students and political figures, including President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, have all said the Stand Your Ground law needs to be re-examined.

Weatherford, in an opinion column published in the Tampa Tribune, said he had asked Representative Matt Gaetz, a fellow Republican who chairs the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee, to lead the hearings. Weatherford did not set a date for the hearings or say how long they would last.

"Across Florida, representatives are receiving calls, letters, visits and emails from constituents with diverse opinions on 'Stand Your Ground,'" Weatherford said. "Passions are high, but every person has the right to express their views on this matter of great importance."

in outside Governor Rick Scott's office in a bid to change the law. "We're excited about having an open debate," he told Reuters.

Advocates of the law, the first of its kind in the country and now copied in more than 20 other states, say violent crime has fallen since it was enacted.

But critics see the self-defense law as emblematic of racial bias and unequal justice in America, since some studies have shown that defense claims made under the law are far more likely to be successful when the victim is black.

Two of the six jurors in the Zimmerman case have said the Stand Your Ground law left them with no option but to acquit him.

"Our evaluation of its (the law's) effectiveness should be guided by objective information, not by political expediency," Weatherford wrote.

"Does the law keep the innocent safer? Is it being applied fairly? Are there ways we can make this law clearer and more understandable?" he asked.

Most U.S. voters support the "Stand Your Ground" laws, although the question of whether to retreat or use deadly force in self defense divides Americans along gender, racial and political lines, a national Quinnipiac University poll found on Friday.

The poll found that a strong majority of white voters and men support the laws, while black voters generally oppose them and women are almost evenly divided.



headline: New Jersey Governor Christie nudged by gun rights group in key primary state
byline: By David Jones
8:31am EDT

rights group in the bellwether presidential primary state of New Hampshire has warned New Jersey Governor Chris Christie that signing gun control bills passed by his state's Legislature could have consequences if he runs for president in 2016.

The Pro-Gun New Hampshire coalition urged its members this week to call and email Christie to ask him to veto the proposed laws, posing a political dilemma for Christie as he seeks re-election in November in the Democratic-leaning state while also eyeing the national stage.

Christie has a September deadline to sign a number of firearm-related bills seen by their supporters as necessary for tackling gun violence, and the gun rights group is targeting four of those measures.

One bill would ban .50 caliber rifles, another would require police to report lost and stolen firearms to a federal database, a third would create a system for instant background checks during gun purchases and a fourth bill would ban gun sales to anyone on a watch list of militants.

"This is an acid test," said Sam Cohen, executive vice president of Pro-Gun New Hampshire, which describes itself as the state's largest gun rights group.

"If he decides to support these horrible bills, then we in New Hampshire are going to do everything we can to tell our voters not to vote for him in the New Hampshire primary," Cohen said.

Christie, a rising star in the Republican Party who rejected appeals from fellow Republicans to run for president in 2012, said in a television interview in January that he would be "more ready" to campaign for the White House in 2016 after finishing his work as the governor of New Jersey.

New Hampshire, which has played a significant role in past elections by holding the nation's first presidential primary, is known to have a strong libertarian streak. The state allows nearly every resident to obtain a concealed weapons permit unless he or she is a convicted felon.

A spokesman for Christie did not return calls.

Brigid Harrison, a professor of political science at Montclair State University in New Jersey said Christie had been careful about tipping his hand on gun control, because he is running for re-election in heavily Democratic New Jersey but understands the pro-gun values of anticipated Republican primary voters in the 2016 race.

"What we've seen is him walk a fine line by delaying decision-making," Harrison said.

State Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in this month's special election to replace the late Frank Lautenberg, said Christie had been carefully weighing his political future with regard to his position on gun control.

"Yes, he is going to pay attention to the threats that are being issued by the gun rights groups," she said.

Oliver added that severe gun violence in New Jersey cities like Newark, Trenton, Camden and other urban areas made gun control a serious issue in the state.

"If he could take politics out of the equation, I do believe Governor Christie would sign some of those bills," she said.

Christie in June vetoed a bill that would ban state pension fund investments in firms that sell or make assault weapons.



headline: Murder charges dropped against Indiana woman who ate poison while pregnant

Indiana prosecutors dropped murder and attempted feticide charges on Friday against an Indianapolis woman who tried to commit suicide by eating rat poison near the end of her pregnancy.

Bei Bei Shuai, 36, was charged in March 2011 with knowingly killing a viable fetus, prosecutors said.

Shuai walked out of Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis a free woman on Friday after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal recklessness for the death of her daughter, Angel. She had been released from prison on bond in May 2012. Under the plea agreement, she did not have to serve more jail time.

"I have to say thank you to everyone who supported me before because without them, I'm not going to be able to continue to today," Shuai told reporters in footage posted on the Indianapolis Star website.

Shuai consumed rat poison while 33 weeks' pregnant in December 2010, prosecutors said. She was taken to a hospital where she admitted to attempting to kill herself after her boyfriend left her, according to a police statement.

Shuai's baby girl, Angel Shuai, was born alive, but died a few days after being taken off life support.

Shuai is from China and has no family members in the United States, according to her lawyer, Linda Pence.

Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said his office had always been willing to resolve the case for lesser charges. Earlier proposed deals had been rejected by the defense.

Curry said decisions by the trial judge about what could and could not be entered into evidence at the trial played a role in the negotiations.



headline: NSA revelations could hurt collaboration with 'betrayed' hackers
byline: By Joseph Menn
8:31am EDT

The U.S. government's efforts to recruit talented hackers could suffer from the recent revelations about its vast domestic surveillance programs, as many private researchers express disillusionment with the National Security Agency.

Though hackers tend to be anti-establishment by nature, the NSA and other intelligence agencies had made major inroads in recent years in hiring some of the best and brightest, and paying for information on software flaws that help them gain access to target computers and phones.

Much of that goodwill has been erased after the NSA's classified programs to monitor phone records and Internet activity were exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, according to prominent hackers and cyber experts.

A turn in the community's sentiment was on show at two major security conventions in Las Vegas this week: Black Hat, which attracts more established cyber professionals, and Def Con, which gets a larger gathering of younger, more independent hackers.

"We've gone backwards about 10 years in the relations between the good guys and the U.S. government," said Alex Stamos, a veteran security researcher who was to give a Def Con talk on Saturday on the need to revisit industry ethics.

Stamos has willingly briefed FBI and NSA officials on his work in the past, but said that he would now want their questions in writing and he would bring a lawyer to any meeting.

With top intelligence officials warning in March that cyber attacks and cyber espionage have supplanted terrorism as the top security threat facing the United States, the administration is trying to boost security in critical infrastructure and the military is vastly increasing its ranks of computer specialists.

The NSA, working with the Department of Homeland Security, has been lending more of its expertise to protect defense contractors, banks, utilities and other industries that are being spied upon or attacked by rival nations.

These efforts rely on recruiting talented hackers and working with professionals in the private sector.

Some security experts remain supportive of the government. NSA Director Keith Alexander's talk at the Black Hat conference was well received on Wednesday, despite a few hecklers.

But at the larger and less expensive Def Con, where attendance is expected to top last year's 15,000, conference founder and government advisor Jeff Moss asked federal agents to stay away.

Moss last year brought Alexander as a keynote speaker to woo the hacking community. But he said the relationship between hackers and the government has worsened since then.

"I haven't seen this level or sort of animosity since the 90s," Moss said in an interview. "If you aren't going to say anything in these circumstances, then you never are."

VILLAIN OR HERO

The NSA's surveillance programs target foreigners outside the United States who pose potential threats to U.S. security or who can provide intelligence for foreign policies. But the secret projects also scooped up huge amounts of American data, according to documents leaked by Snowden, triggering sharp criticism from many lawmakers and civil liberties advocates.

"A lot of people feel betrayed by it," said HD Moore, an executive at security firm Rapid 7, though he said he would continue to brief the NSA on software flaws that the agency uses for both offensive and defensive cyber activities. "What bothers me is the hypocritical bit - we demonize China when we've been doing these things and probably worse."

Alexander took a conciliatory tone during his Black Hat speech, defending the NSA but saying he looked forward to a discussion about how it could do things better.

Black Hat attracts professionals whose companies pay thousands of dollars for them to attend. Def Con costs $180 and features many of the same speakers.

At Black Hat, a casual polling station at a vendor's exhibition booth asking whether Snowden was a villain or a hero produced a dead heat: 138 to 138. European attendees were especially prone to vote for hero, the vendor said.

Def Con would have been much rougher on Alexander, judging by interviews there and the reception given speakers who touched on Snowden and other government topics.

Christopher Soghoian, an American Civil Liberties Union technologist, drew applause from hundreds of attendees when he said the ACLU had been the first to sue the NSA after one of the spy programs was revealed.

Peiter Zatko, a hacker hero who funded many small projects from a just-departed post at the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, told another large audience that he was unhappy with the surveillance programs and that "challenging the government is your patriotic duty."

The disenchanted give multiple reasons, citing previous misleading statements about domestic surveillance, the government's efforts to force companies to decrypt user communications, and the harm to U.S. businesses overseas.

"I don't think anyone should believe anything they tell us," former NSA hacker Charlie Miller said of top intelligence officials. "I wouldn't work there anymore."

Stamos and Moss said the U.S. government is tilting too much toward offense in cyberspace, using secret vulnerabilities that their targets can then discover and wield against others.

Closest to home for many hackers are the government's aggressive prosecutions under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which has been used against Internet activist Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide in January, and U.S. soldier Bradley Manning, who leaked classified files to anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.

A letter circulating at Def Con and signed by some of the most prominent academics in computer security said the law was chilling research in the public interest by allowing prosecutors and victim companies to argue that violations of electronic "terms of service" constitute unauthorized intrusions.

Researchers who have found important flaws in electronic voting machines and medical devices did so without authorization, the letter says.

If there is any silver lining, Moss said, it is that before Snowden's leaks, it had been impossible to have an informed discussion about how to balance security and civil liberties without real knowledge of government practices.

"The debate is just starting," he said. "Maybe we can be a template for other democracies."



headline: Cleveland abductor moved to state prison for evaluation

The Cleveland bus driver sentenced to life in prison for abducting three women and repeatedly raping them over a decade has been moved to an Ohio state prison for evaluation, a county spokesman said on Saturday.

Ariel Castro, 53, was taken on Friday from a jail in Cleveland to the Lorain Correctional Institution in Grafton, Ohio, according to Cuyahoga County spokesman, John O'Brien.

Castro will undergo a mental and physical evaluation before being placed permanently in a facility, O'Brien said.

Castro was sentenced on Thursday to life in prison without parole, plus 1,000 years. He had pleaded guilty to hundreds of charges, including murder under a fetal homicide law after beating and starving one his victims, Michelle Knight, to force her to miscarry.

While Castro apologized to the women at his sentencing on Thursday, he was mostly defiant. He argued with the judge and made several bizarre comments.

"I am not a monster," Castro said during a rambling, 16-minute statement in court.

Castro said the women were not virgins when he abducted them and sex was consensual. A 6-year-old girl fathered by Castro with one of the captive women, had a "normal" life, he said, and there was "a lot of harmony" in the house where he kept the women imprisoned.

Castro told the judge he was not a violent person, despite pleading guilty to beating and binding the women with chains and ropes. He said that a history of violence against his former common law wife was because she would not "quiet down."

security facility based on his crimes and his lack of a previous criminal record.

"He will go through psychological testing and they will look at his education and prior convictions and give him a score," Benza said.

Castro abducted the women and held them for between 9 and 11 years, along with the 6-year-old girl, born in captivity.

Knight told him during a dramatic courtroom appearance that he had put her through 11 years of hell. She returned on Friday to the neighborhood where she was held captive and looked at the house, although she did not go inside.

The women were rescued on May 6 when neighbors heard one of the victims crying for help. Police and neighbors rescued all three from the fortress-like home, where there were locks on the outside of doors to several rooms, heavy curtains separating parts of the house, windows boarded up from the inside and more than 90 feet of chain.



headline: Restaurant chain says salad linked to virus no longer served
byline: By Noreen O'Donnell
8:31am EDT

A salad mix linked to a severe stomach virus that sickened more than 200 people in Iowa and Nebraska has not been served at Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants there for about a month, a spokesman for the restaurants said on Saturday.

The Food and Drug Administration identified the salad, supplied by a Mexican farm, as responsible for the cyclospora outbreak in those two states.

But the FDA said it is not yet clear if it was the culprit in 14 other states as well, and the investigation will continue.

Rich Jeffers, a spokesman for Orlando, Florida-based Darden Restaurants, which operates Olive Garden and Red Lobster, said it has been more than a month since the last case was reported in Iowa and Nebraska. The shelf life of the salad is about two-weeks.

"We are fully confident along with health officials that in those states the product is out of the supply chain," Jeffers said.

The cyclospora infections account for more than 400 cases of illness in 16 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least 22 people have been hospitalized.

The highest number of cases - 146 - were reported in Iowa, followed by Texas with 113, Nebraska with 81 and Florida with 25, according to the CDC. Other states have reported cases in the single digits.

Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants in Texas, the state with the second largest number of reported illnesses, are not supplied by Taylor Farms de Mexico, Jeffers said.

The majority of cases were reported between mid-June and early July, the CDC said.

"None of Taylor Farms' other 11 facilities have been connected to these cases," a statement on its Web site said.

The FDA also said its investigation has not found any problems with bagged salad mix found in grocery stores.

The states reporting cases of stomach illness are: Iowa, Nebraska, Texas, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio.

Cyclosporiasis is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Symptoms for the illness, caused by ingesting contaminated food or water containing a parasite too small to be detected without a microscope, include nausea, watery diarrhea and body aches.

Most people with healthy immune systems recover from the infection without treatment, but the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are believed to be at higher risk for prolonged illness.



headline: Doctor prescribes healthcare cost savings plans to governors
byline: By Brendan O'Brien
8:31am EDT

Home nursing and social work can significantly drive down healthcare costs caused by overuse of hospitals and nursing homes, a family doctor who practices in one of the poorest U.S. cities told a group of governors on Friday.

Jeffrey Brenner, the founder of Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers, encouraged governors attending the National Governors Association summer meeting in Milwaukee to work with healthcare providers in their state to consolidate and de-institutionalize their systems.

"You regulate these facilities and you regulate the providers. Everyone that needs to be here to fix the American healthcare system is right here in this room," said Brenner, who works in Camden, New Jersey, where 40 percent of the population lives in poverty.

Brenner made his remarks during the opening session of the three-day event, attended by 23 state governors and the governors from Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

The governors are participating in presentations and discussions regarding economic development and commerce, natural resources, military veterans and cybersecurity.

Brenner's organization found that a large part of healthcare spending happens in large facilities such as hospitals, nursing homes and hospice facilities, where costs tend to be higher.

Brenner cited a Pennsylvania study that found community-based nursing of elderly patients over a 10-year period decreased hospitalization by a third, Medicare costs by a fifth and risk of death by a fourth.

"You have to go way back in medical history to find anything with that kind of impact," he said. "This is a stunning impact."

Brenner recommended creation of systems in which nurses and social workers work in the field to help the chronically sick navigate the complex healthcare system. This approach, he said, will ultimately decrease the number of expensive hospital visits.

One of the biggest challenges governors have is to "overcome the tremendous amount of money and clout and connections (hospitals) have," said Iowa Governor Terry Branstad.

Branstad said Brenner's remarks resonated with him after a tough legislative session in which hospital association "threw everything they had" at the state's effort to come up with a healthcare plan.

The United States spends $2.8 trillion, twice as much as every other country, on healthcare each year, representing 18 percent of the country's total economy, Brenner said.

"We have to re-invest this money on the front line of care, rather than building more hospitals, expanding emergency rooms and buying more scanners," Brenner said. "The problem in America, we set a very high price to cut, scan, zap and hospitalize and set a very low price if you talk to people."



headline: U.S. judge denies class certification sought by women suing Wal-Mart
byline: By Casey Sullivan and Dan Levine
8:31am EDT

Mart, a U.S. judge in San Francisco on Friday rejected an attempt to bring reformulated sex discrimination claims against the company as a class action.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer denied a motion for class certification brought by plaintiffs seeking to represent 150,000 women in Wal-Mart's California offices who alleged the world's largest retailer denied them pay raises and promotions because of their gender.

The claims were filed as a reformulated lawsuit after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a larger class-action sex discrimination against Wal-Mart Stores Inc in 2011 that claimed female employees at 3,400 Walmart stores nationwide were underpaid and given fewer promotions.

The California lawsuit was part of a broader strategy by women Wal-Mart workers to bring more narrowly tailored class actions in an attempt to seek damages, targeting Wal-Mart's employment practices in regions throughout the country.

Instead of relying on nationwide statistical patterns and anecdotal evidence provided by plaintiffs, the California lawsuit had alleged specific discriminatory statements made by the district and regional managers that have decision-making authority over pay and promotions.

Breyer said in his ruling that the women could not bring their allegations as a class action because they had not established that their claims of the company's employment practice were linked to a class-wide policy.

But he said: "This order does not consider whether plaintiffs themselves were victims of discrimination as alleged in their complaint; those individual claims shall proceed in this litigation."

Still, Breyer took issue with some of the merits of the plaintiffs case. For one, he said that the women did not identify statistically significant disparities in pay and promotion decisions throughout the California regions at issue.

Breyer also noted that the women said they had anecdotes reflecting stereotyped views expressed by a number of regional managers, but only offered evidence of bias exhibited by about five percent of the top level management that they say guided lower-level decisions.

"Though plaintiffs succeeded in illustrating attitudes of gender bias held by managers at Wal-Mart, they failed to marshal significant proof that intentional discrimination was a general policy affecting the entire class," Breyer said.

A Wal-Mart spokesman said in a statement that the company has had a strong policy against discrimination in place for many years, and that the allegations from the plaintiffs were not representative of the positive experiences of other women working at Wal-Mart.

"Judge Breyer gave the plaintiffs every opportunity to offer any evidence they wanted, and their evidence comes up short," said Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer representing Wal-Mart. "We are gratified."

Randy Renick, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that plaintiffs were "deeply disappointed" with the court's decision and intended to appeal the ruling.

"While this court decision does not in any way negate the merits of the pay and promotion discrimination case against Wal-Mart, it does create yet another hurdle for these women to at long last have their day in court," he said.



headline: Firefighter killed in Oregon is identified as crews battle blazes

A firefighter killed while battling a central Oregon wildfire has been identified as John Hammack of Madras, Oregon, officials said on Friday, as crews aided briefly by cooler, wetter weather grappled with blazes that have blackened more than 200 square miles (520 square km) of the Pacific Northwest.

Hammack died and another firefighter was injured when the top of a tree they were removing from the fire area outside the town of Sisters on Thursday broke off and crashed down on Hammack, who was 58, the Deschutes County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

Other officials said Hammack was 60.

The surviving firefighter, Norman Crawford, was treated at a hospital for shoulder injuries and has been released, according to local reports. Both men, contract tree fellers, were part of a firefighting team.

"This is a tough loss for Oregon," said Governor John Kitzhaber, who is set to visit a fire area in the southern part of the West Coast state on Saturday.

The current fire season has been particularly deadly in the U.S. West. Nineteen Arizona firefighters died in June after they became trapped by a wind-whipped inferno, and two people perished after being caught in a blaze in Colorado.

Thousands of firefighters fought to snuff out or at least contain blazes that had burned more than 40,000 acres of timber and range land across Oregon on Friday, 5,000 acres more than on Thursday, said Carol Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center.

Nighttime and early morning lightning strikes sparked dozens of new fires, Connelly said, adding that emergency crews were helped by cooler temperatures and higher humidity, a streak likely to end next week with hotter weather and possibly more lightning-bearing storms.

In neighboring Washington state, more than 2,100 firefighters were making steady progress against a pair of blazes that have scorched more than 107,000 acres east of the Cascade Range.

About 45 structures remained at high risk from the so-called Colockum Tarps fire burning south of Wenatchee, said Mary Ellen Fitzgerald, a U.S. Forest Service official and a spokeswoman for firefighting efforts.

That fire, which has burned more than 80,000 acres in less than a week, has claimed three houses and five other buildings, including three outhouses. It was 30 percent contained as of Friday morning as firefighters were aided by light rain and fortuitous winds pushing smoke away from the containment line, Fitzgerald said.

Farther south, the so-called Mile Marker 28 fire, which has blackened 27,000 acres close to the Oregon border, is 75 percent contained, with residents of 69 homes forced to flee allowed to return as of Wednesday.

time psychology professor recently revealed to have shot and killed his father, mother and teenage sister in Texas more than four decades ago, although he was found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Millikin University, a Presbyterian school in Decatur with 2,380 students, said in a statement that the school expects James St. James, 61, to keep teaching at Millikin this fall.

The school said it "has only recently been made aware of Dr. St. James' past. Given the traumatic experiences of his childhood, Dr. St. James' efforts to rebuild his life and obtain a successful professional career have been remarkable."

St. James, originally James Wolcott, spent six years in a mental institution after the killings but emerged to start a new life, changing his name and getting master's and doctoral degrees in psychology, according to the Georgetown Advocate newspaper.

Georgetown is the Austin suburb where the killings took place in 1967. Reporters for the paper wondered what had happened to Wolcott and traced him to Millikin.

St. James could not be reached for comment Friday.

The news sent a shock wave through Decatur, with city council member Jerry J. Dawson, a former Macon County sheriff, saying that St. James should have told the school about his past before joining the faculty.

"I look at this from a law enforcement perspective, and I just have a problem with somebody who didn't disclose this information," Dawson said. "If I were a parent and my kids were going to Millikin, that's something I would want to know."

In its statement, the university said that St. James had over 27 years "taught a variety of courses at Millikin, served in various leadership roles and built a successful academic career, receiving academic awards including the 1997 Teaching Excellence and Leadership Award."

The Georgetown Advocate said St. James' father was Gordon Wolcott, chairman of the biology department of a local university. The newspaper said James Wolcott had admitted to sniffing some airplane glue on the night of August 4, 1967, and then killing his family with a .22-caliber rifle.

headline: CBS, Time Warner Cable fight escalates; network dark in NY, LA
byline: By Lisa Richwine and Liana B. Baker
8:31am EDT

U.S. broadcaster CBS went dark for millions of Time Warner Cable subscribers on Friday in the nation's two largest markets and other cities after the cable operator and CBS Corp failed to reach an agreement over fees following weeks of contentious negotiations.

The blackout by Time Warner Cable of the No. 1-rated U.S. broadcast network followed an increasingly hostile and public battle between the two sides, which accused each other of making unreasonable demands in their talks over how much the cable operator will pay to carry CBS.

CBS hit back by suspending videos of full episodes on CBS.com for customers with Internet access provided by Time Warner Cable in the affected markets.

The network, home to hits such as "The Big Bang Theory" and "NCIS," is seen by an estimated 3.5 million customers in the affected markets, including the two biggest, New York and Los Angeles, and Dallas.

A source familiar with CBS' negotiating strategy said the company had offered to extend current terms and keep negotiating in the coming days. No new talks between the sides are scheduled, said the source who asked to be anonymous because the talks are private.

Time Warner Cable spokeswoman Maureen Huff said the operator offered a one-year extension before it blacked out the channels.

The companies issued dueling statements on Friday as Time Warner Cable began dropping CBS and its cable networks, including Showtime, from the company's systems in those markets.

The cable operator said it had agreed to extend talks until Tuesday morning but that CBS "refused to have a productive discussion."

"It's become clear that no matter how much time we give them, they're not willing to come to reasonable terms," said Huff. The company thanked customers for patience "as we continue to fight hard to keep prices down."

CBS shot back that Time Warner Cable "conducted negotiations in a combative and non-productive spirit, indulging in pointless brinkmanship and distorted public positioning."

The network "is eager to make an agreement in line with the kind it has struck with every other cable, satellite and telco provider, and has continually sought reasonable term extensions to get that job done," CBS said.

RETRANSMISSION FEES

The threat of blackouts has become increasingly common as networks, which provide programming, square off against cable operators that pay "retransmission fees" to transmit those programs into living rooms around the country.

The battle with CBS, one of the industry's toughest negotiators, represented a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go dark and fight (retransmission) fees," BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said. "Time Warner had to do it," he said.

CBS is seeking a monthly fee of $2 per subscriber, said RBC Capital Markets analyst David Bank, up from about $1 currently.

"Compared to others who get $1 per (subscriber)," they've (CBS) spent four to eight times as much on content," Bank said. "We think they'll prevail."

The loss of advertising dollars is relatively less painful during the summer, when networks air mostly reruns and audience numbers drop. This weekend, viewers will miss the Bridgestone Invitational golf tournament, currently led by Tiger Woods. Later this week, they could lose out on sci-fi hit "Under the Dome" and reality show "Big Brother."

If the blackout persists into August, CBS could lose audiences in the some of the largest U.S. markets for reliably popular National Football League games.

In a message to customers, Time Warner Cable said it would temporarily offer programming from Starz Kids and Family as a replacement for CBS.

It added it would provide credits on upcoming bills for subscribers to Showtime or the TMC movie channel.

The blackout was the latest set of negotiations between a broadcaster and a cable or satellite operator to break down, leaving subscribers of those services without their favorite programs.

Last summer, satellite operator DirecTV's 20 million customers were unable to see more than 20 of Viacom's cable networks, including Nickelodeon and MTV, for 10 days after those companies failed to strike a new deal.

Fox went dark for more than 3 million Cablevision customers in 2010. The two settled on October 31, 2010, restoring service for three Fox-owned TV stations, Fox Business Network, the National Geographic and other channels.

Cablevision blamed the 15-day blackout, which deprived its customers of most of the World Series, for the loss of many of the 35,000 subscribers who gave up their cable subscriptions during that quarter.

The CBS blackout caps weeks of aggressive marketing staged by both companies to get the public on their side. In TV commercials airing in the markets involved in the dispute, Time Warner Cable accused CBS of giving New York a "black eye," while CBS urged viewers in its own spot to "say no to Time Warner Cable," and gave them Time Warner Cable's phone number.

On Friday evening, CBS took its messages to billboards in New York's Times Square that urged customers to call Time Warner to "tell them you want what you paid for."

CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves, a former actor who played the heavy in crime shows like "Cannon," is one of the industry's toughest negotiators. He told analysts during a May 1 earnings call that CBS intended to generate $1 billion annually in retransmission fees from cable and satellite companies by 2017, "if not before."

Dr. William Petit, whose wife and daughters were murdered in a 2007 home invasion, has announced he and his new wife are expecting a baby in December, according to local media reports.

News from Petit, 56, that his wife Christine, 36, is pregnant comes several days before the couple's first wedding anniversary on August 5. Petit told the Hartford Courant and WFSB-TV on Thursday that the baby is due on December 3.

The former Christine Paluf, 36, a professional photographer, met Petit while volunteering for the Petit Family Foundation, a charity he created in memory of his wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.

The wife and daughters were murdered during an invasion of the family's Cheshire, Connecticut home in July 2007.

Petit told the television station he was excited about anticipating a new baby.

"Children are always your jewels," Petit said.

He did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Convicted in the 2007 murders were Joshua Komisarjevsky and Stephen Hayes, who were both sentenced to death.

Connecticut in 2012 repealed the death penalty for future crimes, but the punishment remains in place for previous cases including Komisarjevsky and Hayes.

The two men held the family hostage for hours, before setting the home on fire. Petit was severely beaten but survived, his wife and daughters were killed.

Komisarjevsky's attorneys said last month they are mulling the possibility of requesting a new trial on the argument that information about the police response was not given to the defense team.



headline: U.S. awards grant for health services a year after Wisconsin Sikh shooting
byline: By Kevin Murphy
8:31am EDT

The U.S. government awarded a $512,000 grant on Friday to fund trauma and mental health services for the Sikh community in southern Wisconsin, nearly a year after a white supremacist killed six Sikh worshippers at a temple near Milwaukee.

The first anniversary of the shootings at the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin is Monday. Some experts have suggested that the man who opened fire might have thought the Sikhs were Muslim. The Sikh religion originated in India and is not related to Islam.

Attorney General Eric Holder said in a blog posting that the grant to the Wisconsin state government is meant to pay for mental health and trauma services for those affected by the shootings, including relatives of victims, witnesses and first responders.

A year later, people connected to victims of the shooting are still suffering and can benefit from the financial assistance, said Satpal Kaleka, widow of Satwant Singh Kaleka, the temple's president who died in the shootings.

"It's wonderful," she said of the money.

In June, the U.S. government announced that it would track hate crimes in more detail, including Sikhs in the list of the categories on which it collects statistics. Some Sikh leaders had said in the wake of the shooting that this data was needed to show the extent of such hate crimes.



headline: Judge denies class certification sought by women suing Wal-Mart
byline: By Casey Sullivan and Dan Levine
8:31am EDT

Mart, a U.S. judge in San Francisco on Friday rejected an attempt to bring reformulated sex discrimination claims against the company as a class action.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer denied a motion for class certification brought by plaintiffs seeking to represent 150,000 women in Wal-Mart's California offices who alleged the world's largest retailer denied them pay raises and promotions because of their gender.

The claims were filed as a reformulated lawsuit after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a larger class-action sex discrimination against Wal-Mart Stores Inc in 2011 that claimed female employees at 3,400 Walmart stores nationwide were underpaid and given fewer promotions.

The California lawsuit was part of a broader strategy by women Wal-Mart workers to bring more narrowly tailored class actions in an attempt to seek damages, targeting Wal-Mart's employment practices in regions throughout the country.

Instead of relying on nationwide statistical patterns and anecdotal evidence provided by plaintiffs, the California lawsuit had alleged specific discriminatory statements made by the district and regional managers that have decision-making authority over pay and promotions.

Breyer said in his ruling that the women could not bring their allegations as a class action because they had not established that their claims of the company's employment practice were linked to a class-wide policy.

But he said: "This order does not consider whether plaintiffs themselves were victims of discrimination as alleged in their complaint; those individual claims shall proceed in this litigation."

Still, Breyer took issue with some of the merits of the plaintiffs case. For one, he said that the women did not identify statistically significant disparities in pay and promotion decisions throughout the California regions at issue.

Breyer also noted that the women said they had anecdotes reflecting stereotyped views expressed by a number of regional managers, but only offered evidence of bias exhibited by about five percent of the top level management that they say guided lower-level decisions.

"Though plaintiffs succeeded in illustrating attitudes of gender bias held by managers at Wal-Mart, they failed to marshal significant proof that intentional discrimination was a general policy affecting the entire class," Breyer said.

A Wal-Mart spokesman said in a statement that the company has had a strong policy against discrimination in place for many years, and that the allegations from the plaintiffs were not representative of the positive experiences of other women working at Wal-Mart.

"Judge Breyer gave the plaintiffs every opportunity to offer any evidence they wanted, and their evidence comes up short," said Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer representing Wal-Mart. "We are gratified."

Plaintiffs lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.



headline: U.S. high court backs order on California prison crowding
byline: By Steve Gorman
8:31am EDT

court order demanding that the nation's largest state prison system reduce its inmate population by about 10,000 convicts this year to ease crowding.

State prison officials, insisting that further cuts are unnecessary, said they were working to meet the court-ordered prison population target by their December 31 deadline, but warned that doing so would be costly and pose a risk to public safety.

The state's petition to the high court, denied by the majority without comment, argued that conditions had improved in the 33-prison system in recent years, despite federal court rulings that overcrowding caused problems with mental health and medical care for inmates.

California's request for a stay was the latest move in a dispute between Governor Jerry Brown and a panel of three federal judges over management of the prison system, which has also been plagued by inmate hunger strikes and occasional violence.

While losing its bid for a stay, the state is continuing to prepare a Supreme Court appeal on the merits of the case, state Corrections and Rehabilitation Department spokesman Jeffrey Callison said.

"In terms of complying with the order in the meantime, it's our position that it would endanger public safety and be expensive," he told Reuters.

Callison said the department is still reviewing a combination of several options, such as sending some prisoners to in-state private facilities or leasing space from county lockups.

State officials have said California already has made substantial progress in easing crowded prison conditions.

Tens of thousands of low-risk inmates are being diverted from state prisons to the local authorities, and good-behavior credits have been expanded for certain classes of inmates to allow earlier releases.

As a result, the state says, the corrections department no longer has to keep overflow inmates in gymnasiums and day rooms, but has returned those facilities to their intended purposes.

EARLY RELEASE VS. PUBLIC SAFETY

The state's high court filing sought a stay of a recent order by the panel of judges to bring prisons to 137.5 percent of capacity, which requires California to either find new facilities for about 10,000 inmates or let them go.

The state contends that target is arbitrary and not necessary to reach in order to improve inmate healthcare.

As of July 24, California's prisons held about 119,300 inmates, roughly 46 percent more than they were meant to house.

"One way to comply would be releasing more than 9,500 prisoners early, but we have no intention of doing that," Callison said.

He said the state had been directed to identify at least 4,000 inmates who could be paroled with a low risk of committing new offenses that would land them back in prison, but the department was only able to find about 1,200.

The three appellate judges ruled in 2009, after years of litigation, that California's prisons can be permitted to exceed their design capacity, but they set a specific cap on the inmate population.

Increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of the state's response, the three judges, Stephen Reinhardt, Lawrence Karlton and Thelton Henderson, have twice threatened Brown with contempt of court. In 2011, the Supreme Court backed up the federal judges, saying the state had to reduce crowding.

As a result of the cases underlying the court order, medical care in the prisons also has been placed under the supervision of a court-appointed federal receiver and mental healthcare is being watched by a special master.

There was no official public vote on the state's latest petition by the nine-member Supreme Court. But three of the court's nine justices, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, went on record in favor of a stay.

The majority's decision to uphold the lower-court order came even as new attention is being focused on California prisons since thousands of inmates launched a hunger strike last month to protest conditions in special housing units where some prisoners are held for prolonged periods in isolation.

The protest is the third and largest hunger strike staged by inmates over solitary confinement in the last two years.

State officials deny the inmates' claims of inhumane conditions, saying that some prisoners have cell mates, are permitted visits and have access to a law library.



headline: California men accused of running pot farm, keeping girl in box
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

old girl in a metal tool box, forcing her to work on a marijuana farm and sexually abusing her pleaded innocent on Friday to a federal indictment as new details emerged in the grim case.

During a hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Ryan Balletto, 30, and Patrick Pearmain, 25, entered not guilty pleas to a federal grand jury indictment charging them with conspiracy and drug offenses. Balletto was also charged with possessing firearms in furtherance of narcotics trafficking.

Federal prosecutors have accused Balletto and Pearmain of keeping the girl, a runaway from the Los Angeles area, captive for weeks at the remote Northern California compound. Authorities who raided the property in May found more than 1,300 marijuana plants and an arsenal of weapons.

The men are accused of making the girl cut marijuana buds and prepare the drug for sale and consumption, and of keeping her locked for days at a time in a tool box measuring four feet long by two feet wide, into which holes had been cut for air.

Prosecutors have said the 680-acre property in Lake County was an illegal cannabis growing operation owned by Balletto. Equipment used for sexual bondage and sadomasochism, including a homemade rack with eyebolts at the corners to immobilize a person, was found on the property.

Federal sex charges were not filed against the men because the girl was not transported across state lines. State charges, which included rape and false imprisonment, were dismissed to allow the federal case to proceed more quickly.

Federal prosecutors have seized on the case to support their crackdown against grow operations and dispensaries that they have said are fronts for large-scale drug traffickers operating under the cover of California's medical marijuana law.

Advocates of more liberalized cannabis laws have argued that the case shows how law enforcement efforts have failed, while broad legalization and regulation of pot would take the marijuana trade out of the hands of a criminal element.

California was the first of 19 states and the District of Columbia to pass laws approving marijuana for medical purposes, though the federal government classifies pot as an illegal narcotic.

In a legal motion filed last week ahead of a bail hearing in the case and made public on Friday, prosecutors said the teenager told law enforcement officers that Balletto and Pearmain had engaged in multiple sex acts with her.

Another person who worked at the grow site told authorities that the two defendants shocked the teen with a cattle prod or Taser device and restrained her on the wooden rack while she was sexually abused, according to the court document.

Prosecutors said the government had obtained a "recorded, Mirandized confession" from Balletto.

According to an affidavit filed by law enforcement, in late April Balletto was already under investigation for narcotics trafficking when Los Angeles police asked sheriff's deputies in Lake County to investigate a tip that he had kidnapped an underage girl to sexually abuse her.

Deputies were unable to find the girl at Balletto's property, the affidavit said, but they got a call from her the following day in which she said that she was OK. Police who traced the cell phone signal then found the teenager with Pearmain in a Sacramento area hotel.

Balletto and Pearmain are due back in court on August 21 for pre-trial proceedings.

headline: Fired employee sues Florida prosecutor of Trayvon Martin case

A former employee of Florida State Attorney Angela Corey's office is suing the prosecutor, claiming he was illegally fired after he testified on behalf of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted in the death of black teenager Trayvon Martin.

Ben Kruidbos, the former director of information technology for Corey's office, is seeking more than $5 million in damages in the lawsuit filed in Jacksonville, according to a legal documents.

Kruidbos was fired after testifying at a pre-trial hearing on June 6 that he believed prosecutors had failed to turn over to the defense, as required by evidence-sharing laws, potentially embarrassing evidence extracted from Martin's cell phone.

His lawyer, Wesley White, said last month that he would file a whistleblower action. This week he filed a separate complaint to the Florida Commission on Human Relations seeking whistleblower status, which could result in the second lawsuit, White said.

White said the lawsuit against Corey, which was filed on Thursday, cited a statute that makes it illegal to fire someone for their testimony when it is given under subpoena. Kruidbos was subpoenaed by the Zimmerman defense team.

"I cannot find a single other case of that statute being litigated," said White.

"Normally people wouldn't do something like that, fire somebody as a result of testifying pursuant to subpoena," Said White, a former prosecutor who worked with Corey.

The action is expected to add to pressure already on Corey, who has been criticized by legal experts for unsuccessfully prosecuting Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer acquitted on July 13 of murder and manslaughter charges in the shooting death of the unarmed teen.

Zimmerman's defense has also called for sanctions against her and her prosecution team.

Corey's office said it would not comment on the lawsuit but re-issued Kruidbos' termination letter, in which her office accused him of hacking confidential information from state computers.

The six-page letter, dated July 11, charged Kruidbos with "deliberate, willful and unscrupulous actions" that make him untrustworthy and "a shallow, but obvious, attempt to cloak yourself in the protection of the whistleblower law."

Kruidbos testified last month in a pre-trial hearing that he found photos on Martin's phone that included pictures of a pile of jewelry on a bed, underage nude females, marijuana plants, and a hand holding a semi-automatic pistol.

He said he informed the prosecutors in January, but Zimmerman's chief defense attorney Mark O'Mara said he did not receive the material until June, shortly before the murder trial began.

The judge ruled that pictures and texts from Martin's cell phone were inadmissible, after prosecutors argued that it could not be proven that Martin had taken the pictures and written the texts. She has yet to rule on whether the prosecution committed any violations by not handing over evidence.

CBS went dark for millions of Time Warner Cable subscribers on Friday after the cable operator and the network's parent company CBS Corp failed to reach an agreement over fees after weeks of contentious negotiations.

The blackout of the No. 1 rated broadcast network followed an increasingly hostile and public battle between the two sides, which accused each other of making unreasonable demands in their talks over how much Time Warner Cable will pay to carry CBS.

CBS, home to hits such as "The Big Bang Theory" and "NCIS," has never been dropped by a cable TV system, it said. An estimated 3.5 million customers are affected in large cities as Los Angeles, New York and Dallas.

The companies issued dueling statements on Friday as Time Warner Cable began dropping CBS and its cable networks, including Showtime, from the company's systems in those markets.

headline: Cleveland police chief calls for discipline of dozens of cops
byline: By Kevin Murphy
8:31am EDT

five Cleveland patrol officers face disciplinary action for a deadly chase last year that ended in the shooting deaths of two unarmed civilians in a car.

Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath said Friday an investigation found the officers violated departmental rules and regulations in the November 29 chase that involved 104 of the 277 officers on duty at the time.

The 74 current officers and one who has since left to become a fireman should be disciplined in some form, he said in a news conference.

Twelve supervisors have already been punished, including nine who were suspended, two demoted and one terminated, McGrath said.

Discipline of the 74 officers could range from written reprimands to suspensions to terminations, the chief said. Those decisions will follow pre-disciplinary hearings.

"The process of helping our community move forward has begun and the review helps us continue on that path," McGrath said in a blog. "The review process has been thorough and the results have been fair."

McGrath said the administrative review involving the 75 officers focused solely on the pursuit, not the use of deadly force, which is being separately investigated by prosecutors.

The chase resulted from a routine traffic stop, spurring particular concern in the African-American community that undue force was used. The driver of the car, Timothy Russell, and the passenger, Marissa Williams, were black.

Officers reported hearing gunshots from Russell's 1979 Chevy. After a 25-minute chase, and after Russell hit a police cruiser and drove toward an officer, police cornered the car in a school parking lot and fired on it. When it was over, 13 officers had fired 137 rounds at the car.

No guns or gunshot residue was found in the car. The chase involved 63 police cars.



headline: Postal Service could start shipping alcohol under Senate proposal
byline: By Elvina Nawaguna
8:31am EDT

strapped Postal Service could tap a rich new revenue stream if Congress adopts the idea of two senators who want to allow it to ship alcohol, a business reserved for more than a century for its private competitors.

The two Republican and Democratic senators late on Thursday introduced legislation to change a 1909 law that prohibits the Postal Service from shipping alcoholic beverages. The ban started a decade before prohibition-era laws made producing, selling and transporting alcohol illegal across the country.

Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat, and the panel's senior Republican, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, jointly sponsored the legislation, whose main purpose is to help the Postal Service tame its runaway finances.

"If it were to shut down, the impact on our economy would be devastating," Carper said. "With the right tools and quick action from Congress, the Postal Service can reform, right-size and modernize."

Supporters of Postal Service reform argue that the 238-year-old mail carrier is stuck in an outdated business model, whose problems include private competitors United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp. The mail-carrier lost nearly $16 billion last year and without action, some expect it to run out of money by October.

The Postal Service estimates alcohol shipments could bring in up to $50 million annually, a spokesman said.

Coburn called the proposal "a rough draft" and hoped it would be part of a solution that "will protect taxpayers and ensure the Postal Service can remain economically viable while providing vital services for the American people."

The senators hope to hold hearings on the Postal bill after Congress returns in September from a month-long recess, but with intense budget and debt ceiling discussions expected in the fall, it is unclear what attention the Postal Service will get.

Much of the Postal Service's financial troubles stem from a 2006 congressional mandate to prefund up to 75 years of its future retirees' healthcare over 10 years. Mail revenues have also dwindled as more Americans prefer to use Internet and email communications.

Carper and Coburn's bill includes other provisions such as replacing the current prefunding requirement with a new plan spread over 40 years.

The agency already has defaulted on two payments to that health fund and expects to default on its next payment of $5.6 billion due at the end of September.

The House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican who has pushed for Postal Reform, said he will work with the two senators. He introduced a bill last month that would ease the healthcare prefund payments, cut Saturday delivery of first class mail and completely eliminate door-to-door delivery.

The Postal Service said it is evaluating whether both the Senate and House bills would enable it to save the $20 billion by 2017 it needs to prevent a taxpayer bailout.



headline: Fish die as Alaska temperatures continue to break records
byline: By Yereth Rosen
8:31am EDT

Alaska's summer heat wave has been pleasant for humans but punitive for some of its fish.

Overheated water has been blamed for large die-offs of hatchery trout and salmon stocks in at least two parts of the state as hot, dry weather has set in, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

Hundreds of grayling and rainbow trout died in June after being placed in a Fairbanks lake, the department reported. An unusually cold spring caused lake ice to linger much longer than normal, before the water quickly became too warm, department biologist April Behr said.

Surface temperatures in the lake rose to about 76 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius), she said. The precise number of dead fish was not yet known. "We picked up several hundred," she said.

A similar incident occurred in mid-July at the Crystal Lake Hatchery south of Petersburg in southeast Alaska.

An estimated 1,100 hatchery king salmon died while returning to a lake to spawn, local public radio station KFSK reported. Fish and Game sport fish biologist Doug Fleming told the radio station that air temperatures were in the 80s at the time.

Record-breaking heat has also created elevated wildfire risks in Alaska, even in the normally rain-soaked Tongass National Forest in the state's southeastern panhandle.

Wildfires have charred more than a million acres across Alaska, according to state and federal wildfire managers, more than the five-year season-total annual average of 952,113 acres. Some 75 active fires were still burning on Friday, with much of the fire season still to come.

WILDFIRE INQUIRY LAUNCHED

One blaze that has consumed 85,000 acres near Fairbanks has drawn congressional scrutiny. The so-called Stuart Creek 2 Fire was sparked in June by Army artillery training conducted in hot, dry conditions against the advice of federal wildfire managers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.

U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said on Thursday she had launched an inquiry into the origins of that blaze, which prompted the evacuation of hundreds of area residents and racked up a firefighting bill of $19 million.

She persuaded the Senate Defense Appropriations subcommittee to insert language into a budget bill requiring the Army to explain its decision to hold the artillery exercise.

Numerous heat records have fallen this year around the state throughout the summer.

Fairbanks on Thursday set a new record for the total number of summer days with temperatures at 80 degrees or above in that city - 31 straight to beat the previous mark of 30 days set in 2004, the National Weather Service said.

Anchorage on Wednesday set a new benchmark for consecutive days with temperatures at 70 degrees or above, with a 14-day run that bested the previous record, set in 2004, by one day.

Daily record temperatures have been set over the past week in Anchorage, Valdez, McGrath and King Salmon. Numerous other communities saw record highs earlier in the summer.

The unusual warm conditions derive from a persistent weather pattern high in the atmosphere above Alaska, according to the National Weather Service.

The heat is expected to gradually give way to cooler, rainier conditions more typical for August as a new pressure system builds over the Bering Sea, said Dan Samelson, a Weather Service meteorologist.

"It'll be a little bit slow in coming," he said.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference, he also argued that marriage is a "constitutional, fundamental civil right" for all Americans.

The Montgomery County Register of Wills, D. Bruce Hanes, an elected official who issues marriage licenses, has been processing the licenses for couples of the same gender for the past week and issued 49 of them as of late Thursday.

The state Health Department, part of the administration of Governor Tom Corbett, a Republican, on Tuesday filed a lawsuit seeking to stop Hanes.

The lawsuit comes less than two weeks after Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane, a Democrat, announced she would not defend the state's ban on same sex marriage.

McGarry, in his filing, argues that only the county's district attorney, the attorney general or a private citizen has the right to challenge Hanes in court.

The county's district attorney, Risa Ferman, did not immediately return a call for comment, but was expected to issue a statement later in the day. The Attorney General's Office declined to comment.

Pennsylvania's Defense of Marriage Act was amended in 1996 to ban same-sex nuptials and to void same-sex marriages of state residents that might have been recognized in another state.

Thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia recognize gay marriage. Among them, Delaware, Minnesota and Rhode Island legalized gay marriage this year. Pennsylvania is among six potential states targeted by gay marriage advocates for a future push to legalize same sex nuptials in 2015 and 2016, according to the Freedom to Marry advocacy group.

Montgomery County, with a population of more than 800,000, borders Philadelphia.



headline: FEMA declares West fertilizer explosion in Texas a major disaster
byline: By Jim Forsyth
8:31am EDT

The Obama Administration on Friday declared the deadly fertilizer plant explosion in the central Texas community of West in April to be a major disaster, approving the use of wider federal funding to help the town rebuild.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency declined to issue a disaster declaration in June on the grounds that state resources were adequate to help the community of 2,800 rebuild. But FEMA now says it will make federal funding "available to state and eligible local governments and certain private non profit organizations for emergency work," as well as to repair or replace public facilities damaged by the explosion.

"The approval of the state's appeal for a major disaster declaration is great and welcome news for the people of West," Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement.

In a letter to President Obama appealing the denial of disaster funding, Perry said: "The long term viability of this small Texas city is dependent on your decision."

Disaster declarations are generally issued in response to natural catastrophes such as storms or floods that affect a wide area.

The FEMA decision means the city of West will qualify for federal funding to help public works entities get rebuilt, Josh Havens, Perry's deputy press secretary, told Reuters. He says eligible projects will include public buildings, roads and school facilities.

A fire and resulting ammonium nitrate fertilizer explosion at the West Fertilizer Company plant on the evening of April 17 killed 15 people, injured more than 160, and damaged or destroyed dozens of homes, businesses and public buildings in the community north of Waco.

Friday's announcement is "wonderful" news for Marty Crawford. The superintendent of the West Independent School District estimates his buildings suffered as much as $60 million in damage in the explosion. Most of the school buildings were located within 800 yards of the blast site.

"This proves to me that the federal and state governments are standing arm in arm with our community in our long road to recovery," Crawford told Reuters.

He said much of the tax base that supports the school district of 1,450 students was destroyed in the explosion, making it far more difficult to raise the funds needed to repair and replace school buildings.

"The challenge of raising the property tax rate would have been impossible," Crawford said. The McLennan County Tax Appraisal District estimated that the community's property tax base lost $40 million, and the governor's office says the city and the school district's credit rating has been downgraded because of the explosion's impact on property values.

Despite the initial denial of a Presidential disaster declaration, FEMA and other federal agencies have been active in helping the community. Crawford said $2.75 million in so-called "Category B" federal emergency funding has been used, for example, to help obtain the temporary buildings that will house his district's students for as long as three years.

FEMA funding also helped pay for 75 percent of the debris removal costs and helped reimburse the cost of the emergency response, according to figures provided by the governor's office.

Havens says assistance through FEMA's "Individuals and Households Program" was also provided to help West residents deal with the immediate aftermath of the explosion. The recently completed session of the Texas Legislature also provided disaster assistance to West.

FEMA also said Friday's disaster declaration will allow it to share the costs of "hazard mitigation measures" to prevent similar fertilizer plant disasters across the state.

The declaration comes one day after Obama signed an executive order calling on government agencies to study tougher safety regulations for chemical storage facilities.



headline: History shows Snowden may face tough exile in Russia
byline: By Alissa de Carbonnel
8:31am EDT

U.S. fugitive Edward Snowden seems assured of a warm welcome in Russia and may even achieve celebrity status in his new home, but history suggests he will no longer be master of his fate and a Moscow exile will bring some difficult challenges.

The former U.S. spy agency contractor finally left Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Thursday after spending nearly six weeks confined to its transit zone while a diplomatic battle over his future raged between Russia and the United States.

Snowden, sought by Washington on espionage charges for leaking details of Internet and phone surveillance programs, now embarks on his new life armed with an asylum document that is valid for a year and can be renewed annually.

Former Russian intelligence officers said things will not be easy for Snowden - a highly interesting catch for the Kremlin - if the legacy of earlier defections is any guide.

"Precedents show us that life is hard for defectors from their countries," Lev Korolkov, a former officer in the Soviet KGB security service, told Reuters.

"They experience a huge internal stress that can last for a very long time, sometimes for the rest of their lives - even for those who stayed, such as Kim Philby," he said, referring to one of the British 'Cambridge ring' who spied for the Soviet Union during and after World War Two.

"He (Snowden) was free only as long as he was in the transit zone," Korolkov added.

Snowden is not the first employee of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to defect to Moscow.

NSA cryptologists William Martin and Bernon Mitchell defected to the Soviet Union during the Cold War in 1960 because of disenchantment with U.S. intelligence gathering methods.

The pair denounced Washington for spying on its own allies - charges echoed by Snowden half a century later.

But Martin later called his choice foolhardy as he became disillusioned with the less than ideal life in the Soviet Union and the relevance of their revelations quickly faded.

BRITISH DEFECTORS

Other precedents are hardly more encouraging.

Philby, recruited by the Soviets at Cambridge in the 1930s, lived under virtual house arrest after his defection, drank heavily and suffered from loneliness and depression.

Fellow double agent and comrade Guy Burgess also became heavily dependent on alcohol and, despite defecting, continued ordering clothes from London.

Of the high-profile British defectors, only George Blake - not a member of the Cambridge ring - seems to have done well in exile. He married a Russian, is still alive at 90 and was awarded a medal by President Vladimir Putin last year.

The Cold War is long over but some things do not change. Snowden is a useful propaganda tool for the Kremlin, which often accuses Washington of preaching on human rights abroad what it fails to practice at home.

"He no longer belongs to himself. He is a political personality and a pawn," said Anna Kachkayeva, a prominent media expert.

"He is like a ticking time-bomb. Maybe they will save him up for something and put him on television - or maybe not."

The Kremlin's decision to harbor Snowden has gone down well with Russian public opinion.

"I don't think he is a traitor, so I think we did the right thing," said a Moscow resident who gave his name as Ivan.

St Petersburg resident Yevgeny agreed. "The Americans have gone too far and someone should wipe their nose. The man stood for the truth, he told the world and we needed to protect him."

Forty three percent of Russians back the plan to harbor Snowden while 29 percent are against, according to a survey published on Wednesday by independent pollster Levada.

Snowden has even received a marriage proposal from former Russian spy Anna Chapman, over Twitter, and a job offer from Russia's answer to social networking site Facebook.

TV CELEBRITY?

A Russian lawyer who is helping Snowden, Anatoly Kucherena, said he had letters from others seeking to hire Snowden, adding that the American would not want for employment.

"I don't exclude that he will have his own TV show," he told Reuters.

The Kremlin has given no indication it wants to turn Snowden into a television star. However, Russian state television has already become a platform for Wikileaks anti-secrecy group founder, Julian Assange, to rail against the United States.

Snowden will stay for now with U.S. expatriates who support his security leaks, Kucherena said, adding that he would soon bring over Snowden's father, Lonnie, along with a U.S. lawyer and other friends, to give the fugitive "moral support".

But Snowden remains vulnerable to a fluid political climate and his usefulness to his Russian hosts will steadily diminish.

"There have always been defectors and their baggage is their knowledge, abilities and skills - what is in his head," ex-KGB officer Korolkov said. But he added: "You know information gets old and loses its value."

Snowden may find that in Russia, he has traded some part of his freedom for security, some experts say.

"I think he may find Russia less appealing than he might have imagined," said Misha Glenny, a British author on Internet security and eastern Europe.

"Snowden may find that it is very, very difficult for him to be involved in some of the activities he wishes to engage in."



headline: Boston mob boss 'Whitey' Bulger calls trial a sham, declines to testify
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

Former Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger on Friday called his trial on murder and racketeering charges "a sham" and declined to take the witness stand, as his defense rested its case.

"My thing is, as far as I'm concerned ... this is a sham and do what you want with me," Bulger, 83, told U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper in the Boston court house after his lawyer announced he would not testify.

Separately, Massachusetts prosecutors said they believed the death of a witness in the Bulger trial last month was unrelated to the case. They said the man, Steven Rakes, had apparently been poisoned by a business associate who "acted alone."

Bulger, once Boston's most-feared criminal, was charged with participating in the murders of 19 people while heading Boston's Winter Hill crime gang in the 1970s and '80s. He has pleaded not guilty, though his lawyers have admitted he was involved in extortion, drug smuggling and loan sharking.

Casper asked Bulger whether his choice not to testify in his defense was voluntary.

Standing in a dark collarless shirt, and trademark jeans and white sneakers, Bulger responded: "I'm making the choice involuntarily because I feel I've been choked off of the opportunity to give an adequate defense."

Bulger was listed as an FBI informant for years while running the Winter Hill Gang and claimed to have struck a deal with a now-deceased assistant U.S. attorney protecting him from prosecution, but Casper ruled he has no immunity.

He fled Boston in 1994 on a tip from a corrupt FBI agent that arrest was imminent. He was on the FBI's most wanted list for years, but was not captured until 2011.

Lawyers for both sides are scheduled to present closing arguments in the case on Monday, and the jury is expected to begin deliberations on Tuesday.

Bulger was "at peace" with his decision not to testify, his attorney J.W. Carney told reporters outside the court house.

"I met with him afterwards. He was very calm and very pleased that he made the decision that he did, because he feels it was the right one," he said.

'HANDS ON KILLER'

Government prosecutors presented seven weeks worth of testimony from former FBI agents, hit men, drug smugglers, extortion victims, and family members of the dead to paint Bulger as a "hands-on killer".

Witnesses, including former partners of Bulger's, said he strangled women, gunned down "rats" who talked too much, and threatened drug dealers and businessmen with pistols and machine guns to force them to hand over cash.

Defense lawyers sought to undermine the testimony, saying many prosecution witnesses were ex-criminals who had cut plea deals, and that FBI files came from a Boston office that was tainted by corruption and mismanagement.

In the midst of the trial, Rakes turned up dead in a Boston suburb. He had attended the trial almost daily, and was a potential witness in the government's case who claimed Bulger strong-armed him to sell his South Boston liquor store for pennies on the dollar.

Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said on Friday that police had arrested one of Rakes' business partners, William Camuti, on charges that he gave Rakes a coffee laced with cyanide. A spokeswoman for Ryan, Stephanie Guyotte, said prosecutors believe Camuti "acted alone".

Bulger's story has captured Boston's imagination for decades, and recalled a dark period for Boston's FBI when corrupt agents wined and dined gangsters and gave them tips that helped them evade arrest and identify snitches.

His story inspired the character played by Jack Nicholson in Martin Scorsese's 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed."

Bulger was finally captured in 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he had been living with his girlfriend in an apartment with stacks of cash and weapons.



headline: Bus strike idles Phoenix-area commuters for a second day
byline: By David Schwartz
8:31am EDT

Negotiations to resolve a labor dispute between union bus drivers and management ramped up on Friday as more than 57,000 weekday commuters in the Phoenix area were forced to find alternative routes to work for a second day.

Negotiators from the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1443 and bus operator First Transit returned to the bargaining table with the help of a federal mediator with hopes of ending a strike that has shut down 40 mostly suburban bus routes.

Affected by the walkout were the cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa and Tempe and other routes that reach into Phoenix and Scottsdale. Most bus routes were operating in Phoenix, which is served by different providers, and the light rail system for the Phoenix Valley was not idled.

Late on Thursday, both sides reported tentative agreement on a sticking point involving job security and workplace conditions. Another issue in the dispute is the company's attempt to increase employee healthcare contributions.

"We feel optimistic that they met again this morning," said Susan Tierney, a spokeswoman for Valley Metro, the public agency that contracts for the bus service. "We're feeling somewhat hopeful ... we could have service back soon."

Tierney said calls continue to trickle into the agency's customer service line with questions about the strike and possible ways to and from work. The agency has urged commuters to carpool or work at home if possible.

First Transit and union officials have been embroiled in talks since the beginning of the year to forge a contract for the roughly 400 drivers who walked off the job early on Thursday.

Union officials reported on Wednesday that 95 percent of its drivers had voted to reject First Transit's offer. Another last-minute proposal by management failed to avert the strike.

Bob Bean, the union local's president, told Reuters that negotiations were continuing toward a resolution, but that no agreement had been reached. A spokesman for First Transit could not immediately be reached for comment.

Tierney said there have been discussions about implementing a skeleton service for affected riders, but no decision had been made.

"We continue to look at a contingency plan," she said. "We do hope that this agreement can be finalized soon so we can get back to our regularly scheduled service."



headline: Texas is running out of execution drug pentobarbital
byline: By Jim Forsyth
8:31am EDT

Texas, the state with the highest execution rate in the country, is running out of a sedative used for lethal injections for the second time in 13 months, a state official said on Thursday.

Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark confirmed that the state's supply of pentobarbital, which has been used in the execution of condemned killers in the state since July 2012, will reach its expiration date in September.

Texas switched to pentobarbital, a barbiturate that is the drug of choice for physician-assisted suicide in Europe, when supplies of sodium thiopental, previously used by the state in a three-drug execution mix, were cut off.

The Illinois-based pharmaceutical company Hospira Inc said in 2011 it would stop making thiopental after the government of Italy, where it planned to move production of the drug, raised objections, citing its use in executions.

Richard Dieter, who heads the Death Penalty Information Center, said Texas and other states that were forced to switch from thiopental are now facing a problem with the availability of pentobarbital, which is often used to euthanize pets and other animals.

Texas has executed 11 inmates so far in 2013 - including one Wednesday night - while 10 executions have been carried out elsewhere in the country. Officials said five more Texas executions are scheduled for this year, with the next one set for September 19.

Clark said Texas is confident it will be able to continue executions but did not say whether September's execution may have to be delayed.

"Alternate sources of pentobarbital are possible, or an alternate drug," he said.

Dieter said all executions carried out in the United States during the past 13 months have used pentobarbital. He said some states are in the process of obtaining the necessary legal approval to switch to other sedatives.

One option is the surgical anesthetic propofol, which was blamed for the 2009 death of singer Michael Jackson. Missouri revised its execution protocol in 2012 to include it but the state has not had an execution since the protocol was changed.

Makers of the drug have objected to its possible use in executions.

States might consider turning to so-called compounding pharmacies, small laboratories that can remix existing narcotics to fill specific needs, generally on the order of a doctor, Dieter said. But compounding pharmacies might also be reluctant to cooperate on moral grounds.

"They have their own ethics," he said. "I'm not sure that will be a fruitful way to go."

Texas has executed 503 prisoners - more than any other state - since a 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling affirming capital punishment.



headline: Russian airport limbo ends for Snowden, new life begins
byline: By Lidia Kelly, Alissa de Carbonnel and Timothy Heritage
8:31am EDT

After nearly six weeks in hiding at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, Edward Snowden walked calmly out of the transit area, ducked into a car and was driven away unnoticed.

It was an anti-climactic end to one chapter of a saga watched by the world in which the American, wanted in Washington for leaking details of secret U.S. surveillance programs, stayed out of sight for almost 40 days and nights.

Hardly any pictures of him appeared in that time. One showed the 30-year-old meeting human rights activists at the airport, another showed him about to leave the airport.

But by the time that photograph was shown on Russian state television on Thursday evening, Snowden was long gone.

Many questions remain about the former U.S. spy agency contractor's time in the transit area, a no-man's-land for those with connecting flights who normally stay, at most, a few hours.

But a picture is emerging of a man who had become physically and mentally exhausted, increasingly anxious for some certainty about his future and desperate for something resembling normality after two months on the run.

"During his time there it was very difficult, psychologically difficult, because when someone's waiting he doesn't understand what will happen," his Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, told Reuters in an interview.

"His first desire was to gulp the fresh Moscow air."

Snowden was at first incredulous when Kucherena told him Russia had granted him a year's temporary asylum, and then delighted. Kucherena said he left the airport with a backpack, a string bag and a sense of relief.

"Imagine yourself daily (having to listen to) 'Dear passengers, the flight to New York, the flight to Washington, the flight from Rome'," Kucherena said.

"He needs a period of rehabilitation, or adaptation, because he is very tired and morally exhausted."

LIFE IN THE CAPSULE

Kucherena, who serves on a board that advises Russia's FSB security service, a successor of the KGB, is one of the few people who have had direct contact with Snowden since he arrived at Sheremetyevo from Hong Kong on June 23.

The others include Sarah Harrison, a legal researcher for the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group, and a few airport officials. Kucherena said American friends, with whom he said Snowden would now stay, had also visited him at the airport.

Kucherena is giving little away about how Snowden managed to avoid the hordes of reporters who tried for weeks to catch a glimpse of him, but he said he spent at least some of the time at a hotel for transit passengers at Terminal E.

Airport sources said he had slept at least some of the time in the Capsule Hotel, with its grey rooms and sparse, basic but clean interiors. But one added: "He made sure that none of the ordinary people working there saw him."

Hotel sources said however Snowden and a female companion, thought to be Harrison, had checked out prices soon after his arrival but then left without checking in.

To relieve Snowden's boredom, Kucherena brought him Russian literature including Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 19th-century novel Crime and Punishment, in which the main character is racked by guilt over a crime he has committed - an old woman's murder.

He also brought Snowden changes of clothes, pizza and a Russian-English dictionary as he prepared for the next stage of his life, learning the Russian for "Hi", "Bye-bye" and "I'll give you a call."

DISAPPEARING ACT

Snowden's trail went cold as soon as he landed at Sheremetyevo on a flight from Hong Kong, where he had feared he would be arrested after lying low there for two weeks.

Snowden did not come through the usual exit into the transit zone. Other passengers saw cars waiting on the runway and said he must have been whisked away by security officers.

"There were a lot of police and black cars when we were getting off the plane," said one passenger.

Snowden disappeared into the warren of corridors, rooms, and security zones that make up the transit area between the runway and passport control. He hid so well that the cat-and-mouse game with reporters turned to farce.

"Have you found him yet?" a Russian security officer asked journalists at the airport a few days into the saga. Then he burst into mocking laughter.

Snowden came prepared to spend only one night at the airport but his plans soon started to unravel as a diplomatic battle broke out over his request for political asylum in Ecuador.

There are no direct flights from Moscow to Ecuador so Snowden's next step would have been to take a flight to Cuba.

Sources at the national carrier, Aeroflot, say he was booked on flight 105 to Havana on June 24, the day after his arrival. He and Harrison checked in over the Internet and then again over a mobile device in the hours leading up to take-off.

But 12 minutes after the already-delayed plane was scheduled to depart, they cancelled their tickets, the sources said. The Airbus A330 took off almost 40 minutes later with a plane full of journalists and Snowden nowhere to be seen.

After that, carts of food were wheeled in and out of special lounges at the airport, and guards blocked a door to a concealed area in the transit zone. Snowden remained out of view.

The conditions were a step down from Hong Kong, where he had stayed at the five-star Mira hotel as he gave details of the NSA's surveillance work to journalists.

PUTIN'S DILEMMA

It was not until the second day after Snowden's arrival at Sheremetyevo that President Vladimir Putin confirmed Snowden's arrival, which was both a propaganda tool and a headache.

Giving Snowden asylum was certain to anger the United States. Sending him home would help warm up relations with President Barack Obama but open Putin to domestic criticism - polls showed Russians supported giving Snowden asylum.

Putin said the case was something he would have preferred not to have to deal with.

Speculation has been rife that Russian security services "debriefed" Snowden to find out more about the operations of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) he had worked for briefly. Moscow and Kucherena deny this, and say there was no special deal to secure Snowden's asylum status.

Snowden found himself trapped as the United States revoked his passport and put fierce pressure on other countries not to allow any plane carrying him to use its airspace.

He may have fully understood the seriousness of his plight only after four European allies of the United States on July 2 refused to let a plane taking Bolivian President Evo Morales home from Moscow enter their airspace because they thought Snowden was on board.

Nicaragua, Venezuela and Bolivia offered to shelter Snowden, but he feared his plane would be intercepted en route.

Snowden then summoned human rights activists and lawyers to meet him at Sheremetyevo on July 12, apparently to prepare the way for a temporary asylum request in Russia. People who took part said Snowden looked pale, thin and nervous.

He managed to retain a dry sense of humor. The same day, in response to an email from a Reuters journalist who had spent a lot of time at the airport, he replied: "I, too, have been spending a bit of time in the airport."

Kucherena said during the meeting he asked Snowden why he had not applied for asylum in Russia. As soon as he took up Snowden's cause, signs grew that his case would be successful.

Snowden's father, Lonnie, appeared on Russian television on Wednesday in what may have been a move to prepare Russians for Edward Snowden leaving the airport.

"There is little doubt that this was a dramatic, television preamble to some kind of event," Anna Kachkayeva, a prominent media expert, said of the interview. She said it was intended to "evoke a sense of sympathy from many people".

Snowden's future in Russia is uncertain. His document allows him to work and travel and can be renewed multiple times.

He has received a marriage proposal from former Russian spy Anna Chapman, albeit sent online without meeting him, and a job offer from a Russian social networking site.

Kucherena says he cannot rule out that Snowden might host a television chat show.

"He needs to work. He is not a rich man and the money that he had, he has of course spent on food," he said. "Of course he understands that he has to work and he has to keep on living."

air, authorities said on Friday.

The F-16C Falcon jets from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland were on a routine training mission late on Thursday when they "clipped wings", the National Guard said in a statement.

They were about 35 miles southeast of Chincoteague, Virginia, according to the Coast Guard.

One of the pilots ejected and his ejection seat sent a satellite-aided distress signal that alerted the Coast Guard to the crash at 10:28 p.m. on Thursday, the Coast Guard said.

The pilot, who had minor injuries, used an emergency raft to stay afloat until he was rescued by an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter at about 12:30 a.m. Friday.

The other pilot was able to fly his jet back to base.

The pilots, who were not identified, are attached to the 113th Wing D.C. Air National Guard.

"We are extremely fortunate to have lost only metal, and not the life of one of our Airmen," Brigadier General Marc Sasseville, the 113th Wing Commander, said in a statement.

The Air National Guard said on Friday that salvage operations were under way to retrieve the damaged jet, which was in water 100 feet deep.

The cost of an F-16C Falcon jet is $18.8 million, according to the U.S. Air Force website.



headline: FDA issues new rules for labeling 'gluten-free' foods

free" will need to meet new standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The standards, announced on Friday, are designed to protect patients with celiac disease, an inflammatory condition of the intestine triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. It affects about 3 million people in the United States.

Under the new rules, any food bearing a gluten-free label must have less than .002 percent of gluten. The European Union and Canada have implemented the same gluten-free standards.

Food manufacturers have one year to comply with the rule. Labels that boast "no gluten," "free of gluten" and "without gluten" must also meet the standard.

"It's enormously important for these people to have as much variety to choose from as possible," Michael Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine, said in an interview.

The FDA believes most foods with a gluten-free label currently meet the standard, Taylor said.

Gluten-free labeled foods have not previously been subject to a legal standard, posing a danger for many celiac patients, said Francine Fazio, vice president of the Celiacs Resource Group, a support group for celiac patients.

"It's so hard to go through the aisles and buy foods that are safe and tasty," Fazio said. "Now we can buy food with confidence that's safe to eat, just like the general public."

Consuming gluten can cause nutritional deficiencies in celiac patients and lead to osteoporosis, stunted growth, infertility, miscarriages, intestinal cancers and other health problems, according to the FDA.

Gluten is naturally present in wheat, rye, barley and hybrids. It is also sometimes present in vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms and some medications.

The FDA began examining potential regulations more than six years ago when Congress passed the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, requiring the FDA to develop guidelines for gluten-free labels.

The agency proposed gluten-free regulations in 2007 but did not finalize them. The delay came from scientific assessments, interaction with the celiac community and a safety assessment to validate 20 parts per million as a safe cut-off level, Taylor said.

More than 95 percent of celiac patients go undiagnosed, according to the National Institutes of Health. Undiagnosed celiac disease can quadruple the risk of death, according to studies from the Mayo Clinic.



headline: Detroit tells judge it wants to file restructuring plan by year-end
byline: By Nick Carey and Joseph Lichterman
8:31am EDT

was an early sign of controversy in the historic case.

Detroit's target filing date would be much sooner than the March 1, 2014 date proposed earlier this week by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing the case. David Heiman, an attorney with Jones Day, the law firm representing Detroit, said while the city would "enthusiastically accept" the judge's deadline, it wants to move faster.

"Our view is that time is our enemy," Heiman said. "The facts are not going to change no matter how long we wait â&euro;Ś So we aim to file a plan by the end of the year."

Judge Rhodes' decision to approve the formation of a creditors' committee representing retired city workers came despite objections to the move from unions and pension plans representing active and former city workers.

Unions argued the committee should include labor union representatives. They also asked the judge to adjust his timetable for the case to allow the committee to become established and permit negotiation and mediation with the city.

The judge approved the city's offer to pay costs associated with the committee's work.

Daniel McDermott, the United States Trustee, will form the committee. In a court filing on Thursday, McDermott had said the court can direct him to change the committee's composition if it finds it lacks adequate representation.

The aggressive target date for filing a reorganization plan may prove a tall order for Detroit if recent municipal bankruptcies are a worthy guide. But the timeline reflects the urgency Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, has expressed in his push to get the city's broken finances back on track.

Before it can file a reorganization plan, Detroit must prove its eligibility to proceed through the bankruptcy process in a trial the judge has proposed holding in late October. That alone would be remarkably fast if the timeline holds: Stockton, California, took nearly a year to be declared Chapter 9 eligible and San Bernardino, California, is still awaiting a declaration more than a year after filing for protection.

Detroit in its eligibility phase is required to prove it is insolvent and has negotiated in good faith with creditors owed more than $18 billion or that there are too many creditors to make negotiating feasible.

If Detroit meets the eligibility test, Judge Rhodes would allow the city to file a reorganization plan that creditors can object to and that the judge must then approve.

Jim Spiotto, a municipal bankruptcy expert at law firm Chapman and Cutler in Chicago, said that a "contentious" bankruptcy would take longer.

Judge Rhodes on Tuesday proposed October 23 for the start of a trial on potential objections to Detroit's eligibility to remain in court after filing the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Orr has told the court he wants the city to exit bankruptcy by September 2014.

Heiman told the judge that Detroit is continuing talks with its creditors, but "significant difficulties" make a deal hard to reach.

He added that Detroit held talks with the city's unsecured creditors last week and has scheduled more for Friday and next week.

In a court filing on Thursday, Detroit released a list of creditors, including current, former and retired workers, that filled 3,504 pages. Prominent among them are bondholders and pension funds.

A group of about 20 protesters outside the federal courthouse in Detroit on Friday held signs and chanted, "hands off our pensions" and "make the banks pay."

Detroit workers, retirees and pension funds have already tried to derail the bankruptcy petition in state court on Michigan constitutional grounds. But Rhodes suspended their lawsuits at the first hearing in the case on July 24, putting his court in full control of the case.

Rhodes also gave parties in the case seven days to nominate an independent fee examiner. The judge acknowledged that his power to appoint an examiner is not the same as in a Chapter 11 corporate proceeding. Still, he said, the "blunt truth" is that if fees are processed by an examiner "the city's professionals will be in a much better position to justify their fees and the city will thus be able to justify those fees to the public."

Meanwhile, Orr on Friday proposed a new healthcare plan for city workers that would save Detroit $12 million annually by raising deductibles and trimming the number of available plans.

A firefighter killed while battling a central Oregon wildfire has been identified as John Hammack of Madras, Oregon, officials said on Friday, as crews briefly aided by cooler, wetter weather grappled with blazes that have blackened more than 200 square miles of the Pacific Northwest.

Hammack was killed and another firefighter was injured when a tree fell on them as they fought a blaze outside the town of Sisters on Thursday.

The surviving firefighter, Norman Crawford, was treated at a hospital for shoulder injuries, and has been released, according to local reports. Both men, contract tree fellers, were part of a firefighting team.

The current fire season has been particularly deadly in the U.S. West. Nineteen Arizona firefighters died in June after they became trapped by a wind-whipped inferno, and two people perished after being caught in a blaze in Colorado.

Thousands of firefighters fought to snuff out or at least contain blazes that had burned more than 40,000 acres of timber and range land across Oregon on Friday, 5,000 acres more than on Thursday, said Carol Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center.

Nighttime and early-morning lightning strikes sparked dozens of new fires, Connelly said, adding that emergency crews were helped by cooler temperatures and higher humidity, a streak likely to end next week with hotter weather and possibly more lightning-bearing storms.

In neighboring Washington state, more than 2,100 firefighters were making steady progress against a pair of blazes that have scorched more than 107,000 acres east of the Cascade Range.

Roughly 45 structures remained at high risk from the so-called Colockum Tarps fire burning south of Wenatchee, said Mary Ellen Fitzgerald, a U.S. Forest Service official and a spokeswoman for firefighting efforts.

That fire, which has burned more than 80,000 acres in less than one week, has claimed three houses and five other buildings, including three outhouses. It was 30 percent contained as of Friday morning as firefighters were aided by light rain and fortuitous winds pushing smoke away from the containment line, Fitzgerald said.

Further south, the so-called Mile Marker 28 fire, which has blackened 27,000 acres close to the Oregon border, is 75 percent contained, with residents of 69 homes forced to flee allowed to return as of Wednesday.

A woman accused of splashing green paint on parts of the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., can be released to a halfway house to await trial on a property destruction charge, a judge ruled on Friday.

Jia M. Tian, 58, is accused of dumping the paint on a pipe organ and on woodwork in two chapels at the cathedral. She carried a Chinese passport with an expired visa and has been jailed since her arrest on Monday.

Superior Court Judge Fredrick Sullivan ruled that she could be moved to a halfway house if she wears an ankle monitor, but she will not be allowed to see visitors or to leave the facility before her next court hearing on August 29.

Metropolitan Police Officer Christopher Carkeet testified that it could cost $15,000 to $18,000 to repair the cathedral.

Investigators said a witness had seen Tian sitting in the church after services ended and just before the vandalism occurred.

The property destruction charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

Police were still investigating whether Tian was involved in similar acts of vandalism at other Washington landmarks last week. Paint was splashed onto the Lincoln Memorial and used to put symbols on a statue outside the Smithsonian Institution.

A detective testified that a footprint found at the Lincoln Memorial after the splashing had a tread pattern matching that on Tian's shoes.



headline: Aetna exits Obamacare exchange in Maryland over price
byline: By Caroline Humer
8:31am EDT

Aetna Inc pulled out of Maryland's health insurance exchange being created under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law after the state pressed it to lower its proposed rates by up to 29 percent.

Under the law, often called Obamacare, each U.S. state will have an online exchange where Americans will be able to buy insurance plans, starting on October 1. The government is counting on about 7 million people to enroll next year for this insurance, many of whom will qualify for subsidies.

The success of the exchanges, as well as the expansion of the government's Medicaid program for the poor, are key elements in the political battle between Republicans and Democrats. State officials say the price of the new insurance plans will help determine whether enough people sign up.

In an August 1 letter sent to the Maryland Department of Insurance, Aetna said the state's requirement for rate reductions off its proposed prices would lead it to operate at a loss. The rate reductions include products from Aetna and Coventry Health Care, which it bought this spring.

"Unfortunately, we believe the modifications to the rates filed by Aetna and Coventry would not allow us to collect enough premiums to cover the cost of the plans, including the medical network and service expectations of our customers," Aetna said in the letter to insurance commissioner Therese Goldsmith.

According to online documents, Aetna had requested an average monthly premium of $394 a month for one of its plans and the agency had approved an average rate of $281 per month.

Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said earlier this week during a conference call to announce financial results that it was closely looking at its plans for the exchanges since buying Coventry.

Like most other large U.S. insurers, Aetna has taken a cautious approach to the new products which must include a broader set of benefits and be sold to all people regardless of their health.

On Friday, Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said the decision to withdraw from the individual market in Maryland included both new plans proposed for the exchange and new products for the individual market. Aetna and Coventry combined insure 13,000 individual members in Maryland and 620,000 individuals nationwide.

"This is not a step we take lightly," she said.

Aetna said it was not clear yet how the move would affect all of its current policyholders in the state.

Maryland's Insurance Administration, which provided a copy of the letter, declined to make an immediate comment beyond the explanation of its rate modification decision posted online. It announced approved rates on July 26.

In the online document, the agency said that many factors went into its request for a lower rate, such as Aetna's assumptions about the health of people who apply for insurance on the exchange. Healthy people cost less to insure.

Earlier this year, Aetna and UnitedHealth Group Inc both said they would withdraw from the individual market in California, where they had not planned to sell exchange-based products but would have had to change off-exchange individual policies there to meet the same standards.

headline: Russia gives Snowden asylum, Obama-Putin summit in doubt
byline: By Timothy Heritage and Steve Holland
8:31am EDT

Russia rejected U.S. pleas and granted American fugitive Edward Snowden a year's asylum on Thursday, letting the former spy agency contractor slip out of a Moscow airport after more than five weeks in limbo while angering the United States and putting in doubt a planned summit between the two nations' presidents.

The United States wanted Russia to send Snowden home to face criminal charges including espionage for disclosing in June secret American internet and telephone surveillance programs. The White House signaled that President Barack Obama may boycott a September summit with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

Snowden, whose disclosures triggered an international furor over the reach of U.S. spy operations as part of its counterterrorism efforts, thanked Russia for his temporary asylum and declared that "the law is winning."

Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden's Russian lawyer, said the 30-year-old had found shelter in a private home of American expatriates.

Putin's move aggravated relations with the United States that were already strained by Russian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's bloody civil war and a host of other issues.

"We see this as an unfortunate development and we are extremely disappointed by it," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters in Washington. "We are evaluating the utility of a summit, in light of this and other issues, but I have no announcement today on that.

Other high-level U.S.-Russian talks were also put in doubt.

Discussions planned for next week between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and their Russian counterparts are now "up in the air," according to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, has avoided the hordes of reporters trying to find him since he landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport from Hong Kong on June 23. He gave them the slip again as he left the transit area where he had been holed up.

State television showed Snowden, wearing a backpack and a blue button-up shirt, getting into a gray car at the airport, driven by a young man in a baseball cap.

"Over the past eight weeks we have seen the Obama administration show no respect for international or domestic law but in the end the law is winning," Snowden, whose first leaks were published two months ago, was quoted as saying by the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group, which has assisted him.

"I thank the Russian Federation for granting me asylum in accordance with its laws and international obligations."

Grainy images on state television showed Snowden's document, which is similar to a Russian passport, and revealed that he had been granted asylum for a year from July 31.

'MOST WANTED MAN'

"He is the most wanted man on planet Earth," Kucherena told Reuters.

Kucherena said Snowden wanted to rent an apartment and find work in Russia, and had no immediate plans to leave.

Snowden, who had his U.S. passport revoked by Washington, had bided his time in the transit area between the runway and passport control, which Russia considers neutral territory.

"He needs to work. He is not a rich man, and the money that he had, he has of course, spent on food," said Kucherena, who sits on two high-profile Russian government advisory bodies.

"Snowden is an expert, a very high-level expert, and I am receiving letters from companies and citizens who would eagerly give him a job. He will not have any problems," the lawyer said.

Snowden already has been offered a job by Russia's top social networking site.

A pledge not to publish more information that could harm the United States was the condition under which Putin said Snowden could receive safe harbor. "Edward assured me that he is not planning to publish any documents that blacken the American government," Kucherena said.

Snowden was accompanied by Sarah Harrison, a WikiLeaks legal researcher. "We would like to thank the Russian people and all those others who have helped to protect Mr. Snowden. We have won the battle - now the war," WikiLeaks said on Twitter.

"I am so thankful to the Russian nation and President Vladimir Putin," the American's father, Lonnie Snowden, told Russian state television.

and about arranging a visit to Russia by Snowden's father and his legal team to see his son, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.

Lonnie Snowden has not had direct contact with his son yet and "nobody knows where he (Edward) is," the source said.

The visit to Russia could occur in the next three weeks or so, the source said.

U.S. LAWMAKERS INCENSED

Prominent U.S. lawmakers - Republicans and Democrats - condemned Russia's action and urged Obama to take stern retaliatory steps beyond the issue of the September summit.

It is not clear whether Obama might also consider a boycott of the G20 summit in Russia in September, immediately after the planned summit with Putin, or of the Winter Olympics, which Russia will host in the city of Sochi next February.

"Russia has stabbed us in the back, and each day that Mr. Snowden is allowed to roam free is another twist of the knife," said Senator Chuck Schumer, a close Obama ally and fellow Democrat who urged Obama to recommend moving out of Russia the summit of G20 leaders planned for St. Petersburg.

Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, already sharp critics of Putin, called Russia's action a disgrace and a deliberate effort to embarrass the United States. They said the United States should retaliate by pushing for completion of all missile-defense programs in Europe and moving for another expansion of NATO to include Russian neighbor Georgia.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov played down concerns about the impact on relations with the United States.

"Our president has ... expressed hope many times that this will not affect the character of our relations," he said.

Snowden hopes to avoid the same fate as Bradley Manning, the U.S. Army soldier convicted on Tuesday on criminal charges including espionage and theft related to releasing classified data through WikiLeaks.

Nicaragua, Bolivia and Venezuela have offered Snowden refuge, but there are no direct commercial flights to Latin America from Moscow and he is concerned the United States would intercept any flight he takes.

Snowden also has received a marriage proposal via Twitter from Anna Chapman, the glamorous former agent who was deported to Russia from the United States in a Cold-War style spy swap in 2010.

Putin has said he wants to improve relations with the United States amid differences over the Syrian civil war, his treatment of political opponents and foreign-funded non-governmental organizations. He would have risked looking weak if he had handed Snowden over to the U.S. authorities.

More than half of Russians have a positive opinion of Snowden and 43 percent wanted him to be granted asylum, a poll released by independent research group Levada said this week.



headline: Accused theater gunman's dating website posting is evidence, judge rules
byline: By Keith Coffman
8:31am EDT

A question once posed by accused movie theater gunman James Holmes on a dating website, asking potential love interests, "Will you visit me in prison?" can be admitted as evidence at his murder trial, a Colorado judge ruled on Thursday.

The decision was a setback, but not an unexpected one, for Holmes, who faces the death penalty if convicted in the shooting deaths of 12 moviegoers at a suburban Denver cinema last summer during a screening of the Batman film "The Dark Knight Rises."

Prosecutors have charged Holmes, 25, with multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder for the rampage that also left two dozen others wounded or injured.

The former University of Colorado neuroscience graduate student has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Defense lawyers said in recent court filings their client was "in the throes of a psychotic episode" when he went on the shooting spree.

Prosecutors want to use the question Holmes posed on an online dating profile before the massacre to show that he was capable of distinguishing right from wrong, which could undermine his insanity defense.

Public defenders sought to have the prison visitation question - and other data investigators mined from two dating websites Holmes allegedly used - suppressed as irrelevant and prejudicial.

The statement should be inadmissible, they argued, because there is no way to establish what the question meant.

But Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour Jr. agreed with prosecutors that the statement's meaning was clear.

"(A) reasonable inference may be drawn that the user of the accounts posted the question because he anticipated doing something that he was aware would warrant prison time," the judge wrote.

Samour also said a photograph Holmes posted on one of the websites with his hair dyed red was also relevant for identification purposes since he had the distinctive hair color when he was arrested after the shootings.

While the ruling on the dating site question was a blow to the defense, it is no surprise the judge denied the motion, according to longtime Colorado defense lawyer Mark C. Johnson.

"Unless it's a statement made during a police interrogation, the legal standard for relevancy is relatively low," said Johnson, who has tried more than 100 felony cases.

Nor is it surprising that Holmes' lawyers would attempt to suppress as much evidence as they can, he said.

"In death penalty litigation, you raise every conceivable legal challenge because at stake is the very life of your client," Johnson said.

Holmes' trial is scheduled to begin in February.



headline: Talks resume to end Phoenix area bus strike
byline: By David Schwartz
8:31am EDT

Striking bus drivers and management in the Phoenix area resumed talks late on Thursday to end a strike that left some 57,000 weekday commuters scrambling to find rides to work during the morning rush hour.

The strike over pay and conditions shut down about 40 bus routes on Thursday including ones that serve the cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa and Tempe and others that reach Phoenix and Scottsdale.

Most bus routes were operating in Phoenix itself, which is served by a different company than First Transit, and the light rail system for the Phoenix Valley was not idled.

The Amalgamated Transit Union and First Transit, a company that operates on behalf of the Valley Metro public agency, have been embroiled in bitter talks since the beginning of the year to forge a labor contract for about 400 bus drivers.

"We are doing this (strike) because they refuse to bargain with us in good faith," Bob Bean, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1433, told Reuters. "The public needs to know that we would go back to work if they were fair to us."

Union leaders said the main sticking points were the company's attempt to gain greater control over workplace conditions and its ability to fire employees. Other areas of dispute include the firm's attempt to increase workers' healthcare contributions.

First Transit said talks to end the strike resumed on Thursday, and progress had been made. The firm said it had offered employees guaranteed salary increases ranging from 7 to 50 percent over three years, as well as healthcare concessions, although no settlement had been reached by late evening.

On Wednesday, union officials reported that 95 percent of its drivers had voted to reject First Transit's best-and-final offer. Another last-minute proposal by management failed to avert the strike, which went into effect at midnight.

A spokeswoman for First Transit could not immediately be reached for comment.

Scott Somers, Valley Metro chairman and a Mesa city councilman, said the union's decision to strike represents a major blow to "our most vulnerable neighbors."

Valley Metro urged commuters to consider alternatives such as car-pooling or working from home and urged patience from its riders.

Spokeswoman Susan Tierney said there have been discussions about implementing a skeleton service for affected riders, but that no decision has yet been made.

"We continue to look at a contingency plan," she said. "We do hope that this agreement can be finalized soon so we can get back to our regularly scheduled service."

martial is slated to begin.

Hasan, an American-born Muslim and U.S. Army major, is charged with opening fire on the Army post in Texas in November 2009, killing 13 people and wounding 32 others.

Two civilian Fort Hood police officers shot Hasan, ending the rampage and leaving the Army psychiatrist paralyzed from the chest down.

His trial was repeatedly delayed over procedural issues, such as whether he should be exempt from military grooming standards and allowed to keep his beard, which Hasan said he wears for religious reasons.

He is acting as his own attorney in his court-martial, scheduled to begin at the base on August 6. If convicted he could face execution or life in prison without parole.

Fox News said the documents, which it posted online, were furnished to the cable network at Hasan's request by his attorney for civil matters, John Galligan.

In an email reply to Reuters, Galligan verified that the documents delivered to the cable network were from Hasan, but he declined to answer any further questions. (Typed statement: <a href="http://r.reuters.com/neg22v">r.reuters.com/neg22v</a>)

One of the posted declarations, dated October 18, 2012, and written by hand, states that he is "compelled to renounce any oaths of allegiances that require me to support/defend any man made constitution (like the Constitution of the United States) over the commandments mandated in Islam." (Handwritten statement: <a href="http://r.reuters.com/meg22v">r.reuters.com/meg22v</a>)

It goes on to say: "I therefore formally renounce my oath of office as well as any other implicit or explicit oaths I have made in the past ... This includes my oath of U.S. citizenship."

Because Hasan, 42, is a native U.S. citizen, born in Arlington, Virginia, he would never have taken an oath of citizenship. And according to U.S. law, the type of written declaration posted online would have no legal force.

Federal law requires an individual wishing to renounce American citizenship to appear in person before a U.S. consular or diplomatic officer in a foreign country and sign an oath of renunciation, according to a U.S. State Department website.

The declarations on Thursday come five days after Hasan issued a separate public pronouncement through Fox News, a six-page statement in which he apologized for having participated in what he called "illegal and immoral aggression" against Muslims by serving in the U.S. military.

Hasan said at a pre-trial hearing that he opened fire at Fort Hood to protect Muslims and the Taliban in Afghanistan from U.S. assaults. The base is a major center for soldiers deployed to Afghanistan.



headline: Small manufacturers bet on Detroit brand despite bankruptcy
byline: By Nick Carey
8:31am EDT

For nearly six decades Detroit's story has been one of relentless erosion of its once mighty manufacturing base, but even as the Motor City faces a long bankruptcy a clutch of small producers has moved in to rekindle the "Made in Detroit" brand.

Making products ranging from bicycles to luxury watches and "sleeping bag" coats designed for the homeless, these small firms have tapped into a surprising amount of demand for goods made in a city more commonly associated today with failure and decline.

"Our customers come from all walks of life and are looking for a little bit of soul and something that is authentically Detroit," said Eric Yelsma, founder of Detroit Denim Co., which produces hand-made jeans. "We can't make them fast enough."

Unlike deep-pocketed Dan Gilbert, co-founder of online mortgage provider Quicken Loans who has helped spur a downtown boom here by moving in 9,000 employees and spending $1 billion in the process, Detroit's new entrepreneurs are winging it.

"None of us have ever done this before," said Zak Pashak, who has invested $2 million in Detroit Bikes, which will start production of its "urban bike" model in August and aims to build 40,000 bicycles a year.

"We just jumped in with both feet," said Pashak, who started out as a bar owner in his native Calgary and wound up in Detroit, a city he had admired since childhood for its Motown music. "America needs jobs, which is a good reason to start making stuff here again."

Detroit's manufacturing startups have yet to have much impact on a city unemployment rate that stood at 11.7 percent in June. As a whole, they have created only a few hundred jobs, just a fraction of the 7,700 manufacturing jobs created in the sector from March 2012 to March 2013 in the Detroit metropolitan area, according government data.

Small as they are, Detroit's manufacturing startups offer faint signs of economic diversification after decades of reliance on the automakers or grand schemes to revitalize Detroit such as casinos. They are also making relatively expensive niche goods in a city where consumer spending power has been battered for years.

"I think these small firms offer better hope for Detroit than any big answer," said Margaret Dewar, an urban planning professor at the University of Michigan. "The city has always looked for a big solution to its problems, which hasn't worked."

The auto industry built Detroit, drawing hundreds of thousands of jobs here. But as U.S. automakers shifted production elsewhere, the city's population fell from a peak of 1.8 million in 1950 to around 700,000, and only one large-volume auto plant still makes cars in the city. Detroit has long-term debt of more than $18 billion and on July 18 the state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection, the largest ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy.

"LOOKING TO THE FUTURE"

Detroit's new entrepreneurs have come despite the city's strained finances, undaunted by the lack of street lights in many neighborhoods and patchy basic services like police and emergency services.

"Most of the people who have set up here are family and friends who have done so regardless of poor services," said David Egner, executive director of the New Economy Initiative, a $100 million fund to aid entrepreneurs in Detroit.

They are encouraged by Orr's plans to invest in services and infrastructure as part of the city's restructuring. "Once services improve, I think we'll see growth from companies outside that group of family and friends," Egner said.

The largest of the city's small newcomers is a watch maker called Shinola, a Depression-era brand name purchased in 2011 when the company set up shop. Dallas-based Bedrock Manufacturing, a venture capital firm backed by Tom Kartsotis, founder of accessory firm Fossil Inc., decided to take advantage of Detroit's underutilized workforce and resonant Made-in-America mystique.

"When we came here we found a lot of dynamic young people who were not focused on Detroit's past, but were looking to the future," said Bedrock CEO Heath Carr. "There is a movement in the United States for Made in America goods, but our question was would they support it with their wallets, because most things made here are more expensive."

Recent consumer research, including a November 2012 Boston Consulting Group survey, indicates around 80 percent of U.S. respondents are willing to pay a premium for American-made goods.

Bedrock spent an undisclosed sum on equipment and on months of training for workers to assemble Shinola watches in a clean environment not far from downtown Detroit. The parts mostly come from Switzerland or China, but the company has two certified watchmakers on staff who can modify designs.

"It means a lot to me to be able to make these watches here in Detroit," said Jalil Kizy, a Detroit native and one of Shinola's two watchmakers. Until Shinola came along, Kizy was like many Michigan natives who have felt they would need to leave the state to find work.

Shinola's 75-person workforce has the capacity to produce 500,000 watches a year. The first batch of 2,500 watches, priced from $475 to $800 each, sold out in days early this year to buyers across the United States. The company has had teething problems delivering products, Carr said, in part because Shinola underestimated demand.

"It's a good problem to have," Carr said. "But we are working to manage customer expectations."

Shinola also assembles Shinola bikes here, competing with at least two other small-scale bike makers: Detroit Bicycle Company and custom bike builder Slingshot Bikes, which is relocating from Grand Rapids in western Michigan. Pashak's Detroit Bikes will employ 30 people when production begins in August.

"CRAZY OLD"

The city's new manufacturers face challenges common to many new businesses: managing consumer expectations while struggling to meet demand, finding qualified workers to ramp up production, or bearing the cost of training new ones.

Eric Yelsma formed Detroit Denim after losing his job selling specialty printing chemicals once oil hit $100 a barrel in 2008. Yelsma wants to expand Detroit Denim's four-person payroll, but few Americans know how to make jeans anymore.

"The labor pool for this business is pretty much minimal," he said. "So far, we've come up dry."

A local veterans' group is considering a plan to fund a six-month training course for three veterans to become "jean smiths" on what Yelsma describes as "crazy old" sewing machines, one more than a century old. Detroit Denim's jeans sell for $250.

Detroit Denim shares space with the non-profit Empowerment Plan, which makes sleeping bag coats for the homeless. Backed by Quicken Loans' Gilbert and Spanx founder Sara Blakely, Empowerment Plan makes coats from donated materials - insulation from General Motors and material from workwear brand Carhartt.

Veronika Scott, a 24-year-old graduate of Detroit's College for Creative Studies who founded Empowerment Plan, said most of the nine formerly homeless women she employs have found places to live since getting a job. Demand for the coats is strong enough that Scott is planning a "buy one, give one" program this fall: for $200, customers will get a coat and have one donated to a homeless person.

Andrew Pierce, U.S. president of marketing consultancy Prophet, said Detroit's new manufacturers are tapping into Detroit's reputation much as U.S. automaker Chrysler has with its "Imported from Detroit" commercials.

"The Detroit brand is very authentic and a little bit gritty in a good way," Pierce said. Beyond a growing desire for American-made goods, the attraction of Detroit "is that part of the American dream is all about the rebuild out of a crisis."



headline: Illinois businessman pays insurance settlement in quarters
byline: By Mary Wisniewski
8:31am EDT

A prominent Illinois businessman who disagreed with the outcome of an insurance payout after the death of his son paid a portion of the final legal settlement in thousands of pounds of quarters, an attorney involved in the case said on Thursday.

Attorney Douglas Dorris confirmed that Roger Herrin arrived at his law firm on Wednesday with 75 bags, each containing 4,000 quarters, weighing 48 pounds each, for a total of $75,000, as part of the settlement payment. The firm had to hire a Brinks truck to haul away the bags of coins and count them.

Herrin, 76, a retired podiatrist whose company owns three nursing homes, is a member of the Southern Illinois University board of trustees and has served on other state government boards, including the Illinois Finance Authority.

In June of 2001, Roger Herrin's teenage son, Michael, was a passenger in a Jeep Cherokee when it was struck by a truck running a stop sign, according to court records.

Michael Herrin was thrown out of the Jeep and killed, and two other teens, Jared Head and Ross Duncan, were injured. The driver, Duncan's mother, was also injured.

Michael Herrin's estate had $5.5 million in various forms of insurance coverage, according to court records. Roger Herrin accepted on behalf of his son's estate a settlement offer of $1.65 million.

The insurance policy for the Jeep's owner provided another $800,000 in coverage for all the accident victims, and the truck's insurance provided $100,000 more.

Roger Herrin, as administrator of his son's estate, claimed he was due the lion's share of those funds, too, and a judge agreed, awarding an additional payout of $677,851 to Herrin.

But an appellate court found that under Illinois law, Herrin's estate was not entitled to money from the Jeep owner's insurance because it had received a much larger payout already. The survivors from the Jeep accident had over $900,000 in claims, according to court records.

Ultimately, a settlement was reached by which Herrin had to pay back money to the other accident victims.

Herrin was not immediately available for comment. However, he told the Southern Illinoisan newspaper that the settlement payment in the case was "vehemently wrong" and that losing a child "leaves a hole in your heart that is never repairable."

The newspaper reported the amount Herrin had to return came to roughly $500,000, though the total sum could not be independently confirmed by Reuters.

Dorris, the attorney for Head, said he believed the decisions followed the law, although Herrin "obviously is very upset with the opinions and rulings of the appellate court.

"On the other hand, I have no desire to criticize a man who has lost a son," Dorris said. "I can understand him being very upset." An attorney for the other survivors was not immediately available for comment.

based push to see him reinstated.

The petition drive in support of English instructor Ken Bencomo on the online petition platform Change.org has gathered over 9,000 signatures from his former students and people as far away as Spain since it was launched earlier this week.

The teacher and his partner were among a wave of same-sex couples who married after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June cleared the way for gay weddings to resume in California for the first time since 2008.

If Bencomo sues, his attorney, Patrick McGarrigle, sees it as a potential test case of legal protections some religious institutions assert they have in hiring and firing based on principles of faith.

Bencomo taught at the all-girls St. Lucy's Priory High School in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendora for over 16 years, but was terminated in July, a little more than a week after marrying his longtime partner, McGarrigle said on Thursday.

Brittany Littleton, 23, a former student at St. Lucy's, is leading the online petition, which asks administrators to "reverse this act of prejudice" against her former teacher and "give him his job back."

A Beverly Hills resident and yoga instructor, Littleton said her drive was not meant to tear down St. Lucy's, which she described as pushing students to be "forward thinking."

"It's as much a fight for the school as it is for Mr. Bencomo, but we want them to know we do not stand by this decision and are horrified by it," Littleton said.

Raised Catholic, Bencomo, 45, chaired the school's English department, helped with the yearbook and served as a dance coach, McGarrigle said. School administrators were aware he was in a same-sex relationship, the attorney said.

But just over a week after his July 1 wedding was written up in the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, an administrator told Bencomo he was being let go because his marriage was "in public and violated the church's teaching," McGarrigle said.

Sister Helen Dziuk, an assistant principal at St. Lucy's, declined to comment, saying the Benedictine institution wished to "protect the privacy of everyone involved" and that the matter "may involve litigation."

The school later issued a statement saying that while St. Lucy's "does not discriminate against teachers or other school employees based on their private lifestyle choices, public displays of behavior that are directly contrary to church teachings are inconsistent with these values."

It added, "These values are incorporated into the contractual obligations of each of our instructors and other employees."

POPE'S VIEW

The Archdiocese of Los Angeles declined to comment on the grounds that the school is privately run and not under its jurisdiction.

Pope Francis, who was elected in March, told reporters this week on a flight from Brazil that gays should be integrated into society, but that homosexual acts were a sin.

McGarrigle said his client wished to settle out of court, but could file a lawsuit. He said such a case, based in part on the fact that Bencomo's homosexuality had been tolerated at school, may become a legal test of what protections religious institutions have in firing an employee for a same-sex marriage.

Thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia now allow same-sex unions, with Minnesota and Rhode Island joining that group on Thursday.

"Clearly, he (Bencomo) was terminated because he engaged in a lawful act that the school now believes - or at least asserts - was one step too far," McGarrigle said.

Karl Manheim, a Loyola Law School professor, said a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling found that religious institutions could not exempt lay employees from workplace protections.

"To the extent that the church is involved in ordinary business operations, and running a school typically is, they're going to be subject to state and federal statutes," he said.



headline: Even when jobs return, Detroit's workers fall short on skills
byline: By Nick Carey
8:31am EDT

Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr has a long list of things to fix in the city and among them is one that may sound surprising: there are not enough skilled workers to fill job openings as they become available.

"Every problem in this city revolves around jobs," said Lindsay Chalmers, vice president of non-profit Goodwill Industries of Greater Detroit. "That's at the heart of the issue for Detroit."

The decline of manufacturing jobs, above all in the automotive industry, has played a major role in the slide of the Motor City's population to 700,000 from a peak of 1.8 million in the 1950s. Despite recent gains, Michigan has 350,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than in 2000.

Seismic shifts in the local labor market have left many unskilled workers behind.

"In the old days you could graduate on Friday, get hired at the Ford plant on Monday and they'd train you," said Sheldon Danziger, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. "But in Detroit as in other manufacturing cities, employers are demanding that workers come to jobs with more skills than they used to have."

There are jobs on the horizon for Detroit, with some $8 billion in potential infrastructure investments including a light rail line and a new bridge to Canada, which alone is expected to generate 25,000 jobs. Once these projects begin, they are expected to fuel a surge in service-related jobs.

But Pamela Moore, chief executive of Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation (DESC), a non-profit focused on retraining the city's unemployed, said Detroit's labor force is unprepared for the jobs that may be coming.

"The question is whether we can prepare a lot of people in Detroit for those jobs," Moore said. "Right now, a lot of them don't have the necessary skills."

"SETTING THEM UP FOR FAILURE"

Detroit's official unemployment rate topped 11 percent in June, well above the national rate of 7.6 percent for that month. Taking into account people who have given up looking for work or may never have worked, unofficial estimates put the jobless rate at well over 20 percent.

Public-sector efforts at job training have shown scant results. After then-governor Jennifer Granholm established a $500 million job training program in 2007, roughly $100 million was spent in Detroit through 2010, but few got jobs because so few positions were available, said Jose Reyes, chief operating officer of the DESC job training agency.

"In many ways, we set them up for failure," Reyes said.

The not-for-profit sector is trying to step in. Goodwill Industries has formed businesses in Detroit that it uses to train workers. An automotive supply business fills orders for Ford, Chrysler and GM, and a company called Green Works strips down power generators, mostly from local power company DTE Energy, for copper and other metals that it sells to customers.

"We cannot do everything for the folks here, but we can get them on the bottom rung of the economic ladder," said Green Works president Jay Wilber.

Kim Allen, 47, served two 10-year prison terms including for second-degree murder before landing a temporary, part-time job with Green Works in 2011. Now a permanent employee, she aims to take a welding course Green Works offers.

"This job has given me an opportunity we ex-cons usually don't get," she said. "Now it's time to keep moving up."

DESC's Moore said many Detroiters lack "soft skills" such as showing up for work, or even staying off cell phones during job interviews. In some cases, she said, "no one in their families has worked for two generations."

In the last three years, Detroit has cut the city workforce by more than 2,700 workers, to 9,560.

Jim Jacobs, president of Macomb Community College in the Detroit suburb of Warren, said Detroit's chief labor problem remains a lack of demand.

At Detroit's high unemployment levels, employers in the Detroit area can "afford to be picky," Jacobs said.

"Workers here often need training for new skills, but why should an employer bother doing that when there are thousands of workers to choose from?" he said.



headline: Accused Fort Hood gunman appears to renounce U.S. allegiance ahead of trial
byline: By Lisa Maria Garza
8:31am EDT

martial is slated to begin, in which says he wishes to renounce his U.S. citizenship and military oath.

Hasan, an American-born Muslim and U.S. Army major, is charged with opening fire on the Army post in Texas in November 2009, killing 13 soldiers and wounding 32 people.

He is acting as his own attorney in his court-martial, scheduled to begin at the base on August 6. If convicted he could face execution or life in prison without parole.

Fox News said the documents, which it posted online, were furnished to the cable network at Hasan's request by his attorney for civil matters, John Galligan.

The lawyer was quoted by Fox as vouching for the authenticity of the documents and the signature.

In an email reply to Reuters, Galligan verified that the documents delivered to the cable network were from Hasan, but he declined to answer any further questions.

One of the posted declarations, dated October 18, 2012 and written by hand, states that he is "compelled to renounce any oaths of allegiances that require me to support/defend any man made constitution (like the Constitution of the United States) over the commandments mandated in Islam."

It goes on to say: "I therefore formally renounce my oath of office as well as any other implicit or explicit oaths I have made in the past ... This includes my oath of U.S. citizenship."

Because Hasan, 42, is a native U.S. citizen, born in Arlington, Virginia, he would never have taken an oath of citizenship. And the written declaration posted online has no legal force.

U.S. law requires an individual wishing to renounce American citizenship to appear in person before a U.S. consular or diplomatic officer in a foreign country and sign an oath of renunciation.

The declarations on Thursday come five days after Hasan issued a separate public pronouncement through Fox News, a six-page statement in which he apologized for having participated in what he called "illegal and immoral aggression" against Muslims by serving in the U.S. military.



headline: Duke Energy shelves major nuclear project in Florida
byline: By David Adams
8:31am EDT

Duke Energy Corp said on Thursday it will not proceed with a $24 billion nuclear power project in central Florida because of licensing delays and doubts about cost recovery, but may use the site for nuclear power generation in the future.

The announcement was the latest blow to nuclear power investment in the Sunshine State and reflected the boom in natural gas development nationwide.

Although it is pulling the plug on plans to build a nuclear plant in Florida's Levy County, the company said it continues to regard the Gulf Coast site as a "viable option for future nuclear generation."

"We continue to believe that a balanced energy portfolio, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and state-of-the-art cleaner power plants are critical to securing Florida's energy future," Alex Glenn, president of Duke Energy's utility operations in the state, said in a statement.

He cited delays in the licensing of new plants by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as uncertainties about cost recovery, as among leading reasons plans to build the plant had been put on hold.

"Nuclear energy should remain an option to meet Florida's future energy needs," said Glenn.

Duke Energy Florida provides electricity to approximately 1.7 million customers in Florida.

Duke Energy, the biggest power company in the United States, announced in February that its Progress Energy Florida utility would retire the Crystal River nuclear plant on the state's west coast.

The plant had been offline since late 2009 due to damage done to the reactor's containment structure during a power upgrade and the replacement of the unit's steam generators.

The Levy project decision was welcomed by critics of nuclear energy in Florida. "Duke's leadership has taken a fresh look at these unnecessary nuclear projects and has absolutely made the right decision for Florida consumers," said Stephen A. Smith, executive director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

"While important details are still being resolved, Florida consumers should rejoice in knowing that the fleecing associated with this nuclear project will end," he added, noting that the Levy project cost had "skyrocketed."

Duke said it will continue the process to obtain a license to build the plant, but in the meantime it plans to seek to construct or acquire natural gas-fired power generation.

"It is encouraging to see Duke recognize the value of nuclear energy by keeping its options open for this site," said Jerry Paul, a Florida-based nuclear engineer with the Energy Information Institute. "Most experts would agree that zero-emission nuclear energy must play a role in America's and Florida's future energy supply," he added.

Paul said the Levy decision appeared to be based on a narrow set of factors related to Duke's Florida territory, including electricity demand projections and the timeline for available energy from that plant compared with the delays in the permitting process.

There are currently 100 reactors licensed to operate in the United States. The reactors have a total capacity of about 97,843 megawatts (MW) and generate about 20 percent of the nation's power.

In February Duke said it was evaluating the potential to build a new gas plant that could come online as early as 2018.

In 2012, before the merger with Duke, Progress said it delayed the proposed in-service date for the Levy county nuclear power plant to 2024 with a second unit following 18 months later. The company also boosted the cost estimate for the 2,200-MW project to between $19 billion and $24 billion.



headline: Pentagon downplays prospects of cancelling F-35, bomber
byline: By Andrea Shalal-Esa
8:31am EDT

35 fighter and a new stealth bomber, after leaked documents from a budget review suggested the programs might be eliminated as one way to deal with deep budget cuts.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Wednesday that finding $500 billion in budget cuts required by law over the next decade, on top of $487 billion in cuts already being implemented, required tough trade-offs between the size of the military and high-end weapons programs.

Pentagon briefing slides shown to various groups mapped out those tradeoffs in stark terms, indicating that a decision to maintain a larger military could result in the cancellation of the $392 billion Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 program and a new stealthy, long-range bomber, according to several people who saw the slides.

Defense officials later stressed there were no plans to kill either program, noting that dismantling the F-35 program in particular would have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. military services and 10 foreign countries involved in the program, which is already in production.

"We have gone to great lengths to stress that this review identified, through a rigorous process of strategic modeling, possible decisions we might face, under scenarios we may or may not face in the future," Pentagon Spokesman George Little told Reuters in an email when asked about the slides.

"Any suggestion that we're now moving away from key modernization programs as a result of yesterday's discussion of the outcomes of the review would be incorrect," he said.

Analysts said Hagel and other Pentagon officials appeared to be leaning toward the option that would emphasize high-end weapons programs over force size.

Mackenzie Eaglen, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said suggestions that the F-35 program "was being targeted was either an oversight or a scare tactic, but it wasn't a serious proposition that the entire program would be cancelled under any circumstances."

She said failure by Congress to reverse deep budget cuts could result in the F-35 program being slowed or scaled back, but outright cancellation was unlikely given the huge investment already made in the new warplane, which is designed to replace over a dozen planes in use around the world.

One defense official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the budget document had sketched out a worst-case scenario that was highly unlikely to occur.

"Cancelling the program would be detrimental to our national defense," said the official, noting that the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps needed to replace aging fleets of fighter planes that were increasingly expensive to maintain.

Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute, cited estimates that it would cost four times the amount needed to buy new F-35s to keep the current force flying. And cutting the planned bomber would generate very little savings since the program - which could eventually cost around $30 billion - is in the early stages at this point, he said.

"You have to view these options as analytical excursions rather than serious proposals because they're not consistent with what the administration has said it wants to do," he said.

Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall and top U.S. military officials have repeatedly underscored their commitment to the F-35 program in recent months.

On Thursday, Admiral James Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a House Armed Services Committee that early work to develop a new long-range bomber was on track, and the new bomber would be a vital part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent and potential future warfare concepts.

But he said deepening budget cuts under the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 could threaten the ambitious schedule for the new bomber, which Air Force officials want to field by 2025 -- and potentially the whole program.

"It could impact that program in terms of timing," Winnefeld told lawmakers. "It also would depend a little bit on whether you emphasized capacity or capability in terms of how many you might buy or - or whether you would do the program."

Details are classified, but industry officials and analysts said Lockheed, Northrop Grumman Corp, and Boeing Co have been awarded small-scale study contracts to start working on possible bomber designs, with a formal acquisition process to begin in coming years.

The Air Force requested $400 million in its fiscal 2014 budget request for what it is trying to keep an affordable program. It plans to spend up to $550 million each to buy 80 to 100 new bombers in coming years, with an eye to fielding them in the mid-2020s, said spokesman Ed Gulick.

Jim Thomas, vice president at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the two options of a smaller military or sharp cutback in weapons programs represented a false dichotomy.

"This is almost one reasonably attractive option and a straw man that looks pretty unattractive," he said. "I don't think we're going to end up at either of these corners on the map. I think that you're going to get a hybrid solution."



headline: After Snowden, no business as usual for U.S. and Russia
byline: By Matt Spetalnick and Susan Cornwell
8:31am EDT

After causing weeks of embarrassment for the U.S. intelligence community, the Edward Snowden saga has now cast a shadow over international efforts to end the Syrian civil war and deal with Iran, and could also undermine White House hopes for a nuclear arms reduction deal.

Russia's decision on Thursday to grant asylum to Snowden threatens to send already-strained relations between the United States and Russia to the lowest point in years and further complicate efforts to work out geopolitical challenges.

With Russia's sheltering of the former U.S. spy agency contractor seen as a slap in the face to President Barack Obama, the White House is weighing whether he should now back out of a Moscow summit in early September, in a direct snub to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The fact that Washington is even issuing such a threat underscores the potentially damaging repercussions for any prospects of reconciling the two former Cold War rivals on thorny global issues that go well beyond the fate of a single 30-year-old hacker trying to evade U.S. prosecution, analysts say.

The two men are highly unlikely to sort out all their many differences even if the summit goes ahead as planned. They have bad personal chemistry and previous meetings have been awkward and unproductive.

While the Kremlin played down any bilateral friction, Obama administration officials and top lawmakers suggested it would not be business as usual now that Russia has given Snowden a year's asylum and allowed him to leave Moscow's airport after more than five weeks in limbo.

"The political climate in Washington on Russia is poisonous," said Andrew Weiss, a former Russia adviser to President Bill Clinton. "There was already plenty of anger toward Russia brewing in the political establishment. Snowden is an accelerant."

The long list of U.S. differences with Russia is topped by Moscow's support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war even as Obama has led international calls for him to step aside.

Worsened ties between the United States and Russia could now make it even more difficult for them to cooperate in arranging Syrian peace talks aimed at a political solution.

With Iran about to install newly elected President Hassan Rouhani, who has signaled greater willingness to negotiate over its disputed nuclear program, there are also concerns in Washington that Russia may break ranks with Western countries seeking to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions through tough sanctions.

DEEPLY AT ODDS

On human rights, the United States and Russia remain deeply at odds. The White House has been mostly measured in its criticism of the Kremlin's crackdown on opponents, but it may now feel freer to be more outspoken in the aftermath of the Snowden decision.

For his part, Putin has used Washington's pursuit of Snowden, who faces U.S. espionage charges for revealing National Security Agency surveillance secrets, to accuse the Obama administration of hypocrisy for chiding him on human rights.

Tensions over Snowden are also likely to make it harder for Obama to push forward on negotiations for a new nuclear arms reduction deal with Russia, a proposal he issued in a speech in Berlin in June and which he hopes to make part of his legacy. Russia so far has shown little appetite for the idea.

Though counterterrorism has emerged as a rare bright spot in relations, especially in the aftermath of April's Boston Marathon bombings, this too could suffer. White House spokesman Jay Carney said pointedly that the Russian decision on Snowden "undermines a long history of law enforcement cooperation."

Even before Snowden, the consensus in Washington and Moscow was that the "reset" in ties with Russia that the newly elected Obama touted in 2009 had run its course.

But Obama's critics say the return to the presidency of Putin and his anti-U.S. rhetoric has shown that the U.S. leader was naive to put his faith in Moscow. They point to the Snowden decision as a rebuke that calls for a tough response and say it is one more foreign policy failure at a time when Obama struggles to assert influence in crises sweeping Syria and Egypt.

"Unless we want to remain in the position of someone who is insulted and demeaned, sooner or later those in Washington who want Russia to pay the price for this chain of insults will prevail," said Ariel Cohen, a senior research fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

The Obama administration must now decide how far it wants to go in demonstrating its anger. But its options may be limited, especially at a time when Washington needs continued use of Russian territory for its withdrawal from Afghanistan and still hopes for Russian diplomatic cooperation against Iran.

Obama's first major decision is whether to go ahead with a one-on-one summit with Putin in Moscow next month.

Scrapping the meeting might not antagonize Russia too badly. But it would be a different story if Obama decides not to attend the Putin-hosted summit of G20 leaders in St. Petersburg shortly afterwards - something considered unlikely.

Some U.S. lawmakers have called for a U.S. boycott of the Winter Olympics that Russia will host in Sochi next February, but that is also seen as a step too far for the White House.

Despite increased strains, no one is predicting a rupture in relations between Washington and Moscow. Many believe the two sides will go through a period of drift but ultimately find a way to "compartmentalize" their disagreements and move on.

"Neither side wants an antagonistic relationship. That would just make the world a more dangerous place," said James Goldgeier, dean of the School of International Service at American University in Washington.



headline: Federal judge dismisses states' challenge to Dodd-Frank law
byline: By Casey Sullivan
8:31am EDT

Frank financial reform act, which had been brought by a group that included a small bank and 11 state attorneys general.

Judge Ellen Huvelle of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the lawsuit brought last year by State National Bank of Big Springs, Texas, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the 60 Plus Association and 11 state attorneys general.

The plaintiffs challenged Titles I, II and X of Dodd-Frank, which established financial oversight units, such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Orderly Liquidation Authority and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The plaintiffs argued that the State National Bank, with less than $300 million in assets, would suffer because of rules the CFPB writes to police mortgages and other consumer products the bank offers.

The bank also targeted the FSOC, a coalition of regulators called for in Dodd-Frank to study risk in the financial system. The lawsuit argued that the FSOC's designation of certain banks as "systematically important" to the banking system would raise borrowing costs for smaller banks.

In another allegation, the bank said that the increased regulatory scrutiny prompted it to spend more than $230,000 in compliance costs in 2012, including classes on CFPB regulations and a subscription to a service called "Compliance Alliance" created by Texas Bankers Association in response to the passage of Dodd-Frank.

But Judge Huvelle said: "The Bank's assertion that it was forced to expend these costs rings hollow since it is not clear that (compliance venders) provide needed information about Bureau regulations that is not readily accessible from the Bureau's ... website."

The state plaintiffs, which included Michigan, South Carolina and Nebraska, challenged the portion of the Dodd-Frank law that empowered the Treasury secretary to order a liquidation of a financial company whose collapse may threaten the stability of the banking system.

The states had claimed that because their pension funds were creditors of financial institutions, and if those institutions were liquidated on orders by the FSOC rather than through bankruptcy, then they could be treated unfairly.

Huvelle dismissed the entire case on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing and did not show that they had been injured as a result of Dodd-Frank.

Huvelle called the case "unusual" because the plaintiffs had not faced "any adverse rulings nor has agency action been directed at them."

"Most significantly, no enforcement action - 'the paradigm of direct governmental authority' - has been taken against plaintiffs.'

Plaintiffs and government lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

headline: Obama to nominate Deborah Lee James as Air Force secretary
headline: Obama open to making changes to surveillance, lawmakers say
byline: By Mark Felsenthal and Patricia Zengerle
8:31am EDT

President Barack Obama on Thursday told lawmakers he is open to changing controversial surveillance programs in order to restore public confidence and provide assurance the government is not violating citizens' privacy, participants at the meeting said.

"We understand the American people really do need to know what's going on now and what's going on in the past and get the right kind of assurances that their privacy has not been breached," said Senator Saxby Chambliss, who attended the meeting.

"We've got to figure out ways to make the program more transparent," he said.

Since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread government collection of phone and Internet records, a debate has erupted over how far the government should be allowed to go in monitoring its citizens' communications to protect the country from attacks.

Opposition to government surveillance has created an unlikely alliance of libertarian Republicans and some Democrats in Congress. The House of Representatives last week narrowly defeated an amendment to a spending bill that would have limited the NSA's scope to collect electronic information.

Obama met at the White House with Chambliss and other lawmakers who sit on the intelligence and judiciary committees. These included Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, who has been a skeptic of the NSA data collection program, and Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee on which Chambliss is the top Republican.

Also present were Representative Mike Rogers, who chairs the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, and Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the panel.

The White House said the president had called the meeting to discuss the surveillance program and "to hear from some of the programs' most prominent critics and defenders."

The intelligence committee leaders said in a joint statement they intend to work through August on proposals to increase transparency and protect privacy in counterterrorism programs.

At the White House, the discussion focused on the need to amend, but not necessarily abolish, the surveillance program, and to explain its merits to those who worry it is an invasion of privacy, Chambliss told reporters.

"We don't know what type of changes we're going to make," he said. "But the president was very amenable for providing the right kind of leadership to ensure that we get together and that we do the right thing."

The chairman of the House Judiciary panel, Republican Bob Goodlatte, who was also at the meeting, said he plans to hold hearings to ensure that the surveillance does not infringe on civil liberties.

"I stressed to the president that Congress must ensure that the laws we have enacted are executed in a manner that is consistent with congressional intent and that protects both our national security and our civil liberties," he said in a statement.

A small group of senators unveiled two bills before the White House meeting on Thursday seeking to alter the surveillance programs.

One measure would create a new "special advocate" position who could argue in a court that operates in secret to make decisions on government surveillance requests, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

The other would change the way judges are appointed to the FISA courts to ensure that the court represents a broad spectrum of political views.

byline: By Marice Richter

The Texas Department of Public Safety said on Thursday it had withdrawn a subpoena for information from Twitter regarding two tweets about conservative Texas lawmakers, including Governor Rick Perry, and the passage of restrictive abortion regulations.

The department had sought information, documents and records related to the Twitter accounts of Denise Romano of Austin and Michael Mayer of New York in an investigation into their tweets between July 17 and 19, the day before and after Perry signed the abortion bill into law.

Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Tom Vinger confirmed in an email that the subpoena had been withdrawn and said the department "will continue to investigate potential threats against public officials."

The tweets were directed at Perry and other Texas lawmakers in response to the ban on abortions in the state after 20 weeks of pregnancy and to new regulations on abortion providers.

One of the tweets on July 18 posted by Romano said, "Should we execute Perry by lethal injection or stoning for all he's killed." That post was retweeted by Mayer.

Both Mayer and Romano received support from their followers on Twitter, who expressed dismay that social media comments could be construed as a threat.

"We are pleased," said Romano's attorney Michelle Kostun, who added that the matter concerning her client is closed.

"We commend Twitter on its commitment to protecting user information and content," she added.

Twitter spokesman Jim Prosser said the social media outlet would not "confirm or comment" on the subpoena.



headline: Detroit slashes pay for some police, firefighter unions
byline: By Joseph Lichterman
8:31am EDT

About 1,200 Detroit police lieutenants and sergeants and about 400 Detroit firefighters will see a 10 percent pay cut in their paychecks on September 16, a spokesman for Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr said on Thursday.

The city informed the Detroit Police Lieutenants and Sergeants Association (LSA) and the Detroit Firefighters Association of the pay cut along with a reduction in benefits on Wednesday.

The Detroit Police Lieutenants and Sergeants Association's contract was slated to be terminated on July 6, but the city extended the contract for 30 days.

Orr's spokesman, Bill Nowling, said the contract was extended to give new Detroit Police Chief James Craig, who started July 1, "an opportunity to get his feet on the ground."

The firefighter union's contract expired June 30, but the 400 affected firefighters - lieutenants, sergeants and captains - have parity with the Lieutenants and Sergeants Association, so their contract was also subject to the delay.

Nowling said the city notified the unions in June that the cuts would occur once the contracts expired. He said the city will take 30 days to process the changes into its payroll system.

The pay cuts will mean police lieutenants will be paid about $7,000 less and sergeants will earn about $6,000 less, said Mark Young, president of the LSA.

"We understand that the city is in financial distress," Young said. "The past leadership of the city government drove us here, but we were hoping that the hardship wouldn't be so great on the men and women that I represent that haven't had a raise in four and a half years."

Aside from the pay cut, the new contract also makes changes to sick leave accrual, overtime payments and paid time off.

Detroit Mayor Dave Bing implemented the same cuts last August for patrol officers and most firefighters. Non-uniformed city employees also took a 10 percent pay cut at that time.

The cuts will save the city $4.5 million annually, Nowling said. The unions hope to meet with the city to discuss the changes, Young said, but Nowling noted the changes are already adopted in the city's fiscal year 2014 budget.



headline: Firefighter killed battling blaze in Pacific Northwest
byline: By Teresa Carson
8:31am EDT

One firefighter was killed and another injured on Thursday while battling a wildfire in central Oregon, one of several blazes that have blackened hundreds of square miles of terrain across the Pacific Northwest.

A tree fell on the firefighters at about 9 a.m. local time as they worked to contain a lightning-sparked fire in the Deschutes National Forest, the U.S. Forest Service said.

Both men, who have not been identified, were contract tree fellers. Crews responded to the accident and the survivor was transported to a local area hospital for treatment for unspecified injuries, the service said in a statement.

The current fire season has been particularly deadly in the U.S. West. Nineteen Arizona firefighters died in June after they became trapped by a wind-whipped inferno, and two people perished after being caught in a blaze in neighboring Colorado.

Several large forest fires already raging in Oregon and neighboring Washington grew overnight to around 220 square miles from 190 square miles on Wednesday, and more resources were committed to the blazes.

A pall of smoke from a cluster of menacing wildfires in Southwestern Oregon, shut down outdoor performances at the renowned Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, while a 35-mile stretch of the Rogue River was closed to river rafters.

Flames from the Big Windy Fire, a conflagration made up of three lighting-sparked fires last Friday, reached the banks of the Rogue River, fire spokesman Jim Whittington, said. He warned conditions for rafters were unsafe as crews hoped to use helicopters to dip into the river for water.

"Also if there is an accident or medical emergency, with roads closed, we can't get in there to rescue people in the normal ways," he said.

More than 100 homes are under evacuation orders from the Douglas Complex Fire in the southwest part of the state, which has torched 44.5 square miles and was only 7 percent contained. Some 545 structures are threatened.

In neighboring Washington state, some 1,700 firefighters worked to contain two fires that have together charred 132 square miles east of the Cascade Range, destroying at least three homes and several out-buildings, said state Emergency Management Division spokesman Mark Clemens.

The so-called Colockum Tarps fire, which broke out on Saturday morning and spread quickly through dry brush near Malaga, had burned over some 93 square miles of tree-covered mountain slopes toward the Columbia River by Wednesday afternoon, Clemens said.



headline: Long Island woman says cooking searches stirred suspicion
byline: By Edith Honan
8:31am EDT

A Long Island writer struggling to find a better way to cook lentils was visited by law enforcement agents after she and her husband ran Google searches on pressure cookers and backpacks, she wrote in a blog post.

Those items were a deadly combination on April 15 at the Boston Marathon, when two brothers planted pressure cookers filled with explosives hidden in backpacks near the finish line, setting off blasts that killed three people and injured nearly 300 - in some cases, severing limbs.

For Michele Catalano, who wrote about her experience on the Medium.com website on Thursday, a day after the incident, the searches created "a perfect storm of terrorism profiling." Catalano also told her story to the Guardian newspaper on Thursday, but was not immediately available for an interview.

"I had researched pressure cookers. My husband was looking for a backpack. And maybe in another time those two things together would have seemed innocuous, but we are in 'these times' now," Catalano wrote.

The Suffolk County police department told a different story.

In an email sent to reporters on Thursday, the police said criminal intelligence detectives got a tip from a computer company that a former employee had conducted suspicious searches on a workplace computer. The searches included "pressure cooker bombs" and "backpacks."

"Suffolk County Police Detectives visited the subject's home to ask about the suspicious Internet searches," and the incident was ruled "non-criminal in nature," according to the statement.

Spokesmen for the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Nassau County Police Department said they had not been involved in the incident.

In her blog post, Catalano said police arrived at her house at about 9 a.m., after she had left for work, but while her husband was home.

"Do you own a pressure cooker?" an officer asked her husband, according to Catalano's account. Her husband responded the couple had a rice cooker to make quinoa. The next question: "What the hell is quinoa?"

A law enforcement source said the visit was made by local Long Island police.

Catalano said the incident left her shaken.

"All I know is - if I'm going to buy a pressure cooker in the near future, I'm not doing it online," Catalano said.

The Cleveland school bus driver who abducted, imprisoned and repeatedly raped three women was sentenced on Thursday to life in prison without parole, plus 1,000 years, after one of his victims confronted him and said he had put her through 11 years of hell.

Ariel Castro, 53, apologized to his victims, but was mostly defiant, verbally sparring with the judge during a court hearing as he sought to blame his actions on a sexual obsession and having been abused as a child.

"I am not a monster," he told the court in a rambling statement before sentencing.

The women, along with a 6-year-old girl Castro fathered, were rescued from his fortress-like house on May 6, after 9 to 11 years of captivity.

"If you asked my daughter, she would say, 'My dad is the best dad in the world'," Castro said.

"All the sex was consensual," he told the judge. "The girls were not virgins. They had multiple sex partners before me."

Cuyahoga County Judge Michael Russo described Castro as suffering from "extreme narcissism," and said his crimes were so severe that he should never emerge from prison. The former school bus driver had pleaded guilty to hundreds of charges, including murder under a fetal homicide law for beating and starving victim Michelle Knight to force her to miscarry.

When Russo brought up the murder charge in court, Castro said he was not a violent person and had pleaded guilty to murder only to spare the victims a long legal process.

"I am not a murderer," said Castro, as he stood with legs were shackled.

The full sentence was life without parole plus 1,000 years, ensuring that Castro would never leave prison.

Knight, 32, made a dramatic appearance in court before the sentencing and read a statement that Castro had persecuted her, starting with her abduction in 2002, until May 6, 2013, the day she was freed.

"Days turned into nights, nights turned into days. Years turned into eternity. I knew nobody cared about me. He told me that my family didn't care," Knight said, choking back tears.

"I spent 11 years of hell. Now your hell is just beginning," Knight said of Castro.

Judge Russo praised Knight for showing admirable "restraint" in her remarks, and she responded: "You're welcome."

Amanda Berry, 27, Gina DeJesus, 23, and Knight went missing from the west side of Cleveland between 2002 and 2004. Their presence was discovered after Berry's cries for help were heard coming from Castro's home.

Neighbors helped Berry break down a door and she then ran back inside to get her daughter, who had been born in the house on Christmas Day, with Knight's assistance.

The child had a "normal" life, Castro said, adding that she never saw the women in chains.

Castro showed emotion only when he spoke of the girl, who he described as his "miracle child."

"I heard I can file for parental rights," Castro told the judge. But Russo told him he would not be allowed any contact with the girl.

Earlier in the hearing, prosecutors presented graphic evidence of the crimes, including a dollhouse-size replica of the house where the women were imprisoned. Photos of the interior showed chains and boarded-up windows, doors with locks only on the outside and heavy curtains separating parts of the house.

A female police officer who arrived on the scene immediately after Berry was freed, said it was so dark she had to shine a light to climb the stairs. When Knight realized that the police were there to rescue her, she threw herself into the arms of one of the officers. DeJesus was so terrified she had to be coaxed out of a nearby room.

Prosecutors showed photos of Berry and DeJesus, looking gaunt and pale, soon after they were rescued.

Neither of those two women appeared in court, but their families presented statements on their behalf.

Berry's sister, Beth Serrano, said she could not put into words the impact the crimes had on her family, including the death of their mother before Berry was released. Berry's biggest concern, Serrano said, was protecting her 6-year-old daughter and deciding what to tell the girl and when.

"She (Berry) does not want to talk about these things. She has not talked about these things - even with me," Serrano said.

Sylvia Colon, spokeswoman for the DeJesus family, reached out to Castro's family, saying "Please know that we do not hold you accountable."

Gina DeJesus, who was the youngest of the three when abducted at just 14, is "thriving," the statement said.

"She will finish school, go to college, fall in love, and if she chooses, will get married and have children," the family statement said.

The DeJesus family, which like Castro is of Puerto Rican descent, ended its statement with a message for Castro in Spanish: "Que Dios se apiade de su alma," - May God have Mercy on your soul.

based push to see him reinstated.

The petition drive in support of English instructor Ken Bencomo on the website of social advocacy group Change.org has gathered over 9,000 signatures from his former students and people as far away as Spain since it was launched earlier this week.

The high school teacher and his partner were among a wave of same-sex couples who married after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June cleared the way for gay weddings to resume in California for the first time since 2008.

If Bencomo sues, his attorney Patrick McGarrigle sees it as a potential test case of legal protections some religious institutions claim to have in hiring and firing based on principles of faith.

Bencomo taught at the all-girls St. Lucy's Priory High School in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendora for over 16 years, but was terminated in July, a little more than a week after marrying his longtime partner, McGarrigle said.

Brittany Littleton, 23, a former student at St. Lucy's, is leading the online petition, which asks administrators to "reverse this act of prejudice" against her former teacher and "give him his job back."

A Beverly Hills resident and yoga instructor, Littleton said her drive is not meant to tear down St. Lucy's, which she described as pushing students to be "forward thinking."

"It's as much a fight for the school as it is for Mr. Bencomo, but we want them to know we do not stand by this decision and are horrified by it," Littleton said.

Raised Catholic, Bencomo, 45, chaired the school's English department, helped with the yearbook and served as a dance coach, McGarrigle said. School administrators were aware he was in a same-sex relationship, the attorney said.

But just over a week after his July 1 wedding was written up in the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, an administrator told Bencomo he was being let go because his marriage was "in public and violated the church's teaching," McGarrigle said.

Sister Helen Dziuk, an assistant principal at St. Lucy's, told Reuters the institution wished to "protect the privacy of everyone involved."

"The school cannot comment on any of these matters. These are private values and matters and may involve litigation, so we can't comment," she said.

POPE'S VIEW

The Archdiocese of Los Angeles declined to comment on the grounds that the school is privately run and not under its jurisdiction.

Pope Francis, who was elected in March, this week told reporters on a flight from Brazil that gays should be integrated into society, but homosexual acts are a sin.

McGarrigle said his client wishes to settle out of court, but could file a lawsuit. He said such a case, based in part on the fact that Bencomo's homosexuality had been tolerated at school, may become a legal test of what protections religious institutions have in firing an employee for a same-sex marriage.

Thirteen U.S. states now allow same-sex unions, with Minnesota and Rhode Island joining that group on Thursday.

"Clearly he (Bencomo) was terminated because he engaged in a lawful act that the school now believes - or at least asserts - was one step too far," McGarrigle said.

Karl Manheim, a Loyola Law School professor, said a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling found that religious institutions cannot exempt lay employees from workplace protections.

"To the extent that the church is involved in ordinary business operations, and running a school typically is, they're going to be subject to state and federal statutes," he said.

Striking bus drivers in the Phoenix area walked off the job and onto picket lines early on Thursday in a dispute over job security and conditions, leaving some 57,000 weekday commuters scrambling to find rides to work during the morning rush hour.

The strike against the First Transit company has shut down about 40 bus routes including ones that serve the cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa and Tempe and others that reach Phoenix and Scottsdale.

Most bus routes were operating in Phoenix, which is served by a different company than First Transit, and the light rail system for the Phoenix Valley was not idled.

"I'm pretty frustrated right now and if this continues I'm going to get angry," said Tara Rastogi, as she waited forlornly for a bus to take her from Chandler to her job at a research group in downtown Phoenix.

"For some people riding the bus is convenient. For me, it's almost the only option to get to work."

Her bus never arrived. Other commuters took to car-pooling or driving their own cars to deal with the bus strike.

The Amalgamated Transit Union and First Transit, a company that operates on behalf of the Valley Metro public agency, have been embroiled in bitter talks since the beginning of the year to forge a labor contract for about 400 bus drivers.

"We are doing this (strike) because they refuse to bargain with us in good faith," Bob Bean, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1433, told Reuters. "The public needs to know that we would go back to work if they were fair to us."

Bean said there was a possibility that negotiations would resume on Thursday, but no details had yet been worked out as of early afternoon.

Union leaders said the main sticking points remain the company's attempt to gain greater control over workplace conditions and its ability to fire employees. Other areas of dispute include the firm's attempt to increase workers' healthcare contributions.

On Wednesday, union officials reported that 95 percent of its drivers had voted to reject First Transit's best-and-final offer. Another last-minute proposal by management failed to avert the strike, which went into effect at midnight.

A spokeswoman for First Transit could not immediately be reached for comment.

Scott Somers, Valley Metro chairman and a Mesa city councilman, said the union's decision to strike represents a major blow to "our most vulnerable neighbors."

Valley Metro urged commuters to consider alternatives such as car-pooling or working from home and urged patience from its riders.

Spokeswoman Susan Tierney said there have been discussions about implementing a skeleton service for affected riders, but that no decision has yet been made.

"We continue to look at a contingency plan," she said. "We do hope that this agreement can be finalized soon so we can get back to our regularly scheduled service."



headline: Russia gives Snowden asylum, Obama-Putin summit in doubt
byline: By Timothy Heritage and Steve Holland
8:31am EDT

Russia rejected U.S. pleas and granted American fugitive Edward Snowden a year's asylum on Thursday, letting the former spy agency contractor slip out of a Moscow airport after more than five weeks in limbo while angering the United States and putting in doubt a planned summit between the two nations' presidents.

The United States wanted Russia to send Snowden home to face criminal charges including espionage for disclosing in June secret American internet and telephone surveillance programs. The White House signaled that President Barack Obama may boycott a September summit with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

Snowden, whose disclosures triggered an international furor over the reach of U.S. spy operations as part of its counterterrorism efforts, thanked Russia for his temporary asylum and declared that "the law is winning."

Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden's Russian lawyer, said the 30-year-old has found shelter in a private home of American expatriates.

Putin's move aggravated relations with the United States that were already strained by Russian support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's bloody civil war and a host of other issues.

"We see this as an unfortunate development and we are extremely disappointed by it," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters in Washington. "We are evaluating the utility of a summit, in light of this and other issues, but I have no announcement today on that."

Other high-level U.S.-Russian talks were also put in doubt.

Discussions planned for next week between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and their Russian counterparts are now "up in the air," according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, has avoided the hordes of reporters trying to find him since he landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport from Hong Kong on June 23. He gave them the slip again as he left the transit area where he had been holed up.

State television showed Snowden, wearing a backpack and a blue button-up shirt, getting into a gray car at the airport, driven by a young man in a baseball cap.

"Over the past eight weeks we have seen the Obama administration show no respect for international or domestic law but in the end the law is winning," Snowden, whose first leaks were published two months ago, was quoted as saying by the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group, which has assisted him.

"I thank the Russian Federation for granting me asylum in accordance with its laws and international obligations."

Grainy images on state television showed Snowden's document, which is similar to a Russian passport, and revealed that he had been granted asylum for a year from July 31.

'MOST WANTED MAN'

"He is the most wanted man on planet Earth," Kucherena told Reuters.

Kucherena said Snowden wants to rent an apartment and find work in Russia, and has no immediate plans to leave.

Snowden, who had his U.S. passport revoked by Washington, had bided his time in the transit area between the runway and passport control, which Russia considers neutral territory.

"He needs to work. He is not a rich man, and the money that he had, he has of course, spent on food," said Kucherena, who sits on two high-profile Russian government advisory bodies.

"Snowden is an expert, a very high-level expert, and I am receiving letters from companies and citizens who would eagerly give him a job. He will not have any problems," the lawyer said.

Snowden already has been offered a job by Russia's top social networking site.

A pledge not to publish more information that could harm the United States was the condition under which Putin said Snowden could receive safe harbor. "Edward assured me that he is not planning to publish any documents that blacken the American government," Kucherena said.

Snowden was accompanied by Sarah Harrison, a WikiLeaks legal researcher. "We would like to thank the Russian people and all those others who have helped to protect Mr. Snowden. We have won the battle - now the war," WikiLeaks said on Twitter.

"I am so thankful to the Russian nation and President Vladimir Putin," the American's father, Lonnie Snowden, told Russian state television. He is expected to travel to Russia to see his son shortly.

U.S. LAWMAKERS INCENSED

Prominent U.S. lawmakers - Republicans and Democrats - condemned Russia's action and urged Obama to take stern retaliatory steps beyond the issue of the September summit.

It is not clear whether Obama might also consider a boycott of the G20 summit in Russia in September, immediately after the planned summit with Putin, or of the Winter Olympics, which Russia will host in the city of Sochi next February.

"Russia has stabbed us in the back, and each day that Mr. Snowden is allowed to roam free is another twist of the knife," said Senator Chuck Schumer, a close Obama ally and fellow Democrat who urged Obama to recommend moving out of Russia the summit of G20 leaders planned for St. Petersburg.

Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, already sharp critics of Putin, called Russia's action a disgrace and a deliberate effort to embarrass the United States. They said the United States should retaliate by pushing for completion of all missile-defense programs in Europe and moving for another expansion of NATO to include Russian neighbor Georgia.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov played down concerns about the impact on relations with the United States.

"Our president has ... expressed hope many times that this will not affect the character of our relations," he said.

Snowden hopes to avoid the same fate as Bradley Manning, the U.S. Army soldier convicted on Tuesday on criminal charges including espionage and theft related to releasing classified data through WikiLeaks.

Nicaragua, Bolivia and Venezuela have offered Snowden refuge, but there are no direct commercial flights to Latin America from Moscow and he is concerned the United States would intercept any flight he takes.

Snowden also has received a marriage proposal via Twitter from Anna Chapman, the glamorous former agent who was deported to Russia from the United States in a Cold-War style spy swap in 2010.

Putin has said he wants to improve relations with the United States amid differences over the Syrian civil war, his treatment of political opponents and foreign-funded non-governmental organizations. He would have risked looking weak if he had handed Snowden over to the U.S. authorities.

More than half of Russians have a positive opinion of Snowden and 43 percent wanted him to be granted asylum, a poll released by independent research group Levada said this week.

floor New York City apartment after the railing buckled, police said.

Jennifer Rosoff had gone out on the balcony to smoke a cigarette at around 12:50 a.m. EDT when the railing gave way. She fell onto construction scaffolding at the first-floor level of the midtown Manhattan building, and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

Her death was believed to be an accident and no foul play was suspected, police said. Rosoff's date was in the apartment at the time, police said. The medical examiner will determine the cause of death.

The gray brick 20-story East Side highrise where the woman lived, is owned by the luxury real estate company Stonehenge. Only the apartments on the higher floors have balconies, according to the managing company's website.

Rosoff was the Director of Sales at TripleLift, an advertising agency on Fifth Avenue. She had previously worked at The New Yorker and at Cosmopolitan magazine, according to her LinkedIn profile.

"We are all deeply saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of our dear friend and co-worker," TripleLift CEO Eric Berry said in a statement. "She was a well-loved and highly-respected member of our team. Her tremendous energy and humor brought so much joy to the office."

headline: Lawyers in Detroit bankruptcy may face scrutiny on fees
byline: By Tom Hals
8:31am EDT

needed work, and, due to a quirk of municipal bankruptcy law, no apparent need to disclose the fees they charge.

But before lawyers from big-name firms could start totting up their billable hours, Judge Steven Rhodes made clear he wasn't happy with the lack of transparency. He said he wants to appoint an examiner to make sure fees charged to the city are fully disclosed and reasonable.

While fee examiners have been appointed in many of the biggest corporate bankruptcies, Rhodes appears to be the first judge to propose one in a Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy, according to a search of the Westlaw legal database.

Legal experts said making the appointment may stretch Rhodes' authority and that the city's lawyers would have grounds to contest an examiner. A spokesman for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Detroit said Rhodes would not comment.

In reality, it is unlikely lawyers will object to added oversight given that they are being paid from taxpayer funds. In the overheated political atmosphere surrounding the case, having an independent examiner approve fees could give a degree of cover to lawyers who often bill as much as $1,000 an hour.

In a matter of days, a top-flight attorney could bill more than an entire family makes in a year in Detroit, where the median annual household income is around $28,000.

The city's attorneys will be squaring off against, among others, Detroit's retirees, who have already vowed to block the bankruptcy. The majority of retired non-uniformed city workers collect less than $18,000 in pensions annually.

Acrimony in the case is already running high, with steady social media attacks on Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr's bills for room service deliveries of crab cake dinners, even though his spokesman has said he is not billing the city for such items.

With more than $18 billion of debt, Detroit filed for bankruptcy on July 18, in the midst of a long dry spell for large corporate bankruptcies that has resulted from a recovering economy and rock-bottom corporate borrowing costs. The few big cases still in the courts, including American Airlines and Eastman Kodak Co, are nearing an end.

"Everybody nationally in the bankruptcy world, particularly on the debtors' side, is scrambling for work," said Douglas Bernstein, a lawyer with Plunkett Cooney in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. "That's why so much attention is being paid to this case."

The outcome of Detroit's bankruptcy could set important precedents that will impact how other cities deal with billions of dollars in pension and bond obligations. With so much at stake, Detroit and its bond insurers and unions are likely to splash out on the best legal help.

The city has retained the law firm of Jones Day, which brought Chrysler through bankruptcy in 2009. With more than 100 lawyers on the case, Jones Day picked up about $25 million in fees from Chrysler, according to court records.

Jones Day declined to comment for this story.

Legal work was only a small part of the total cost for Chrysler. The auto maker also paid for accountants, financial advisers and tax specialists for a final tab of almost $100 million. A similar set of professionals is expected to rack up fees in the Detroit bankruptcy.

In a Chapter 11 case like Chrysler, creditors and the court can review and object to each firm's detailed fee applications, which can run hundreds of pages and must account for time in six-minute intervals.

One of Chrysler's lawyers was Kevyn Orr, who is now Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager and the person leading the city's transit through the bankruptcy process.

By way of example, on April 20, 2010, Orr worked on the Chrysler case as a Jones Day partner and spent 3.5 hours preparing for a court hearing and 4.6 hours in court that day. Orr's time cost Chrysler $6,075, according to court documents.

Orr also billed Chrysler $459.40 for a flight between his Washington office and New York for the hearing, $71 to change his flight time and $4 to change his seat on the flight. He spent $376.43 for a hotel room in connection with the trip.

The section of the bankruptcy code that required Orr to make such detailed disclosures is absent in Chapter 9, which is used for municipal bankruptcies such as Detroit's.

The 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution reserves certain powers to the states to manage their internal affairs, and as a result a U.S. Bankruptcy Court cannot interfere with a state's control over its municipalities. Legal experts said that prevents a judge from telling a city whom to hire and how much to pay.

That's why in the case of Jefferson County, Alabama, the biggest Chapter 9 bankruptcy prior to Detroit, there are no court records with detailed fee and expense disclosures. The county has voluntarily said it has paid $38 million in legal fees since it filed for bankruptcy in 2011.

Nevertheless on July 23, Rhodes, the judge in the Detroit case, proposed the appointment of a fee examiner to "assure the court, the city, the creditors and the public that the city's professional fee expenses are fully disclosed and reasonable."

Fees and expenses would be disclosed monthly, under the judge's proposal.

Rhodes will discuss the proposal at a court hearing Friday and is likely to take suggestions on how an examiner would be selected and paid for. Legal experts doubt anyone will challenge his authority to make the appointment.

"Do you really want to poke momma bear? Is that something you want to argue with Rhodes about?" said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who has served as a fee examiner in Chapter 11 cases such as that of Pilgrim's Pride, the poultry company.

Already, a public records request by the American Lawyer magazine has revealed Jones Day brought in $1.4 million in the six weeks after it started work for Detroit in March.

If an independent examiner says legal fees of $1,000 an hour are reasonable, that might ease the pressure.

"If (a fee request) passes muster it certainly has the potential to give them some cover and it shows the judge is taking the fees seriously," said Bernstein, the attorney in Bloomfield Hills.

Fee examiners often review applications and work out questions with the applicant away from the court, but not always.

In the General Motors' bankruptcy, fee examiner objections eventually forced the judge to decide the appropriate number of attorneys for certain tasks. Judge Robert Gerber at times even ruled when lawyers should have taken public transportation instead of taxis.

"Most fee examiners try to justify their existence by cutting fees," said Kenneth Klee, who represents Jefferson County.



headline: New York City plans beach in Manhattan near Brooklyn Bridge
byline: By Francesca Trianni
8:31am EDT

Manhattan, an island with miles of waterfront, will finally get its own beach.

Just minutes from Wall Street, the Empire State Building and other landmarks that define New York City, a playground of sand and surf will be created out of a strip of fenced-off wasteland in the southern tip of the island.

The $7 million Brooklyn Bridge Beach plan, whose details were unveiled on Thursday, covers 11,000 square feet area under the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, at the mouth of the East River.

One caveat is the sewage-tainted water, which most New Yorkers consider too polluted to swim in.

"We're embracing the great power of our rivers," City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said as she announced the plan's funding, with the Brooklyn Bridge in the background.

"Our rivers were part of what made us the greatest city in the world and now we are reclaiming them for economic development and for recreation, but also for protection."

With fresh lessons from superstorm Sandy, which caused $50 billion in damages and economic losses in New York state, the project will create salt marsh planters and wetlands that would serve as buffer against future storms and flooding.

The area will also feature terraced seating, a kayak launch, a spot for fishing, tree-lined walkways and concession stands.

"If we can bring this plan to fruition right here in Manhattan, this could be a model for the rest of the world," said Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer.

The plan, initiated three years ago, is funded by the Manhattan Borough President's office in collaboration with the City Council.

While the main provisions to build Brooklyn Bridge Beach have secured funding, the larger, more complex plan of revitalizing Manhattan's East Side waterfront, between the Brooklyn Bridge and East 38th street, would require raising additional capital.



headline: Bulger lawyers try to show mob boss' friendly side with photos
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

Photos that show James "Whitey" Bulger with poodles, parrots and at least one baby goat prompted the judge at his murder and racketeering trial to speculate that the notorious mobster may take the stand to try and show jurors his human side.

Judge Denise Casper said she thought defense lawyers asked to enter the photos as evidence "in anticipation of Mr. Bulger possibly taking the stand." Bulger, longtime head of Boston's Winter Hill crime gang, has been charged with participating in 19 murders, and speculation has been mounting that he may take the stand in his own defense.

Prosecutors spent the first seven weeks of the trial calling on former hit men, smugglers, and extortion victims who depicted the 83-year-old Bulger as a cold-blooded killer who ruled Boston's underworld in the 1970s and '80s.

Defense attorneys have been working to undermine that image. This week they filed a batch of photographs at the U.S. District Court in Boston showing Bulger relaxing with pets and friends.

One photo shows Bulger leaning back in an armchair wearing a bathrobe and surrounded by poodles. In others, he is hugging a black baby goat or posing with parrots. There is a photo of Bulger with a priest and in another he is with hockey player Chris Nilan next to the NHL's Stanley Cup.

Casper did not immediately rule on whether she would allow the photographs to be shown to the jury, saying Bulger's lawyers must decide by Friday whether Bulger will testify or not.

U.S. prosecutor Fred Wyshak said on Thursday that including the new photos of Bulger in the trial was "totally improper" adding that "I don't know if being an animal lover is going to salvage his reputation."

Bulger, whose gang carried out extortion, gambling and drug smuggling rackets, has pleaded not guilty to the charges, although his attorneys have admitted that he had been involved in organized crime.

Bulger's story has captured Boston's imagination for decades, and also recalled a dark period for Boston's FBI when corrupt agents wined and dined gangsters and gave them tips that helped them evade arrest and identify snitches.

Bulger's defense has pointed out that many of the government's witnesses were neck deep in crime themselves, and suggested that evidence from Boston's FBI office could be tainted by widespread corruption and mismanagement.

The defense also has focused on countering charges that Bulger strangled two women in the early 1980s and was an informant for the FBI. Bulger has vehemently denied that he was an informant, or a "rat" in mob parlance.

On Thursday, former FBI agent Matthew Cronin added heft to claims the agency was ill-managed when he testified that then-supervisor John Morris, in the presence of another agent John Connolly, had once asked him to remove certain names from a wire tap affidavit to protect them.

"As a matter of cooperation, I had no problem taking them out," Cronin said. Connolly, an agent who dealt with Bulger for years, was later jailed for corruption. Morris was granted immunity from prosecution for his testimony during 1998 federal hearings about FBI misconduct.

Bulger fled Boston after a 1994 tip from Connolly of impending arrest and spent 16 years as a fugitive before law enforcement finally caught him hiding out in a seaside apartment in California in 2011, with a stash of money and guns.

Michael Kendall, a partner at the Boston law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emory and a former federal prosecutor who investigated some of Bulger's associates, said the defense strategy to "humanize" Bulger with the new photos would likely have little effect on the trial's outcome.

"I can show you pictures of Hitler with Eva Braun and their dog, and that won't affect our view of history," he said.

Striking bus drivers in the Phoenix area walked off the job and onto picket lines early on Thursday, leaving some 57,000 weekday commuters scrambling to find rides to work during the morning rush hour.

The strike against the First Transit company has shut down about 40 bus routes including ones that serve the cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa and Tempe and others that reach Phoenix and Scottsdale.

Most bus routes were operating in Phoenix, which is served by a different company than First Transit, and the light rail system for the Phoenix Valley was not idled.

The Amalgamated Transit Union and First Transit, a company that operates on behalf of the Valley Metro public agency, have been embroiled in bitter talks since the beginning of the year to forge a labor contract for about 400 bus drivers.

"We are doing this (strike) because they refuse to bargain with us in good faith," Bob Bean, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1433, told Reuters. "The public needs to know that we would go back to work if they were fair to us."

No contract talks to break the stalemate had been scheduled as of Thursday morning.

Union leaders said the main sticking points are the company's attempt to increase workers' healthcare contributions and to gain greater control over what they described as employee's workplace rights.

On Wednesday, union officials reported that 95 percent of its drivers had voted to reject First Transit's best-and-final offer. Another last-minute proposal by management failed to avert the strike, which went into effect at midnight.

A spokeswoman for First Transit could not immediately be reached for comment.

The company had said it was disappointed that labor talks had failed and the union had decided to strike, but that the firm was open to further negotiations.

Scott Somers, Valley Metro chairman and a Mesa city councilman, said the union's decision to strike represents a major blow to "our most vulnerable neighbors."

"I expect continued service with ongoing good faith dialogue," Somers said in a statement. "A strike is unacceptable and would be devastating to riders who rely on the service."

Valley Metro urged commuters to consider alternatives such as car-pooling or working from home on Thursday morning.

"I would ask people to be patient, and we hope to have the service running again as soon as we possibly can," said Susan Tierney, a Valley Metro spokeswoman.

certain closure for the museum if Detroit sells major pieces from the 60,000 works in the institute's art collection as a way to address the city's dire financial situation.

In an interview Wednesday, Annmarie Erickson, the DIA's chief operating officer, told Reuters the museum could lose significant funding if pieces from the collection are sold.

"It would certainly mean the closure of the museum, maybe not tomorrow, but eventually," Erickson said. "Our situation is in some respects just as dire as that of the creditors."

But with Detroit facing more than $18 billion in debt and retired city workers confronting cuts to pension and health benefits, the museum could have a tough time making a case for preserving its assets, bankruptcy experts say. Kevyn Orr, the state-appointed financial manager, has not ruled out the sale of DIA treasures to address the city's financial plight.

The rocky outlook for cultural assets like the DIA illustrates the tough choices facing a city once considered the cradle of American vehicle manufacturing. Like General Motors and Chrysler - Detroit titans that survived collapse by having painful decisions thrust upon them via bankruptcy - the city may have to part with cultural gems to bounce back from disaster.

Mark Young, president of the Detroit Lieutenants and Sergeants Association, which represents about 500 mid-level managers in Detroit's police department, said art should not outweigh workers, whose pensions and benefits are likely to face big cuts as Detroit restructures.

"The Van Gogh must go," said Young. "We don't need Monet - we need money."

The Detroit Institute of Art is not the only major cultural institution that could be caught up in Detroit's bankruptcy proceedings. Belle Isle, a 982-acre recreational spot in the Detroit River, as well as the Detroit Zoo could both be sold.

While the cultural assets may have a strong book value - the DIA collection is said to be worth billions - converting them to cash may prove both politically and practically challenging.

The state of Michigan first offered to lease Belle Isle from Detroit in January, agreeing to assume $6 million in annual operating costs. But Governor Rick Snyder abandoned the plan after the City Council stalled a vote on it. Orr has said he intends to enter a new agreement with the state under "generally the same terms" as the January offer.

In one of the more improbable proposals, a local developer, Rod Lockwood, has floated a plan to buy Belle Isle for $1 billion and turn it into a libertarian commonwealth where residents would pay a $300,000 citizenship fee. But public officials have expressed determination to keep Belle Isle open to the public, and Orr's spokesman, Bill Nowling, on Wednesday dismissed the Lockwood proposal as "out of the mainstream."

The Detroit Zoo, supported by a tax voters approved in 2008, is owned by the city but operated by the nonprofit Detroit Zoological Society, which received $475,018 from the city in 2012, down more than $100,000 from 2011, to reimburse security and insurance costs.

"The primary asset is really the land," the zoo's spokeswoman, Patricia Janeway, told Reuters. "The facility has obviously been developed as a zoo and would require major expense for other use."

The zoo's animals, she added, "fundamentally have no commercial value."

ORR'S OPTIONS

None of the cultural assets has caught the attention of the public quite like the Detroit Institute of Art. One of the largest U.S. fine art museums, it features works such as a Vincent van Gogh 1887 self portrait and a 27-panel fresco by Mexican artist Diego Rivera. It is a rare shared point of civic pride for citizens of both Detroit and its suburbs.

The DIA is owned by the city and run by a nonprofit group whose board includes some of Detroit's most high-profile civic leaders. Residents of Detroit and its suburbs agreed to help cover operating costs through a tax levied according to the value of their real estate.

Erickson, the museum official, warned that art sales could lead to revocation of the tax, which provides nearly two-thirds of the museum's roughly $35 million budget.

Doug Bernstein, a bankruptcy expert and lawyer at Plunkett Cooney, said Detroit could argue in bankruptcy court that it needs to keep the DIA intact. "If you're going to ever restructure a city, you've got to revitalize the tax base, and part of that is having attractions," he said.

Even if Orr does try to sell DIA art, he could run into obstacles. The museum has said the art cannot be sold because it is held in a charitable trust for the people of Michigan, a position backed by state Attorney General Bill Schuette.

Individual pieces of donated art can also carry contracts that bar their sale, Erickson said. Robert Hudson Tannahill, the late Detroit art collector, donated 470 objects, but his will stipulates that if the DIA sells any piece, the entire collection must be offered to another museum, Erickson said.

Orr may be able to overcome those blockades under bankruptcy rules that let debtors reject unprofitable contracts, said Bill Brandt, a bankruptcy expert and head of turnaround consultant Development Specialists Inc.

In the end, some art is likely to go, said Brandt. "You can't kill pensions but save the art," he said.

If Orr does move to sell the art, he will probably face public resistance, along with a costly, time-consuming legal battle. The DIA has retained bankruptcy guru Richard Levin and has saved for months to fund its legal costs, Erickson said.

There are alternatives to flat-out sales, like creating a public-private partnership to run the museum.

"But the private entity has to make money," said one bankruptcy expert, who declined to be named because he is involved in the case. "Where's it going to come from? Charging for admission? Then your attendance goes down."

Orr could seek to charge the DIA rent, but Erickson said the museum already pays $31 million a year in operating costs and cannot afford much more.

'ALL DOLLARS ARE GREEN'

Politically, there may be no winning formula, with strong feelings on both sides of the argument.

Richard Feigen, chairman of the Richard L. Feigen &amp; Co gallery, said some collectors would be repulsed by a sale of DIA art. "The auction would be tainted," he said. "Even if I had the financial capability, I wouldn't buy."

The city's creditors are likely to view the DIA's art a bit differently. "I would say all dollars are green," said one creditor-side professional who declined to be named.

It won't be a quick process. Erickson said Orr has yet to meet with the DIA to discuss his plans for the art. A person close to one creditor said Orr has not brought the issue up in discussions with creditors, either.

"In spite of all the attention given to this, I think we're pretty far down (Orr's) list," Erickson said. "We're in it for the long haul."

FBI Director Robert Mueller was given the U.S. Justice Department's highest award on Thursday at a ceremony a month before he completes what colleagues called a transformative tenure atop the nation's largest investigative agency.

Mueller, 68, became FBI director one week before the September 11, 2001, attacks, and is due to retire when his term expires on September 4. He was dubbed "Bobby Three Sticks" because his full name is Robert Mueller III.

Attorney General Eric Holder departed from protocol to give Mueller the Justice Department's Award for Exceptional Service, which is supposed to be given only once a year.

"He has led nothing less than a large-scale and historic transformation of the bureau," Holder said, adding that Mueller redefined the FBI "as an intelligence-driven agency."

No speakers at the ceremony, which drew senior officials from the White House and CIA, mentioned the recent fury over the extent of the FBI's new surveillance capacity as exposed in leaks to U.S. and British newspapers by former contractor Edward Snowden, now holed up in a Moscow airport as he seeks asylum.

The Senate on Monday voted 93-1 to confirm James Comey, who served as the Justice Department's No. 2 official under President George W. Bush, to succeed Mueller as FBI director.

Mueller was the chief federal prosecutor in San Francisco when Bush appointed him to the FBI. A New England prep school and Princeton graduate who served in the U.S. Marine Corps, he was known for his formal bearing and serious demeanor.

annual transparency report.

The United States made three-quarters of the 1,157 data requests during the six-month period, according to the San Francisco-based company's report. (Report: <a href="https://transparency.twitter.com/">transparency.twitter.com/</a>)

Governments usually want the emails or IP addresses tied to a Twitter account.

In one well-known case, a French court ordered Twitter in February to turn over information about an anonymous account that posted anti-Semitic tweets. Twitter, which had initially resisted by arguing that the data was stored beyond French jurisdiction in its California servers, ultimately complied in June.

Efforts to censor Twitter content have also risen sharply, the company said.

"Over the last six months, we have gone from withholding content in two countries to withholding content (ranging from hate speech to defamation) in seven countries," said Twitter legal policy manager Jeremy Kessel.

Twitter was censored the most in Brazil, where courts issued orders on nine occasions to remove a total of 39 defamatory tweets.

The report did not include secret information requests within the United Sates authorized under the Patriot Act, a law enacted after the September 11 attacks. U.S. companies are prohibited from acknowledging the existence of data requests made under those statutes.

Transparency reports such as the one published semi-annually by Twitter have been a particularly contentious issue in Silicon Valley in the wake of a series of leaks in June by former security contractor Edward Snowden, who alleged that major service providers including Google Inc, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp systematically pass along huge troves of user data to the National Security Agency.

The companies, which have denied the scope of Snowden's allegations, have asked the U.S. government for permission to reveal the precise number of national security requests they receive in order to publicly argue that their cooperation with the government has been relatively limited. The negotiations between the companies, which include Twitter, remain ongoing, but firms including Microsoft and Facebook released in June some approximate figures of how many users have been affected by the data dragnet cast by U.S. intelligence.

In the first half of the year, authorities in Japan, another large Twitter user base, made 87 requests while U.K. agencies filed 26. The majority of the requests come in the form of court-issued subpoenas, Twitter said.

headline: GM, Ford, Chrysler July sales fall short of expectations

8:31am EDT

General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Group LLC all reported disappointing U.S. auto sales in July, hurt by low inventory of some popular car models, including Ford's Fusion midsize sedan.

Looking at the results, RBC Capital Markets analyst Joe Spak said the annual sales rate for July would be around 15.4 million vehicles, below analysts' average forecast of 15.8 million.

All three major U.S. automakers reported strong truck sales amid a boom in the housing and oil industries. But car sales fell short of estimates.

During a conference call, Ford's U.S. sales analyst, Erich Merkle, said low supply of the Fusion and other models "muted" the company's sales increase during the month. Ford also said supply of the Focus compact car grew tighter in July.

GM sold 234,071 cars and trucks in July, up 16 percent from a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected the largest U.S. automaker to post sales of 243,134. GM forecast the industry's annual sales rate in July would be around 15.7 million.

Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, said its U.S. sales last month totaled 193,715 vehicles, up 11 percent from a year ago. Analysts had expected 200,000. Chrysler, a unit of Italy's Fiat SpA, sold 140,102 vehicles in July. Analysts had expected, on average, 146,275.

Ford's miss stemmed from slower sales of two key models that the company revamped last year. Fusion sales fell 12 percent in July, while sales of the Escape crossover were up just 3.6 percent, compared with a sales increase of 20.3 percent for the Escape in the January-July period.

Focus sales were up 1.9 percent in July. Ford Explorer sales were up 12.6 percent, compared with a jump of 24.1 percent over the first seven months of the year.

"We're working really, really hard to expand the capacity as needed," said Ken Czubay, Ford's vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service. He also said the company is working to boost production of the Explorer and Focus.

Industry sales in July were led by surging demand for full-size pickup trucks. July was expected to be the second-best sales month of the year, after June's annual sales rate of 16 million.

Strong demand for pickups is particularly good news for U.S. automakers, which dominate that sector and reap large profits from those vehicles. Chrysler launched a new version of its Ram pickup last fall, while GM started selling its redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks in June.

Chrysler's Ram truck sales gained 31 percent in July. Sales of the Ford F-Series trucks were up 22.6 percent. GM said its full-size pickup truck sales were up 44 percent, the best since July 2007.

Nissan Motor Co said its U.S. sales in July rose 10.9 percent to 109,041 vehicles, below the 111,115 expected by five analyst polled by Reuters. Volkswagen said its July U.S. auto sales fell 3.3 percent.

hour travel plans because of a bus strike that will start on Thursday after contract talks between union drivers and management collapsed.

Some 40 bus lines serving the Arizona cities of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa and Tempe will be idled by the walkout, along with some routes through Phoenix itself and Scottsdale.

The Amalgamated Transit Union and management for First Transit, which operates buses for Valley Metro, have been in contract talks since the first of the year over wages, benefits and work rules, the transit authority said.

Valley Metro urged commuters to consider alternatives such as car-pooling or working from home on Thursday morning.

Late on Wednesday, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1433 officials said that 95 percent of its voting drivers had rejected First Transit's latest contract proposal, according to a report in the Arizona Republic newspaper.

Attempts to reach representatives of Local 1433 were not successful, but a spokeswoman for First Transit confirmed that the company's offer had been rejected and that the union had voted to strike.

"We're disappointed in the decision and regret that we have not been able to reach agreement," spokeswoman Jen Biddinger told Reuters.

"We have contacted the federal mediator to determine why the offer was rejected and to explore additional discussions with the union. We are open to continuing negotiation," she added.

In January, Valley Metro contracted with First Transit to serve as the operator of bus service originating from depots in Tempe and Mesa in the east Phoenix Valley.

On July 1, First Transit assumed responsibility for the operations of 40 local, express and circulator routes primarily serving the area. First Transit says it employs a staff of more than 700 operations and maintenance personnel to keep its fleet of 300 buses running.

Local elected officials have urged the two sides to stay at the bargaining table until a settlement is reached, citing disruptions a strike would cause to residents and the business community.

one with a sweeping vision for the city's future.

"The message across the board is, thank God someone else is in the race," Hidary said in an interview.

Hidary, who casts himself as a business-friendly candidate in the mold of New York City's current mayor Michael Bloomberg, said two weeks ago that he was entering the race. He has hired seasoned campaign aides, including Joe Trippi, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns.

People who know Hidary, a 45-year-old bachelor who lives just west of the Plaza Hotel on Central Park South, describe him as a quick-thinking ideas factory.

"He's one of those people who's always one step ahead of you," said Bill Abrams, president of Trickle Up, a non-profit organization that provides seed capital for women entrepreneurs. "He has a huge rolodex and really interesting ideas."

Unlike Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman who as mayor pioneered changes in public health and economic development, Hidary is largely unknown in the city and, even among his admirers, there are questions about whether he has the skills needed to manage a massive, complicated city.

"He is a very creative, smart guy who is a great spokesman for the New York tech sector," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group. Asked if those skills translate into politics, Wylde said, simply, "No."

"It's a fine art that demands a blend of political and management skills. And Jack is untested," she said. Still, with voters largely undecided, "anything could happen," she said.

While in his twenties, Hidary became successful through companies he started or bought that served the tech community. Over the past 15 years, his focus has shifted to non-profit work including micro finance.

FILLING A VACUUM?

This week, former Congressman Anthony Weiner fell to fourth place from first in a Quinnipiac poll, as city tabloids splashed details about a scandal involving racy online conversations with women and lewd photographs.

Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 over similar behavior and has been attempting a political comeback in the mayor race.

City Council Speaker Christine Quinn was the front-runner in the poll with less than 40 percent. On that basis, she would find herself in a runoff for the Democratic nomination with the third-place candidate, former city comptroller Bill Thompson, and he would win.

Enter Hidary.

Hidary's vision starts in the Ocean Parkway section of New York City's borough of Brooklyn, where he grew up.

A descendent of Syrian Jews, Hidary's family is well-known in the area, and he estimates 400 of his relatives live there. "There are weddings every other week," he said. Matchmaking efforts on his behalf have been "very, very, very" intense.

Standing on a blighted stretch of Coney Island's boardwalk, he asked why it was not lined with restaurants. Later, at the Jewish community center where he spent summers playing basketball, Hidary said he wanted 30 centers just like it around the city that would offer job training and other services.

In Bensonhurst, another Brooklyn neighborhood, he pointed to vacant storefronts and said they should be shared working spaces for entrepreneurs.

Hidary made his fortune through entrepreneurial endeavors after dropping out of Columbia University, where he was studying neuroscience and philosophy. He went to work on brain imaging at the National Institutes of Health, but left after three years to help start EarthWeb, a company dedicated to the needs of techies.

In 1998, EarthWeb went public and acquired companies that he saw as potential competitors. One of them, Dice.com, a jobs website for IT professionals, became enormously successful.

Since then, New York City has been his project.

Some of Hidary's more audacious ideas are likely to stir controversy. He wants city schools to specialize in project-based teaching so they reduce their emphasis on standardized testing. And, he wants all teachers to be retrained so they will be able to use more creative teaching methods.

On stop-and-frisk, an issue that has polarized New York City's voters, Hidary was largely supportive of the practice, but wants to see police officers equipped with better technology.

Bloomberg, who will end his third term at the end of this year, has defended the policy of stopping, questioning and frisking suspected wrongdoers as a crime fighting tool, but opponents have likened it to racial profiling.

The Hidary campaign said it would be ready to make its big push in October, after the Republicans and Democrats have decided on their nominees. Hidary will run as a third party candidate.

"Politics abhors a vacuum and there's a huge vacuum in this race," said Joe Trippi, a Hidary aide. "We've got plenty of time."



headline: Midnight weddings as two U.S. states legalize gay marriage

sex marriage became legal on Thursday.

"By the power now finally invested in me," said Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak to boisterous cheers from family members and supporters of gay marriage, "I hereby declare Margaret and Cathy legally married."

The couple's five-year-old son, wearing a black tuxedo, participated in the ceremony along with a gay men's chorus wearing black T-shirts declaring, "Marry Us."

Miles, 49, fell in love with ten Broeke, 44, while working at a nonprofit organization that helps the homeless.

The couple wanted to marry more than a decade ago, but the law prevented it. So they settled for a commitment ceremony and a mountain of paperwork to legally merge their lives.

Now that Minnesota has officially sanctioned gay marriage, the couple said they will no longer worry about their legal status.

Rhode Island - one hour ahead on eastern time - and Minnesota on Thursday became the 12th and 13th states to sanction gay nuptials. Minnesota became the second in the Midwest, after Iowa.

In Rhode Island, the smallest U.S. state by area and the last in New England to legalize gay marriage, Democratic state Representative Frank Ferri will wed his partner of three decades, Tony Carparco.

While the two men wed seven years ago when they vacationed in Canada, Ferri - who helped lead the drive for legalization in Rhode Island - said Thursday's ceremony in their home state would be more meaningful.

Minneapolis couple Miles and ten Broeke said the legalization of gay marriage would end a stigma for them.

Not long ago, a child told the couple's 5-year-old son that he could not have two mothers. "No one can say that anymore," said Miles, crying.

Michelle Farley and Leisha Suggs plan to exchange vows on the rooftop of a Japanese restaurant on the south side of Minneapolis before a small group of friends. Farley, 35, and Suggs, 28, fell in love while attending the University of Maryland seven years ago.

When the couple moved to Minnesota — a place they perceived as progressive — they were shocked to see a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage on the 2012 ballot. "It was very scary," Farley said.

Minnesota voters rejected the proposal and elected a Democratic majority to the state Legislature. Those lawmakers voted in May to make gay marriage legal.

In the hours before gay marriage became legal in the state, Paul Portenlanger, 40, and Gregg Bell, 43, held hands as they strolled along the banks of the Mississippi River. The couple, who were married three years ago in Washington, D.C., were on their way to a pre-marriage party.

Both men plan to skip work on Thursday, search local parks for gay marriages and drink champagne, they said.



headline: Congress finally votes to cut student loan interest rates
byline: By Elvina Nawaguna
8:31am EDT

U.S. college students will likely pay a reduced interest rate of 3.86 percent on their student loans for the new school year, after lawmakers on Wednesday finally passed a compromise bill that would reverse a recent rate hike.

The House of Representatives voted 392-31 in support of a bipartisan deal to lower interest rates on millions of new federal student loans. The Senate passed the bill on July 24 and President Barack Obama is expected to sign it into law.

The action followed months of partisan bickering, with Democrats and Republicans blaming each other for a politically embarrassing delay that had the potential to cost students and their parents thousands of dollars.

The legislation replaces a system in which Congress fixed interest rates every year and substitutes it with a market-based mechanism tied to the government's cost of borrowing and capped to protect borrowers in the event of a severe spike in rates.

The legislation passed just two days before Congress recesses for five weeks, after several failed efforts in the House and Senate.

Interest rates on student loans automatically doubled on July 1 to 6.8 percent after Congress failed to meet the deadline to prevent the rate increase. Congress has since incorporated a retroactive fix that would keep borrowers of loans originated since July 1 when rates had doubled from paying the higher rate.

The measure passed Wednesday pegs interest rates on student loans to the 10-year Treasury note plus 2.05 percentage points for undergraduates, and plus 3.6 percentage points for graduate student loans.

The interest rate would roughly work out to 3.86 percent this year for undergraduates and 5.42 percent for graduates.

Supporters of the bill say it gets politicians out of the business of setting student loan rates and provides certainty for students and their families.

'LONG-TERM FIX'

Critics of a market-based system say it fails to offer enough protection against increasing rates as the economy improves.

"This bill provides American college students immediate debt relief on upcoming student loans," said California Representative George Miller, the senior Democrat at the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. "Families battered by the recent recession should have received this relief over a month ago."

In 2007, Congress lowered the interest rates on federal subsidized Stafford loans to 3.4 percent. That lower rate was due to expire last year, but Congress extended it for another year rather than argue about a replacement for it during an election year.

Under the caps in the new plan, if market rates rise, undergraduates could pay as high as 8.25 percent and graduates as much as 9.5 percent. The rate could go to 10.5 percent for PLUS loans for parents who borrow to pay for their children's college.

"We wanted to get out of the partisan squabbling that has been happening in this city every year - let the market do it in a way that is fair to students and the taxpayer," said Education Committee Chairman Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican.

"After months of great uncertainty, students can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing that interest rates on subsidized federal loans for college won't double from last year and a long-term fix will be in place to avoid these annual political chess matches over the loan program," said Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.

George Zimmerman, a volunteer watchman whose acquittal in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin led to protests, was pulled over by police in Texas on Sunday for speeding, officials said on Wednesday.

Zimmerman told the officer that he had a weapon in his glove compartment and was going "nowhere in particular," said Brian Brooks, city manager of Forney, Texas, about 25 miles southeast of Dallas, where Zimmerman was stopped.

The gun in the glove box is legal in Texas, and police routinely ask motorists if they have weapons in the car, Brooks said. He said the entire stop lasted less than five minutes.

"It wasn't for super-excessive speeds, they just got him on regular speeding," Brooks said. "It's a pretty routine stop except for the fact that it was George Zimmerman."

Zimmerman was released when it was determined that he had no warrants.

Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter on July 13 in Florida after a racially charged trial in the shooting of Martin in February 2012. Thousands of people demonstrated across the United States after the verdict.

Zimmerman, who was a volunteer neighborhood watchman in the central Florida town of Sanford, Florida at the time of the shooting, said he acted in self-defense.

headline: Texas jury rules ban on registering cloned horses violates law

monopoly laws by banning cloned animals from its prestigious registry, a decision that could encourage cloning and open the way for the animals to participate in lucrative horse races.

Two Texas breeders, rancher Jason Abraham and veterinarian Gregg Veneklasen, sued the American Quarter Horse Association last year, asserting the group was operating a monopoly by excluding clones.

A federal court jury in Amarillo, Texas, decided on Tuesday that the ban on clones violated federal and state antitrust laws, but did not award the $6 million in damages sought.

The association said it was disappointed with the jury verdict and was considering an appeal. A court hearing will be held soon to determine whether the association will be forced to open its register as a result of the verdict, officials said.

No other horse breeding registry allows cloned animals, although the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association allows cloned horses to compete in rodeos.

The quarter horse association issues and maintains a pedigree registry of American quarter horses, a popular breed associated with cowboys riding on the range in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Quarter horses are known for their strength and speed over short distances, and the name is derived from quarter mile races. They are also popular in rodeos.

The association said in court that it sanctions thousands of quarter horse races annually with total prize money of about $131.5 million in 2012.

The quarter horse association, which has a registry of 751,747 animals, stated in court that it is a private organization and has the right to decide its membership rules. It had previously allowed horses born using reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination to register.

Some quarter horse owners and breeders have complained that cloned animals have an unfair advantage because they are selected according to superior genetic characteristics.

Cloning is the creation of an animal that is an exact genetic copy of another, with the same DNA. A sheep named Dolly produced in Scotland drew international attention when she was shown to the public in 1997. Since then, cloning of agricultural livestock such as cattle and pigs as well as horses and sheep has become more common although it is still a small portion of total livestock production.

The quarter horse association said it had sent a survey to 3,000 members of the group and found 86 percent opposed to registering cloned horses.

Carol Harris, 90, who owns Bo-Bett Farm in central Florida and has registered thoroughbred race horses with AQHA for over 60 years, said many people do not understand the issue.

"I'm not opposed to cloning, but when they try to force you to register clones in a private association, that is not proper," Harris said.

But Blake Russell, president of ViaGen, a Texas-based company that has produced some 160 cloned horses since 2006, said that genetic superiority does not guarantee better performance because environmental factors such as training could make a difference.

"I would say that a cloned horse has an advantage in the breeding barn if the donor was a proven superior producer, but the cloned horse would not necessarily have a substantial advantage in the performance arena," he said.

The verdict could give a boost to his business, Russell said. "We expect more (demand for cloning) now that their registration appears imminent."



headline: Texas executes man who killed truck drivers in road rage incident
byline: By Karen Brooks
8:31am EDT

Texas on Wednesday executed a man convicted of killing two truck drivers in a fit of road rage after one of the drivers pulled a truck in front of his motorcycle on the highway.

Douglas Feldman, 55, was pronounced dead by lethal injection at 6:28 p.m. (2328 GMT) at a state prison in Huntsville, Texas, according to prison officials.

Feldman was convicted of capital murder in 1999 for the shooting deaths of Robert Everett and Nick Velasquez, both 18-wheeler truck drivers who encountered Feldman on a highway north of Dallas in 1998, according to an account by the Texas Attorney General's Office.

Feldman's appeals included the argument that his trial lawyers were deficient, a juror was improperly dismissed, and the jury was given improper instruction. All those appeals were denied.

In his last statement, Feldman blamed his victims for crimes and said, "I hereby sentence them both to death, which I carried out in August 1998," according to a statement from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.

Jason January, who prosecuted the case in Dallas County, said Feldman was "the poster child for the death penalty," because of his violent past.

Feldman was riding his motorcycle on a highway in Plano, Texas, when Everett's truck cut him off, the Attorney General's report said.

An enraged Feldman fired several shots into the back of the trailer before he reloaded, pulled up next to the truck cab and fired into Everett's window, killing him, the report said.

He checked to make sure Everett, 36, was dead before continuing home, according to the report. Forty-five minutes later, Feldman saw another 18-wheeler and the driver, 62-year-old Velasquez, fueling up at a gas station.

Feldman pulled into the station, killed Velasquez with two gunshots to the back and drove home, the report said.

Authorities said one week later Feldman shot Antonio Vega three times as he was standing outside a fast-food restaurant. Vega survived and a witness turned in Feldman's license plate number. Feldman's gun matched the weapon used in the shootings of all three men, the report said.

At trial, Feldman testified that the shootings were a result of his anger at Everett for cutting him off and said "he had shot Mr. Velasquez because the man was standing beside an eighteen-wheeler, which caused Feldman to 'explode again in anger,'" according to the attorney general's report.

Feldman is the 21st person executed in the United States this year and the 11th in Texas, which has put to death more people than any other state since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976.

byline: By Joseph Menn
8:31am EDT

National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander jousted with a few hecklers as he defended the U.S. spy agency's surveillance programs at the Black Hat security conference on Wednesday, but largely kept the crowd of cybersecurity experts and hackers on his side.

"Read the Constitution!" one heckler shouted at the 61-year-old four-star general as he responded to polite but tough questions selected in advance by conference organizers.

"I have. So should you," Alexander shot back, triggering sustained applause.

The four-star general, who wore uniform shirt sleeves, was the opening keynote speaker at the annual convention in Las Vegas, which drew about 7,000 cybersecurity experts and hackers from the private and public sectors.

Alexander has been under fire from many civil liberties advocates and lawmakers since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents revealing previously secret telephone and internet surveillance programs run by the U.S. government.

Snowden, facing U.S. criminal charges and holed up in Russia, disclosed details on how the NSA gathers and stores telephone calling records of virtually all Americans, and works closely with Google Inc, Microsoft Corp and other technology companies to obtain communications from users in other countries.

The NSA is the U.S. spy agency that monitors foreign electronic communications.

The NSA protects some of the companies represented at the conference and hires some of their best employees. At the same time, many security experts have profound enthusiasm for the causes of internet freedom and privacy.

Alexander's comments in Las Vegas did not go beyond those he previously gave before Congress and at other public appearances in the past two months. He argued that the NSA surveillance programs helped disrupt more than 50 "terrorist-related" plots but said he supported wider discussions on how to balance national security priorities with privacy rights.

Alexander, who is also in charge of the U.S. Cyber Command that handles military cyberspace operations, said the NSA initially examined only several hundred phone numbers, then looked outward to see who else those people had spoken to.

His tone was mostly conciliatory, though he asserted that allegations of indiscriminate eavesdropping by the NSA had not been borne out by a Senate committee investigation, internal audits or reviews by administration officials.

"We get all these allegations of what they could be doing, but when people check, like the intelligence committee, they found no times" that NSA internet surveillance had been willfully abused, he said.

OVERSEAS BUSINESSES

The furor over the NSA surveillance programs threatens the overseas business of some U.S. companies, as technology buyers look to local alternatives to replace U.S. services that can be intercepted.

The first question from the audience for Alexander after his conference speech was whether he believes the NSA is hurting the ability of U.S. technology companies to compete for foreign customers. He said that companies should be able to disclose how little they actually turn over, as the industry is asking to do.

Alexander also said the vast majority of countries have similar "lawful intercept" programs and the NSA's version was an unusually good model because it was subject to U.S. court review, albeit in secret.

Though not as critical as Congress and the courts, the security professionals at Black Hat still represent a key audience for Alexander. "This is the greatest center of technical gravity in the world," he said of his audience. "It is important that we put the facts on the table."

Black Hat conferences bring together corporate, government and independent cybersecurity experts including some hackers.

Because information on so many Americans is subject to collection without any suspicion of wrongdoing, Snowden's revelations have provoked a large privacy outcry.

"I've never sensed this level of tension or apprehension in the community," said Black Hat founder Jeff Moss. He recalled the debate over U.S. restrictions on cryptography exports in the 1990s but said that "pales in comparison" to the fight about mass communications interception now underway.

The U.S. House of Representatives voted last week not to cut funding for the NSA's calling-records program.

The U.S. government on Wednesday released some declassified documents on the NSA's mass collection of telephone data.

The documents included an April order by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that directed Verizon to hand over data from millions of Americans' telephone calls and described how the data should be stored and accessed.



headline: Illinois judge rules Chicago can close schools

An Illinois judge on Wednesday allowed Chicago to proceed with the closing of 50 public schools by denying a request from the teachers' union to keep 10 of them open.

A lawsuit filed by the Chicago Teachers' Union argued that the school district ignored the recommendations of independent officials questioning 10 of the proposed closings.

"This unfortunate ruling ... does an injustice to the parents of these students," Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis said in a statement.

Parents backed by the union have other litigation objecting to the closings pending in federal court. Attorneys for the union and parents are considering an appeal in the state case, according to attorney Josiah Groff.

The Chicago Board of Education voted last May to close 50 schools, including about 10 percent of all elementary schools, in the largest mass school closing in the nation.

The closings in mainly Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods have drawn protests by parents and union leaders, who say they will expose children to greater gang violence in a city that recorded 506 murders in 2012.

Officials at the nation's third-largest school district have defended the proposed closings, saying they are necessary to help the district reduce the budget deficit and better distribute resources.

"Though this process has not been without its pain, we stand committed to working with parents, educators and the community to ensure every child can live up to their potential," said Barbara Byrd-Bennett, CPS CEO, in a statement.

Urban school districts have been grappling with declining enrollment across the country, and 70 cities have closed schools over the past decade.

Chicago's public schools last week forecast a record $1 billion fiscal 2014 budget deficit, despite the closings and the layoffs of 1,000 teachers, prompting one credit agency to downgrade the school system's debt rating.

The district blamed the deficit on an expected sharp rise in annual pension payments for teachers because the state of Illinois has failed to curb ballooning pension costs.



headline: 'Rosie the Riveter' World War Two bomber plant needs $8 million to live on as museum

month lease on life while a campaign tries to raise $8 million to save it from a wrecking ball.

The Willow Run Bomber Plant campaign, founded by the Michigan Aerospace Foundation and the Yankee Air Museum, has until October 1 to find the money that will allow it to separate and preserve a small part of the Willow Run plant in Ypsilanti Township, about 40 miles west of Detroit.

The idea is to relocate an air museum to the site, which is adjacent to Willow Run Airport.

The property is held by the Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response trust (RACER), which was created to sell real estate that was given up by General Motors Co during its 2009 bankruptcy proceedings. GM built transmissions there after the war.

The Willow Run Bomber Plant campaign said it has raised more than $4.5 million. The initial funding deadline was August 1, but the extension was granted because it would not interfere with the planned demolition of the factory, said Bruce Rasher, redevelopment manager for the RACER trust.

"We're very hopeful that the Yankee Air Museum is successful in their efforts," Rasher said. "If they are, there will be a small piece of history preserved at the site in conjunction with what we expect will be a state-of-the-art manufacturing and research facility."

ROSIE STEPS INTO HISTORY

Rosie the Riveter was introduced to the world in a song by the same name that was recorded by big band leader Kay Kyser. American illustrator Norman Rockwell further immortalized Rosie on the May 29, 1943 cover of the Saturday Evening Post.

Rosie the Riveter was promoted by the U.S. government as a way of bringing women out of their homes and into the factories that were building planes, tanks and armaments for the United States and its allies.

She was depicted on posters and other war-era literature and products with her right arm flexed to show muscle and her hair tucked under a red print scarf. Rosie's message was clear: American women were ready and able to fill jobs that had been done by men who had gone to war.

The character found human counterparts on assembly lines all over the United States. According to the Ford Motor Co, which built and operated the Willow Run factory, the song was inspired by Rosalind P. Walter, but one of Ford's workers, Rose Will Monroe, became most closely associated with the fictional Rosie.

Monroe was a riveter at the Willow Run Aircraft Factory, where thousands of B-24 Liberator bombers were built. According to Ford, Monroe best fit the song's description of Rosie and so she was asked to star in a promotional film about the war effort at home. The rest is, well, history.

One of the most highly recognizable characters to emerge from the World War Two era, Rosie's "can do" image is still widely reproduced.

After the war, the Kaiser-Frazer Corp bought the plant, then sold it to General Motors in 1953.

FLYING FORTRESS RISES FOR THE CAUSE

Rasher declined to provide a time frame for when the trust might sell the site or to name any companies looking at it.

Earlier in July, to drum up media coverage, local reporters were given a ride on the Yankee Air Museum's historic B-17 "Yankee Lady" Flying Fortress bomber.

If the campaign meets its fundraising goal, it would preserve 175,000 square feet of the 4 million-square-foot facility. The southeast section of the factory, where planes were driven off the assembly line through towering bay doors, would be saved, said Dennis Norton, founder of the Yankee Air Museum.

Norton said the RACER trust has worked closely with the campaign, even reconfiguring some of its engineering and demolition plans to save the museum about $2 million.

He said the effort to preserve the plant was drawing attention to Detroit's wartime production efforts, when the city was known as the "Arsenal of Democracy." Detroit is facing a financial crisis so severe that it has filed for bankruptcy protection.

"It is a bright spot in all the stuff that's going on in Detroit right now," Norton said.



headline: Crews battle wildfires threatening homes in Pacific Northwest

Firefighters in Washington state and Oregon were grappling on Wednesday with blazes that have blackened more than 200 square miles of terrain across the Pacific Northwest, forcing hundreds of residents to flee their homes.

In Washington, some 1,700 firefighters worked to contain a pair of fires that have charred a combined 85,000 acres east of the Cascade Range, destroying at least three homes and several outbuildings, said state Emergency Management Division spokesman Mark Clemens.

The so-called Colockum Tarps fire, which broke out on Saturday morning and quickly spread through dry brush near Malaga, had burned over some 60,000 acres of mountain slopes toward the Columbia River by Wednesday afternoon, Clemens said.

Air tankers have dropped water and flame retardant to protect neighborhoods and power lines, he said. The Colockum, only about 8 percent contained, has forced 150 people to evacuate their homes south of Wenatchee.

Clemens said crews had managed to contain around 60 percent of the second blaze, known as the Mile Marker 28 fire, that erupted on July 24 and quickly spread over 26,000 acres, prompting the evacuation of 69 homes. Those residents were allowed to return home as of Wednesday.

Officials said the causes of the fires were under investigation, and that they were worried about lightning-bearing thunderstorms forecast for Thursday that could ignite new blazes.

In southwestern Oregon, meanwhile, a wildfire started by lightning on July 26 that had already burned over more than 25,000 acres was threatening 500 homes. Although the flames were only about 5 percent contained, officials said they had made headway on Wednesday.

Dubbed the Douglas Complex fire, it is made up of four large fires and 55 smaller blazes.

Christie Shaw, public information officer with the Oregon Department of Forestry, said 105 homes have been evacuated and 40 more are on notice. Forty commercial buildings, 470 homes and 35 outbuildings are threatened by the fire. She said only a couple of outbuildings and two railroad trestles had been destroyed so far.

A few minor injuries have been reported among the 1,387 firefighters and support personnel battling the blaze, officials said. Crews were using 11 helicopters, 86 fire trucks, 15 bulldozers and 27 water tenders.

Marv Eells, owner of Glendale Hardware in nearby Glendale, said his store had completely sold out of garden hoses and was doing a brisk business in flashlight batteries and particle masks.

The weather has helped firefighters, with temperatures in the low 80s and 30 percent humidity. Thunderstorms are expected over the next few days, which could mean a small amount of rain as well as more lightening strikes.

The area historically was a gold-mining region and still produces timber. About half the land is privately owned and half is owned by the federal Bureau of Land Management.



headline: Private at U.S. Army base in Colorado base arrested on sex charge

old girl he met on the Internet has been arrested amid an ongoing probe of sexual misconduct at the post, police said on Wednesday

Mark Vincent Petrosky, a private assigned to the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, was arrested by Colorado Springs police on Tuesday on suspicion of sexual assault of a child, police said in a written statement.

The arrest came a week after Fort Carson officials said they were investigating allegations that several soldiers at the base had engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls.

Police spokeswoman Barbara Miller said she could not confirm if Petrosky was among those being investigated by military authorities but that the case "involved similar patterns" as the Army probe. The alleged incident did not occur on the military installation.

A Fort Carson spokeswoman would not say if Petrosky was one of the targets of their investigation.

The arrest is the latest development in a series of sexual misconduct allegations in the armed forces. A study released by the Pentagon in May said reports of unwanted sexual contact in the military rose by more than one-third between 2011 and 2012.

Police in the Petrosky case said the girl told detectives that she met Petrosky on a website and the pair exchanged text messages over a period of several weeks earlier this year.

Ultimately, they met in person and had a sexual encounter in Petrosky's vehicle in a parking lot adjacent to a city lake that is not on the military post, police said.

Separately, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office is conducting its own investigation into another Fort Carson soldier suspected of having sex with a minor.

Lieutenant Jeff Kramer described that probe as "underneath the umbrella" of the military investigations, but no arrests have been made.

Petrosky, who is listed in Army records as a "Bradley Fighting Vehicle system maintainer" with the 3rd Brigade Armored Combat Team, is being held on a $16,000 bond, according to jail records.

He has been in the Army for one year and his hometown is listed as Landing, New Jersey.

degree death by automobile, court officials said on Wednesday.

Idowu Daramola, 48, was talking on his cellphone when he lost control of the Sphinx Transportation bus around 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday in West New York, New Jersey, the Hudson County Sheriff's Office said. He was being held on $250,000 bail.

If convicted of all charges, Daramola could face 10 years in prison.

On Tuesday, he was issued a summons for using a cell phone while driving, which is punishable by a maximum fine of $100 for a first offense.

The bus jumped a curb and struck a lamppost, knocking it onto a baby carriage and causing fatal injuries to 8-month-old Angela Paredes, the sheriff's office said.

The bus also hit a parked car, which then smashed into several other parked cars, including one with four passengers, who were injured, authorities said.

When police arrived at the scene, the baby was bleeding from the head and did not have a pulse, according to the sheriff's office. An officer attempted to revive her, but the child was pronounced dead on the way to the hospital.

The baby's mother, Maylin Hogo, of North Bergen, was hospitalized for shock but was otherwise not injured, the sheriff's office said.

Daramola, of Thornwood, New York, will make his first court appearance on Thursday in Jersey City, New Jersey. Authorities in the sheriff's office did not know whether Daramola has an attorney.



headline: Hunger strike at Guantanamo Bay shows signs of weakening
byline: By Jane Sutton
8:31am EDT

thirds of its 166 prisoners has tapered off with a Ramadan pardon that has allowed some prisoners to be together during Islam's holy month.

Military jailers said the camp was stable and calm after recent upheavals but did not know if the hunger strike would revive when the traditionally quiet period of Ramadan ends on August 7 and normal routines resume.

The force-feeding of hunger-strikers has made global headlines and pressured President Barack Obama to act on a lapsed vow to shut down the camp on the U.S. Naval Base.

"It (the strike) did work. It got everybody talking," said the camp's cultural adviser, a Jordanian native who goes by the name Zak and works with prisoners and camp commanders.

In the last two months the Obama administration has cleared two Algerian prisoners for repatriation, appointed a new State Department envoy to negotiate resettlement of others and announced plans to start long-promised parole-type reviews for those it does not plan to try because it has no admissible evidence linking them to specific attacks.

President Barack Obama will meet on Thursday in Washington with Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to discuss the return of 56 Yemeni prisoners who were cleared for transfer years ago but whose repatriation was blocked because of concerns about instability in their homeland.

The current hunger strike began in February after guards seized family photos, legal documents and other belongings during what was described as a routine cell search. Prisoners accused the guards of mishandling Korans, which camp officials denied.

By mid-April, 43 prisoners had joined the strike, and a few occasionally passed out from dehydration or low blood sugar, a senior medical officer said.

Thirteen had grown so thin that Navy medics were keeping them alive by force-feeding them high-protein shakes via tubes inserted in their nostrils and threaded into their stomachs. Guards strapped them into chairs to prevent resistance.

Prisoners who had long lived in communal cellblocks began refusing to return to their cells at night, covered their windows with protest signs and put cereal boxes over the cameras to obscure the view of guards, camp officials said. Others splashed guards with urine and feces, something that hadn't happened at the prison in recent memory.

Military SWAT teams in riot gear moved in on April 13 and forced inmates back into their cells. A few fought back with broomsticks, and guards fired rubber pellets to control them. Five were hurt in the scuffle, camp officials said.

The hunger strike ratcheted up steadily after that, peaking in early July, with 106 taking part and 46 force-fed at least some of their meals.

When Ramadan began on July 8, camp commanders pardoned all disciplinary infractions and allowed some detainees to return to communal housing.

"Everyone got the slate wiped clean," said Lieutenant Colonel Samuel House, a spokesman for the detention operation.

About 100 who abandoned the hunger strike or never took part have now earned their way back into group housing by following camp rules. They can eat, pray and mingle in groups for five to 18 hours a day before being locked in their cells overnight.

Art and language classes, which were halted with the April raid, have resumed and television-watching privileges have been restored to more prisoners as order returned during Ramadan.

"It's like night and day," said Army Sergeant 1st Class Vernon Branson, a senior watch commander in one of the prisons.

way glass, they looked adequately fed.

Out of sight were the hunger strikers. Camp officials have decided to lock them in single cells until they resume eating, renounce the hunger strike and pass a medical exam.

Yemeni prisoner Samir Moqbel, who is among 86 captives cleared for release in 2010, said he was beaten and forced back into a solitary cell as punishment for refusing to abandon his hunger strike.

"We are protesting," Moqbel said through his attorney, Cori Crider of the human rights group Reprieve. "There are people who have been here for 11 years and are cleared to go. In fact, if you look at the people that they have cleared, that means they are not criminals. They are being kept for no reason."

Camp officials deny anyone was beaten and insist they are not trying to break the hunger strike. They said strikers are kept in single cells so that guards who deliver their food trays can keep track of how much they eat.

The hunger strike had dwindled to 66 participants by Wednesday, with 42 being tube-fed at least some of the time, House said. Nurses, medics and camp officials said all the hunger strikers eat occasional meals.

Prisoners' lawyers accuse the military of downplaying the hunger strike, while camp officials accuse the prisoners and their advocates of exaggerating it for political effect.

"We're not the bad people. But the whole world makes it like we're the bad people and they're the good people," said Zak, the cultural adviser.

He said "instigators and troublemakers" among the prisoners had pledged that there would never be an end to the hunger strikes. "We'll be like the thorn in your throats," Zak quoted them as saying.

About five prisoners have been on a near-constant hunger strike for eight years. Medics who have tube-feed them to keep them alive say the hunger strike is a protest against indefinite detention and not a suicide attempt.

"Starvation is a terrible way to die. No one wants that," said Petty Officer 3rd Class Michael, a Navy hospital corpsman who didn't want his full name used.

Some of the chronic long-term hunger strikers have suffered osteoporosis and bowel problems as a result of extended fasting, and are at risk of heart damage, a medical officer at the detainee hospital said.

The officers at Guantanamo are waiting to see whether the burst of attention from Washington will produce a concrete plan to shut down the camp, as Obama said he would do by 2010.

Some staff at the base have suggested the prisoners might end the hunger strike if they see transfers resuming. Rear Admiral Richard Butler, who took command of the detention operation two weeks ago, isn't so sure.

"It could be goodness for everybody or it could just increase the appetite for more rapid action by everybody," he said.

Arkansas authorities were searching on Wednesday for an inmate who escaped from jail by slithering through a service window while another prisoner diverted the attention of guards.

According to the Garland County Sheriff's office, Derrick Estell was in a visitation room talking on a phone at the Garland County Detention Center over the weekend when another inmate, William Harding, diverted the guard's attention by asking questions.

The guards left the area to look up the answers to the questions. When they did so, Estell squeezed through the window and ran to a waiting car owned by Harding and driven by Tamara Upshaw. The sheriff's office now has a warrant out for her arrest.

"Investigators have reason to believe that others are involved in the planned escape and are working to confirm the information received and issue warrants for their arrest," the sheriff's office said in a statement.

Before escaping, Estell was being held in jail awaiting trial on 26 charges including burglary, theft and drug-related offenses.

Authorities said those who assisted could include "family members, friends and other inmates of both the Garland County Detention Center and Arkansas Department of Corrections."

The incident was the second escape in recent days in Arkansas. Two inmates at the Jackson County jail in Newport escaped through a hole in a ceiling of the cell they shared on Monday. One of the inmates was captured in the woods near the jail on Monday night, Jackson County Sheriff David Lucas said.

The other inmate was killed on Tuesday when the car he was driving crashed and burned as he fled police pursuing him in Shannon County, Missouri, Lucas said.

headline: New Snowden leak upstages U.S. move to declassify documents

8:31am EDT

New revelations from former security contractor Edward Snowden that U.S. intelligence agencies have access to a vast online tracking tool came to light on Wednesday, as lawmakers put the secret surveillance programs under greater scrutiny.

The Guardian, citing documents from Snowden, published National Security Agency training materials for the XKeyscore program, which the British newspaper described as the NSA's widest-reaching system that covers "nearly everything a typical user does on the Internet."

Intelligence analysts can conduct surveillance through XKeyscore by filling in an on-screen form giving only a "broad justification" for the search and no review by a court or NSA staff, the newspaper said.

Snowden's disclosures to media that U.S. intelligence agencies collected data on phone calls and other communications of Americans and foreign citizens as a tool to fight terrorism have sparked uproar in the United States and abroad.

Intelligence officials insist the surveillance programs helped thwart terrorist attacks and saved many American lives.

"The implication that NSA's collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false," the agency said in a statement in response to the Guardian's new report, calling XKeyscore part of "NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system."

Opposition to the sweeping surveillance has been gaining traction in Congress, despite intense lobbying on the intelligence agencies' behalf from the Obama administration, congressional leaders and members of the House of Representatives and Senate Intelligence Committees.

President Barack Obama scheduled a meeting for Thursday with Republican and Democratic lawmakers, including the leaders of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives Intelligence Committees, to discuss programs under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a White House official said on Wednesday.

Intelligence officials were grilled at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday about their data gathering, the lack of transparency and security lapses that let Snowden get away with so much information.

SENATE, HOUSE LEGISLATION

Two Democratic members of the committee, Senators Al Franken and Richard Blumenthal, said they would introduce legislation on Thursday to force the Obama administration to provide more information about the data collection programs, including how many Americans' records were reviewed by federal agents.

"The government has to give proper weight to both keeping America safe from terrorists and protecting Americans' privacy," Franken said.

Senior intelligence officials at the hearing said they were open to making some changes in the system.

Keith Alexander, the NSA director, jousted with hecklers at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday as he defended the U.S. spy agency's surveillance programs before a crowd of cybersecurity experts and hackers.

"Read the Constitution!" one shouted. But the four-star general replied: "I have. So should you," to sustained applause.

Last week, the House defeated by a narrow 217-205 margin a bill that would have cut funding of the NSA program that collects the phone records. Strong support for the measure - bolstered by an unlikely alliance of liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans - surprised many observers.

Snowden, who has been charged under the U.S. Espionage Act and had his passport revoked, left Hong Kong more than a month ago and is stuck in limbo at a Moscow airport while seeking asylum in Russia, which has refused to extradite him.

"If a 29-year-old school dropout could come in and take out massive, massive amounts of data, it's obvious there weren't adequate controls," Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, the committee chairman, said at the hearing. "Has anybody been fired?"

John Inglis, the NSA's deputy director, said no one had been dismissed and no one had offered to resign.

GOVERNMENT DECLASSIFIES DOCUMENTS

The director of national intelligence released three declassified documents on Wednesday in the "interest of increased transparency." They explained the bulk collection of phone data - one of the secret programs revealed by Snowden.

Much of what is in the newly declassified documents has already been divulged in public hearings by intelligence officials. The released documents included 2009 and 2011 reports on the NSA's "Bulk Collection Program," carried out under the U.S. Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism legislation passed shortly after the September 11, 2001, attacks.

They also included an April 2013 order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which directed communications company Verizon to hand over data from millions of Americans' telephone calls. The declassified documents said the data would only be used when needed for authorized searches.

"Although the programs collect a large amount of information, the vast majority of that information is never reviewed by anyone in the government, because the information is not responsive to the limited queries that are authorized for intelligence purposes," the 2009 report said.

But the secret NSA slide show from 2008, posted by the Guardian on its website, showed that XKeyscore allowed analysts to access databases that collect and index online activity around the world, including searching for email addresses, extracted files, phone numbers or chat activity.



headline: Misconduct allegations rise for U.S. airport security workers

8:31am EDT

Misconduct allegations increased 26 percent against U.S. airport security employees in the past three years, half of them over attendance and security issues, a government report said, but a workers' union said its members had "a strong record."

The report said that the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA), created after the September 11, 2001 hijacked plane attacks, lacks comprehensive systems to ensure employees follow its rules.

The report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office said 3,408 misconduct allegations were filed against TSA workers last year, up from 2,691 in 2010.

TSA said in a statement that the agency followed the "highest ethical standards" and had "zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace."

A review was carried out as a series of news reports in recent years highlighted allegations of misconduct by TSA employees across the United States.

Thirty two percent of the incidents involved attendance issues and 20 percent involved violations of security standards, the report said. Others were about drug and alcohol use by agents while on duty and inconsistent use of security devices such as X-ray machines.

A TSA union lawyer, David Borer, called the report "much ado about nothing" for 56,000 employees. He said "with about 3,000 misconduct allegations a year, that's 600 that involve security or .01 percent involved in security incidents."

"Anywhere else, that would be considered a strong record," Borer said.



headline: U.S. man convicted of al Qaeda support says his free speech was violated
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

Lawyers for a Massachusetts man convicted a year and a half ago of conspiring to support al Qaeda have claimed that prosecutors prejudiced the jury with videos of beheadings and that the judge who sentenced him violated his right to free speech.

Tarek Mehanna was found guilty in December 2011 on seven counts that included providing material support to terrorists, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country and lying to law enforcement officers.

He was sentenced by U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in April, 2012 to 17-1/2 years in prison.

Mehanna's appeal began on Tuesday, with his attorneys charging that his conviction and sentencing were the result of "overwhelming prejudice" stemming from evidence that included videos of beheadings. Their client, they argued, had merely watched the videos years earlier.

"The purpose of the evidence was to frighten the jury, and it worked," said defense attorney Sabin Willett. "This was the theme, the drumbeat of the trial."

At trial, prosecutors had said that Mehanna, who holds a doctorate from the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, answered a call to action from Osama bin Laden to fight U.S. soldiers.

They said he traveled to Yemen in 2004 to seek terrorism training, but never received it, and planned to travel to Iraq to fight U.S. troops. They also accused him of translating videos and texts from Arabic to English and distributing them on the Internet to further al Qaeda's cause.

Defense attorneys had countered that Mehanna was "a typical American kid" trying to learn about his Muslim heritage by studying Islamic law and translating classical texts. He traveled to Yemen to visit schools where he hoped to study, they said.

Willett, the defense attorney, said on Tuesday that when he returned to the United States from Yemen, Mehanna simply did a lot of talking and proselytizing, "which he's allowed to do under the First Amendment."

More than two years after his return to the United States, he made offensive remarks about a video, "expressing his anger in words, which is his birthright," the attorney said.

Willett also challenged the chronology of events presented by the government and said the only thing Mehanna had been asked to translate was a "boring" religious text that had nothing to do with violence.

He said the jury had been "infected with prejudice" and a "conflation of conspiracies."

Prosecutor Liza Collery said the evidence was brought for "a variety of purposes," and that "propaganda was critical to these crimes" because Mehanna had used it to radicalize others.

She said Mehanna had been portrayed by his attorneys as a scholarly man seeking enlightenment, but that the evidence showed otherwise.

Mehanna, a U.S. citizen from Sudbury, Massachusetts, maintained his innocence at his sentencing at U.S. District Court in Boston last year, telling the judge he "never plotted to kill Americans at shopping malls or anywhere else."

The judge said he was troubled by Mehanna's lack of remorse and sentenced him to 17-and-a-half years behind bars followed by seven years of supervised release. The maximum penalty was life in prison.

sex nuptials.

The Montgomery County Register of Wills, D. Bruce Hanes, an elected official who issues marriage licenses, has been processing them for couples of the same gender for the past week, said county spokesman Frank Custer.

"I decided to come down on the right side of history and the law and was prepared to issue a license to the couple," Hanes said in a statement.

The state Health Department, part of the administration of Governor Tom Corbett, a Republican, on Tuesday filed a lawsuit seeking to stop Hanes.

"The clerk's actions are in direct defiance of the express policy of the commonwealth that marriage shall be between one man and one woman," said the lawsuit filed in state Commonwealth Court.

The lawsuit comes less than two weeks after Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane, a Democrat, announced she would not defend the state's ban on same sex marriage. She refused to fight a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which was believed to be the first federal case since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 26 that the U.S. government must recognize same-sex marriages in states where it is legal.

Corbett's Office of General Counsel said on Tuesday it would step in to defend the state's ban on gay marriage.

Pennsylvania's Defense of Marriage Act was amended in 1996 to ban same-sex nuptials and to void same-sex marriages of state residents that might have been recognized in another state.

Thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia recognize gay marriage. Among them, Delaware, Minnesota and Rhode Island legalized gay marriage this year. Pennsylvania is among six potential states targeted by gay marriage advocates for a future push to legalize same sex nuptials in 2015 and 2016, according to Freedom to Marry advocacy group.

In Montgomery County, Hanes' decision to provide the marriage licenses was hailed by the two Democrats who sit on the three-member Board of Commissioners, which governs Montgomery County. The third member, a Republican, said on Facebook the controversy belonged in court.

Hanes began issuing the licenses at the request of a same-sex couple who ultimately decided not to marry.

Montgomery County Solicitor Ray McGarry will file a response to the lawsuit sometime after Wednesday, Custer said.

"In the meantime the Register of Wills office will continue to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples," McGarry said in a statement on Tuesday.

The county, with a population of more than 800,000, borders Philadelphia.

A severe stomach illness linked to prepackaged salad has struck two new patients in Iowa, state health officials said on Wednesday, as the bug spread through 16 states.

The salad mix has been blamed for most of the 145 total cases in Iowa and the 78 in Nebraska of the rare parasite cyclospora, which causes gastrointestinal illness. The two states account for nearly two-thirds of at least 378 cases in the United States since mid-June.

The cause of outbreaks in other states is still under investigation, but officials with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they are working to determine whether the prepackaged salad mix, the brand name of which has not been released, is responsible for outbreaks in states from New York and New Jersey to Florida and Texas.

At least 21 people have been hospitalized in three states with the bug, CDC officials said.

Symptoms caused by the one-cell parasite include watery diarrhea, vomiting and body aches. The virus is commonly associated with contaminated fresh produce and can be difficult to wash off.

Officials in Iowa and Nebraska said the salad mix was distributed nationally and there is no indication that local produce was involved in the outbreak.

The mix, sold as prewashed and ready to eat, was described by health officials as a combination of iceberg lettuce, carrots and red cabbage.

The product has been pulled from the shelves in Iowa and appears to have been consumed by the stricken residents in mid-June, health officials said. It was unclear whether the product had been removed from distribution in Nebraska.

Nebraska health officials said earlier this week that the same salad mix appeared to be responsible for the outbreak there as well.

New cases are being reported in Nebraska daily, officials there said, but it is unlikely that the same batch is still on shelves or in refrigerators, as the product's shelf life is short.

Cyclosporiasis symptoms usually manifest within several days of eating the contaminated food, and include diarrhea, cramps, nausea and fatigue. If not treated, the illness may last from a few days to a month or longer and patients have been known to relapse, the CDC said.

The first cases were reported in Iowa in late June, with the majority of the illnesses logged in early July. The CDC has not released the age range of those infected, but said it was working closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state officials to gather more information.



headline: Miami gunman called 911 hours before shooting rampage

area apartment building called 911 hours beforehand and said he believed he was being followed and that someone was performing witchcraft on him, according to a copy of the call released on Wednesday.

A SWAT team stormed the apartment building in a raid early Saturday, killing the gunman, Pedro Alberto Vargas, after he set his apartment on fire, went on a shooting rampage and took two people hostage.

In a 12-minute 911 call released by police, Vargas asked an operator to check a license plate of a vehicle he said was outside of the building.

"There is a car parked outside and I'd like you to run a check because it doesn't belong to anyone who lives here," Vargas said.

He told the dispatcher he believed that someone was following him.

"Somebody is trying to do witchcraft against me," he said.

Police are trying to identify a motive in the shooting, the worst to hit the Miami area since 1982. The victims included an elderly couple who were the apartment building's managers and four neighbors, including a 17-year-old girl.

The call was placed about five hours before Vargas fired his first shot and provides some clues about his state of mind at the time.

Vargas, a 42-year-old graphic artist who arrived in the United States from Cuba six years ago, lived with his 83-year-old mother in an apartment in the Miami suburb of Hialeah.

Pressed by the dispatcher about who was behind the witchcraft, he responded, "a lawyer."

An attorney said on Wednesday that he questioned Vargas last week in connection with an investigation by Bullet Line, a promotional company where Vargas once worked.

The company was trying to determine the identity of a person who had sent abusive emails and text messages to several employees, the lawyer, Angel Castillo, said.

After initially denying he was responsible for the messages, Vargas admitted he sent them and later wrote an email to a company official apologizing. The company decided not to pursue any other legal action against Vargas, Castillo said.

"His messages were not threatening, but personally offensive and harassing," Castillo said in a statement.

Vargas returned to the lawyer's office three days later, more than an hour after he placed the 911 call. Castillo said he was not there at the time, but Vargas did not make any hostile or threatening remarks.

On Tuesday, a Miami college where Vargas once worked said he was forced to resign in 2008 from his job in the school's media services department after authorities found he downloaded files with links to bomb making and counterfeiting.

During the 911 call, an emergency operator requested to speak to Vargas' mother, Esperanza Patterson. She said her son suffered from emotional problems and appeared nervous.

Patterson said she slipped some medication in his food to calm him down and that she had encouraged Vargas to seek treatment with a psychiatrist.

"He is a good man," she said. "But he is traumatized."

Patterson told the operator Vargas left the apartment while she was on the phone.

Asked if she wanted police to come to the apartment as her son had requested, Patterson said no.

"He'll get angry," she said.

George Zimmerman, a volunteer watchman whose acquittal in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin led to protests, was pulled over by police in Texas on Sunday for speeding, officials said on Wednesday.

Zimmerman told the officer that he had a weapon in his glove compartment and was going "nowhere in particular," said Brian Brooks, city manager of Forney, Texas, about 25 miles southeast of Dallas, where Zimmerman was stopped.

The gun in the glove box is legal in Texas, and police routinely ask motorists if they have weapons in the car, Brooks said. He said the entire stop lasted less than five minutes.

"It wasn't for super-excessive speeds, they just got him on regular speeding," Brooks said. "It's a pretty routine stop except for the fact that it was George Zimmerman."

Zimmerman was released when it was determined that he had no warrants.

Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter on July 13 in Florida after a racially charged trial in the shooting of Martin in February 2012. Thousands of people demonstrated across the United States after the verdict.

Zimmerman, who was a volunteer neighborhood watchman in the central Florida town of Sanford, Florida at the time of the shooting, said he acted in self-defense.



headline: Ohio man accused of killing three women pleads not guilty
byline: By Kim Palmer

A man authorities have compared to an Ohio serial killer pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges he killed three women and left their bodies wrapped in plastic bags near his suburban Cleveland apartment.

Michael Madison, 35, appeared in a Cleveland courtroom on 14 charges including aggravated murder, rape and kidnapping. Two of the victims were strangled, authorities said. The cause of death of the third has not yet been determined.

During his initial interrogation, law enforcement officials said that Madison invoked the name of Anthony Sowell, a notorious Cleveland man convicted in 2011 for raping and murdering 11 women by strangling them with shoe laces, cords and clothing. Sowell is on death row.

Sowell buried some of the bodies of his victims in his backyard, leaving others unburied and wrapped in plastic bags in different rooms of his home.

A grand jury on Monday indicted Madison. He was convicted of rape in 2002, according to court documents.

Prosecutors said they have not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty for Madison, who appeared before a judge via video on Wednesday, handcuffed and wearing a short-sleeved orange prison jumpsuit.

When asked how he was feeling, Madison told Cuyahoga County Judge Burneside, "I've been better."

Police found the bodies of Shirellda Terry, 18, Shetisha Sheeley, 28, and Angela Deskins, 38 wrapped in plastic bags beginning on July 19. Police discovered Terry's body on July 19 after neighbors complained of a foul stench coming from the garage behind Madison's East Cleveland apartment.

Madison was arrested after a two-hour stand-off with police and the bodies of the other women were discovered nearby.

Madison has been held on $6 million bail in the same prison as Ariel Castro, a former Cleveland school bus driver who pleaded guilty last week to kidnapping, raping and holding captive three women for about a decade. The women were freed from his house on May 6. Castro has agreed to accept a life prison term and will be formally sentenced on Thursday.



headline: Ex-agent recalls 'paranoia' about 'Whitey' Bulger's FBI connections

FBI files about mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger were locked into a fireproof safe in the bureau's Boston office to keep them from the prying eyes of corrupt agents who would leak them to criminals, a retired agent testified on Wednesday.

"I had (files) placed in a safe, I think it was even fireproof, in my office, and I could then lock the door of my office," ex-agent Fred Davis told the jury. Lawyers defending Bulger in his murder and racketeering trial had called him to the stand to buttress its case that Boston's FBI office was corrupt and mismanaged when it was investigating their client in the 1970s and 80s.

Bulger has been charged with participating in 19 murders while running the feared Winter Hill crime gang. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, although his attorneys have admitted he was involved in organized crime.

Bulger also has denied being an FBI informant. He says he paid agents for information, but never gave any of his own.

Davis said he was not the only one at the FBI's Boston office who worried that Bulger was getting tips from corrupt agents.

"I called it paranoia," Davis said before describing his method of keeping files secure. "There was concern there were agents in the office that might have been leaking information," he said, naming confessed corrupt former agents John Connolly and John Morris.

"When Connolly would walk into our squad area, some of our agents would really get nervous about him being there. It was like the bull getting into the China shop," he said.

Bulger's story has captured Boston's imagination for decades and revealed a dark period for the FBI, when corrupt agents who listed Bulger as an informant gave the mobster tips that helped him identify snitches and evade arrest for his gang's extortion, gambling rackets and drug smuggling.

Connolly is now serving a 40-year prison sentence after being convicted of racketeering and murder. Morris was granted immunity and testified against Bulger earlier in the trial.

Earlier on Wednesday, another former FBI agent, James Crawford said a female informant close to senior Winter Hill associate Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi had told him Flemmi wanted to kill Halloran for talking to the FBI. Crawford said he told his supervisor and other agents at the time but was told the tip would be put on the "back burner."

"At that time an FBI informant and an innocent victim were murdered," Bulger attorney J.W. Carney asked Crawford. "Yes," Crawford replied.

Halloran was killed in 1982 along with unintended victim Michael Donahue, and prosecutors contend Bulger was the gunman.

Prosecutors cross-examined Crawford, who admitted he had never been involved in any investigations related to Bulger.

Prosecutors put some of Bulger's closest partners in crime on the stand. They recalled an era when gun-toting gangsters dumped bodies under bridges or buried them in earthen basements and exchanged information with corrupt FBI agents in a bloody struggle for money and power.

Gangsters who confessed to participating in murder, John "The Executioner" Martorano, Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi and Kevin Weeks, vividly described Bulger strangling women, gunning down rivals and "rats" who talked too much, and demanding money at gunpoint from other criminals or local business owners.

Bulger fled Boston after a 1994 tip from a corrupt FBI official and spent 16 years as a fugitive before law enforcement caught him hiding out in a seaside apartment in California in 2011, with a stash of money and guns.

His attorneys plan to call a handful of witnesses starting on Monday, but they have not made clear whether Bulger, whose story inspired Martin Scorsese's Academy Award-winning film "The Departed," will take the stand himself.



headline: Changing Florida's Stand Your Ground law a tough hill to climb
byline: By Bill Cotterell

defense law.

Calling themselves "Dream Defenders", and inspired by the 1960s African-American civil rights movement, the protesters want to change a law they blame for the acquittal this month of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

Their nights of sleeping in blankets and living off fast food are unlikely to lead to a repeal or major reform of Stand Your Ground, political analysts say.

Such a move is virtually out of the question in Florida's Republican-dominated legislature, according to analysts.

"Gun rights are big, especially with the blue dog Democrats that Republicans need in Florida," said Lance deHaven-Smith, a political scientist at Florida State University. "This law is not repealable. Certainly not by the present legislature."

"RETURN TO THE WILD WEST"

The Zimmerman case sparked a debate on Stand Your Ground legislation that in 2005 amended the statute governing Florida's self-defense law. The amendment allows a person in fear of serious injury to use deadly force to defend themselves rather than retreat. Jurors in Florida said the law left them no option but to acquit Zimmerman for the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager.

Martin's grieving parents, backed by African-American civic leaders, students and politicians, including Attorney General Eric Holder and President Barack Obama, all say the Stand Your Ground law needs to be re-examined.

"By allowing â&euro;&rdquo; and perhaps encouraging â&euro;&rdquo; violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety," Holder told the convention of the NAACP earlier this month.

Some, including civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and singer Stevie Wonder, have gone further, calling for a boycott of Florida until the law is repealed.

Florida's self-defense law and the Zimmerman case are seen by many African Americans as emblematic of a lack of racial equality in the U.S. justice system. According to a study by the Tampa Bay Times, legal defense claims under Stand Your Ground were more likely to be successful when the victim was black.

Several groups, including the Martin family, say they are working on drawing up a Trayvon Martin Law to more narrowly define self-defense in cases that involve racial profiling.

The Dream Defenders - who have been joined in their nightly protest by the likes of activist/entertainer Harry Belafonte - say they won't leave until Florida Governor Rick Scott calls a special legislative session on the Stand Your Ground law.

Scott, a firm supporter of the law, is standing his ground and has rejected their demand after meeting them.

"This is just one tactic we have, focusing on the governor's office," said Phillip Agnew a young union activist from Miami who is the leader of the group. "We are also contacting legislators in their districts."

The National Bar Association, which represents African-American lawyers and judges, threw its weight behind the initiative on Monday and called for Scott to hold a special legislative session to review the Stand Your Ground law.

"Quite simply. You've given a license to kill, to shoot first and ask questions later. It's a return to the Wild West and Dodge City," said the association's president, John Page.

LAW'S SPONSOR TELLS FEDS "LEAVE US ALONE"

Florida became the first state in the country to adopt a Stand Your Ground law when it passed in 2005 with resounding bipartisan approval from Florida legislators, including some leading Democrats who now outspokenly oppose it.

Polls show the law still enjoys strong support in Florida and at least 21 states have since adopted similar laws, according to the National Council of State Legislatures.

Inspired by an outbreak of looting after a string of Florida hurricanes Florida in 2004, the law was meant to protect law-abiding citizens from prosecution for stopping a violent attack.

The law's leading sponsor says he has no regrets about the legislation despite the public outcry. Dennis Baxley, a conservative Republican state representative and staunch supporter of the National Rifle Association, said recent remarks by the president and Holder questioning the law were misplaced.

"It's not a federal issue and they need to leave us alone," Baxley, 60, told Reuters.

Advocates of the law say violent crime has fallen in the state since it was passed. At the same time, justifiable homicides in Florida have climbed to a record 66 cases in 2012 from an annual average of 13 between 2001 and 2005, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

After the Martin shooting, bills were introduced in Florida to repeal or scale-back the self-defense statute, but none even got a committee hearing.

Whatever happens in the legislature, Stand Your Ground is likely to remain a hot political issue headed into the 2014 electoral season. Democrats and Republicans are likely to make gun control and self-defense core issues, said Susan MacManus, a Tampa political scientist at the University of South Florida.

"One thing is for sure is that it's an issue that's not going to die down soon," she added.

Complaints against airport security workers have increased 26 percent in the past three years, and the U.S. Transportation Security Agency lacks comprehensive systems to ensure that its employees follow its rules, according to a government report.

The report, released ahead of congressional hearings on the TSA due to begin on Wednesday, said complaints included use of drugs and alcohol by TSA agents while on duty, and inconsistent use of security devices such as X-ray machines.

The report said 3,408 misconduct allegations were filed against TSA workers last year, up from 2,691 in 2010. Most concerned violations of attendance and security policies, the report by the Government Accountability Office found.

The TSA, created in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, lacks a comprehensive review process "to verify that TSA staff at airports are complying with policies and procedures for adjudicating employee misconduct," the report said.

The TSA, responding to the report, defended itself, saying in a statement that it followed the "highest ethical standards."

It said it had "zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace," and that rules violations could lead to loss of employment or referral to law enforcement authorities.

One of three men rescued from a filthy, converted garage in Houston where they were held captive and forced to hand over their veterans' benefit checks has died, police said on Tuesday.

William Greenawalt, 79, died on Thursday, six days after being rescued from a locked room with a barred door and windows. The room did not have a toilet or beds, police said.

The two other men, ages 59 and 64, were released from the hospital and into the care of an adult protective services agency, police said.

Walter Jones, 31, has been charged with two counts of causing serious bodily injury to the elderly.

Jones is suspected of luring the men to the house with promises of beer and cigarettes and then holding them against their will and forcing them to hand over their benefit checks.

Police said the men provided conflicting accounts about how long they have been at the house.

The discovery comes more than two months after three women were freed from a decade of imprisonment in a Cleveland, Ohio, house. In that case, Ariel Castro, a former school bus driver, pleaded guilty to abducting the women and starving, beating and sexually assaulting them. He also pleaded guilty to murder for causing one of the women to miscarry.

He faces life in prison without parole plus 1,000 years under a plea agreement reached with prosecutors. His sentencing is scheduled for Thursday.



headline: Amnesty International weighs in on California prisons hunger strike
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

old hunger strike in California prisons on Tuesday, calling solitary confinement conditions faced by protesting inmates an "affront to human rights" and urging an impartial probe into the death of a prisoner.

Billy Sell, 32, serving a life term for attempted murder, was found hanged in his cell July 22 in the "security housing unit" - for prisoners held in solitary confinement - at the Corcoran State Prison in central California.

The local coroner preliminarily ruled his death a suicide by strangulation, prison officials said. They added there was no evidence that Sell's participation in the hunger strike, which the corrections department initially denied, had been a factor.

According to inmate advocates, however, fellow prisoners reported Sell had been requesting medical attention for several days before his death, though a spokeswoman for a federal receiver overseeing state prison healthcare denied Sell was refused medical treatment.

In a statement issued late on Monday, corrections officials acknowledged that Sell had been on a hunger strike from at least July 11 - by which time he already had missed nine straight meals - until July 21, the day before his death.

They also said Sell was awaiting trial on murder charges and facing the death penalty if convicted in the 2007 strangulation and stabbing death of a cell mate. A source close to the corrections probe said he hung himself with a bed sheet.

Several entities at the state, federal and local level are reviewing the circumstances surrounding Sell's death, which inmate advocates say was preventable and points to inhumane conditions that protesting inmates claim to suffer.

The global human rights group Amnesty International joined inmate supporters from the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition in calling for an independent inquiry into the death, one that is thoroughly transparent and without government ties.

"Conditions for prisoners in solitary confinement in California are an affront to human rights and must end," Thenjiwe McHarris of Amnesty said in a statement. "No human being should be held under the deplorable conditions we have witnessed in California prisons for prolonged periods, even decades."

DEATH WAS 'ABSOLUTELY PREVENTABLE'

Isaac Ontiveros, a spokesman for the inmate support coalition, said Sell had been in solitary for five years, adding that the United Nations "counts any day after 15 days (of isolation) as cruel and unusual punishment."

"His death was absolutely preventable," he said.

Corrections department spokeswoman Deborah Hoffman countered that inmate advocates "are shamelessly exploiting a man's death to mislead the public about a hunger strike orchestrated by violent gang members."

More than 30,000 inmates from some two dozen California prisons began refusing food on July 8 to protest what they regard as cruel and unfair use of solitary confinement as punishment within the system. By Tuesday, the number of inmates participating in the strike had dwindled to 525 in eight prisons, corrections officials say.

Strikers' principal demand has been to end a policy of keeping thousands of inmates in near or total isolation for years on end solely on the basis of alleged gang affiliations. They say the only way out of solitary confinement for many inmates is to become a gang informant, a choice that would be tantamount to signing their own death warrant.

On Tuesday in Sacramento, the state capital, about 50 mothers, wives and other relatives of inmates presented Governor Jerry Brown's office with a petition bearing 41,000 signatures calling for reform of solitary confinement practices.

"We're hoping the governor realizes the support that's being gained to end these types of conditions," Dolores Canales said before leading a march to Brown's office. She said her 37-year-old son has been in solitary confinement in Pelican Bay State Prison for 13 years because of his alleged gang ties.

Corrections officials say nearly 3,600 inmates, or 3 percent of the state's prison population, are held in security housing units, most of them for ties to gangs, others for committing crimes while in prison.

The protest comes at a challenging time for the state prison system, which houses roughly 132,800 inmates and has been ordered by a federal court to reduce its population by 10,000 prisoners this year to ease crowding.

The state has begun housing many low-level offenders in county jails. Medical care in the prisons has been placed under the supervision of a court-appointed federal receiver, and mental healthcare is being watched by a special master.

headline: Michigan attorney general sees no conflict in defending Detroit retirees
byline: By Nick Carey
8:31am EDT

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette says he sees no conflict in representing the state's governor, who approved Detroit's bankruptcy filing, while at the same time representing Detroit's retirees, who assert that the filing is illegal.

In both cases, Schuette said, he is defending Michigan's constitution. He also pointed out that his office is often called upon to appear on conflicting sides of the same case.

they're meant to be followed, and I do that consistently."

Earlier this month, Schuette defended Republican Governor Rick Snyder in three state court cases challenging the governor's power to approve a bankruptcy filing for Michigan's largest city by Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr.

Detroit retirees, workers and the pension funds that filed the cases argue that the law empowering Snyder to approve the bankruptcy filing is unconstitutional because the bankruptcy threatens pension benefits, which are specifically protected by Michigan's constitution.

"I represented the governor, and he was correct," Schuette said. "Obviously we talk all the time, and we agreed the proper place to resolve these issues is the bankruptcy court."

U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Steven Rhodes on July 24 suspended the lawsuits pending in state court, putting his federal courtroom in control of the case.

Last Saturday, Schuette announced he would defend retirees who risk losing public pensions because of Detroit's bankruptcy filing. Schuette's statement cited Michigan's constitutional prohibition against any diminishment or impairment of pension benefits.

Laura Bartell, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, said the attorney general had adopted the right approach to both of the bankruptcy-related disputes.

"Schuette correctly took the position that the Michigan Constitution does not prevent the bankruptcy filing itself," she said in an email. "He is now saying that now that the city is in bankruptcy, its plan of adjustment may not reduce the pensions under the Michigan Constitution. (There is) no conflict in the two positions."

Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection in federal bankruptcy court on July 18 in the biggest municipal bankruptcy case in U.S. history.

The proceedings in bankruptcy court are expected to be protracted and expensive. The city has some $18.5 billion in long-term debt and liabilities and must battle with tens of thousands of creditors, including Detroit's two pension funds.

Schuette told Reuters he has a separate team of attorneys assigned to each side of the Michigan bankruptcy arguments. Over the past five decades, Schuette said, Michigan attorneys general frequently have appeared on conflicting sides of cases.

'COMMON PRACTICE'

"This is common practice both in Michigan and in other states when issues like this might occur," he said. "From time to time, you establish what is called a 'conflict wall,' where you have a team of attorneys on each side of the wall. We're all professionals here and we have an ethics officer who helps us manage all these issues."

Schuette said he often has to represent the Michigan Public Service Commission on the one hand and rate-paying citizens on the other hand.

Detroit has about 23,000 retired city workers, more than double the current city payroll. The city's debt includes $5.7 billion in liabilities for healthcare and other retiree benefits and a $3.5 billion pension liability.

Schuette said he has an open line of communication with Snyder and that he had let the governor and Emergency Manager Orr know of his intention to represent city retirees in federal bankruptcy court.

"After I made my decision, I talked to the governor about it so there were no surprises," he said. "And Kevyn Orr understood that I need to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities."

Schuette is a conservative former Republican state senator, U.S. congressman and judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals.

While not commenting on his own views of either the state or federal bankruptcy matters, Schuette said Detroit's retirees represent a "human aspect" of the city's federal bankruptcy filing that is often overlooked.

"These are cops and firefighters who worked hard, did their job and, through no fault of their own - and possibly due to pension fund mismanagement, their pensions are in jeopardy," he said. "So there's a human side to this that I think is really important."

The bankruptcy case has marked a new low for Detroit, which rose with the U.S. auto industry in the 20th century but has seen its fortunes decline since its zenith in the 1950s as auto jobs moved away and white residents moved to the suburbs.

The city's population has fallen from its peak of 1.8 million to 700,000 now.



headline: Texas due to execute man who killed truckers
byline: By Karen Brooks
8:31am EDT

Texas was scheduled to execute on Wednesday a man convicted of killing two truck drivers in a fit of road rage after one of the drivers pulled a semi truck in front of his motorcycle on the highway, missing him by inches.

Douglas Feldman, 55, was due to die by lethal injection after 6 p.m. local time at a state prison in Huntsville, Texas.

Feldman was convicted of capital murder in 1999 in the August 1998 shooting deaths of Robert Everett and Nick Velasquez, both 18-wheeler truck drivers who encountered Feldman on a highway north of Dallas, according to an account by the Texas Attorney General's Office.

Feldman's appeals included the argument that his trial lawyers were deficient, a juror was improperly dismissed, and the jury was given improper instruction. All those appeals were denied.

Feldman was riding his motorcycle on a highway in Plano, Texas, when Everett's semi truck cut him off, the report said.

An enraged Feldman fired several shots into the back of the trailer before he reloaded, pulled up next to the truck cab and fired into Everett's window, killing him, the report said.

He checked to make sure Everett, 36, was dead before continuing home, but 45 minutes later and 11 miles down the freeway, Feldman saw another 18-wheeler with its driver, 62-year-old Velasquez, fueling up at a gas station.

Feldman pulled into the station, killed Velasquez with two gunshots to the back, and then drove home, the report said.

Authorities said one week later Feldman shot Antonio Vega three times as he was standing outside a fast-food restaurant. Vega survived and a witness turned in Feldman's license plate number. Feldman's gun matched the weapon used in the shootings of all three men, the report said.

At trial, Feldman testified that the shootings were a result of his anger at Everett for cutting him off and said "he had shot Mr. Velasquez because the man was standing beside an eighteen-wheeler, which caused Feldman to 'explode again in anger'," according to the attorney general's report.

During the punishment phase of his trial, during which several witnesses testified about violent encounters with Feldman, prosecutors presented letters he had written in jail to an ex-girlfriend after his arrest on the capital murder charge.

In the letters, Feldman compared killing people to "hunting game animals," the report said, adding that he also described fantasies about walking through Dallas-area stores and shooting shopkeepers who had angered him, or taking deadly revenge on police for a traffic citation.

"He wanted to kill people who disturbed his quiet and then desecrate their corpses," the report said.

Feldman would be the 21st person executed in the United States so far this year and the 11th in Texas, which has put to death more people than any other state since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976.



headline: Ride-sharing companies may lose 'bandit cab' stigma in California
byline: By Alex Dobuzinskis
8:31am EDT

sharing services offered by moonlighting motorists but frowned on by licensed taxi drivers and some cities as "bandit" cab operations would gain new legitimacy in California under a plan proposed on Tuesday by state regulators.

The draft rules to govern companies that already operate under such names as Lyft, SideCar and Uber, allowing passengers to electronically hail rides through smartphone applications, were unveiled by the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) as taxi drivers continued to lobby against them.

The PUC, based in San Francisco, is set to vote on the guidelines as early as its September 5 meeting.

Taxi drivers registered their disapproval by staging a noisy demonstration against the ride-sharing services on Tuesday, circling San Francisco City Hall in their cabs.

Meanwhile, the head of the cabbies' national trade group, the Taxicab, Limousine and Paratransit Association, slammed the proposal as a blow to local control over traditional taxi-for-hire carriers.

San Francisco-based Lyft, SideCar and Uber, the three most well known of the ride-sharing services, hailed the draft guidelines, saying they already comply with several of the key rules laid out in the document.

Among the proposed regulations are requirements for ride-share operators to obtain a license with the PUC to do business in California, to submit their drivers to criminal background checks and to carry liability insurance of at least $1 million per incident.

The PUC's move to regulate commercial ride-sharing in the nation's most populous state comes as a number of major U.S. cities have imposed restrictions on such services.

Lyft, SideCar and Uber, operating in large urban areas across the country and catering to young, tech-savvy passengers, are built around smartphone apps that allow users to call for a ride from drivers who are behind the wheel of their own personal cars and participating in the service.

The apps, which are based on global positioning satellite technology, measure distance traveled and suggest a dollar figure for the rider to pay the driver.

In the case of Lyft, drivers are identified by a fluffy pink mustache they affix to the grill of their cars. Uber differs from Lyft and SideCar because it connects passengers with licensed limousine drivers. But in April, it unveiled another service called UberX that relies on average citizen drivers.

"Ultimately, we hope that other states will see this as an example, and we'll have consistent rules across the country," said Sunil Paul, CEO of SideCar.

Los Angeles launched an aggressive action against Uber, Lyft and SideCar in June when municipal officials issued cease-and-desist letters to the companies, accusing them of operating in the nation's second-largest city without a license.

The companies have continued to do business in Los Angeles in defiance of city officials, insisting they should be governed by the state, which regulates limousines and other ride-for-hire services that operate as private charter carriers in which transportation is arranged in advance.

Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz has been working on city rules to rein in ride-sharing companies and their drivers, which he called "bandit cabs."

"When the first serial rapist appears to be a Lyft driver, I think the city, by doing nothing, is just as liable as anybody else," Koretz said last week.

sharing services offered by moonlighting motorists but frowned on by licensed taxi drivers and some cities as "bandit" cab operations would gain new legitimacy in California under a plan proposed on Tuesday by state regulators.

The draft rules to govern companies that already operate under such names as Lyft, SideCar and Uber, allowing passengers to electronically hail rides through smartphone applications, were unveiled by the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) as taxi drivers continued to lobby against them.

The PUC, based in San Francisco, is set to vote on the guidelines as early as its September 5 meeting.

Taxi drivers registered their disapproval by staging a noisy demonstration against the ride-sharing services on Tuesday, circling San Francisco City Hall in their cabs.

Meanwhile, the head of the cabbies' national trade group, the Taxicab, Limousine and Paratransit Association, slammed the proposal as a blow to local control over traditional taxi-for-hire carriers.

San Francisco-based Lyft, SideCar and Uber, the three most well known of the ride-sharing services, hailed the draft guidelines, saying they already comply with several of the key rules laid out in the document.

Among the proposed regulations are requirements for ride-share operators to obtain a license with the PUC to do business in California, to submit their drivers to criminal background checks and to carry liability insurance of at least $1 million per incident.

The PUC's move to regulate commercial ride-sharing in the nation's most populous state comes as a number of major U.S. cities have imposed restrictions on such services.

Lyft, SideCar and Uber, operating in large urban areas across the country and catering to young, tech-savvy passengers, are built around smartphone apps that allow users to call for a ride from drivers who are behind the wheel of their own personal cars and participating in the service.

The apps, which are based on global positioning satellite technology, measure distance traveled and suggest a dollar figure for the rider to pay the driver.

In the case of Lyft, drivers are identified by a fluffy pink mustache they affix to the grill of their cars. Uber differs from Lyft and SideCar because it connects passengers with licensed limousine drivers. But in April, it unveiled another service called UberX that relies on average citizen drivers.

"Ultimately, we hope that other states will see this as an example, and we'll have consistent rules across the country," said Sunil Paul, CEO of SideCar.

Los Angeles launched an aggressive action against Uber, Lyft and SideCar in June when municipal officials issued cease-and-desist letters to the companies, accusing them of operating in the nation's second-largest city without a license.

The companies have continued to do business in Los Angeles in defiance of city officials, insisting they should be governed by the state, which regulates limousines and other ride-for-hire services that operate as private charter carriers in which transportation is arranged in advance.

Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz has been working on city rules to rein in ride-sharing companies and their drivers, which he called "bandit cabs."

"When the first serial rapist appears to be a Lyft driver, I think the city, by doing nothing, is just as liable as anybody else," Koretz said last week.



headline: San Diego sues its own mayor in sex harassment case
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

The city of San Diego sued its embattled mayor on Tuesday, seeking to recover from him any damages it might face in a lawsuit filed by his former press secretary, one of eight women to publicly accuse him of unwanted sexual advances.

The legal action against Mayor Bob Filner, approved by a unanimous vote of the city council earlier in the day, marked the latest blow against the 70-year-old Democrat as he faces mounting pressure to step down.

Despite calls from across the city and from powerful members of his own party to resign, Filner, a former congressman elected mayor just last year, has said that he would instead stay in office while undergoing two weeks of behavioral therapy starting August 5.

Filner's former communications director, Irene McCormack Jackson, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the mayor and the city on July 22, alleging he asked her to work without panties, demanded kisses, told her he wanted to see her naked and held her in a head lock while whispering in her ear.

Since then, seven other women, including a retired U.S. Navy admiral and a college dean, have publicly accused Filner of groping and other inappropriate behavior.

The latest individual to come forward, Lisa Curtin, said in an interview aired on Tuesday by San Diego station KPBS that Filner suggested during a private meeting that they date one another, stroked the wedding band on her finger and reached over to kiss her.

"I turned my head at that moment and on the side of my face, I got a very wet, saliva-filled kiss including feeling his tongue on my cheek," she told the station.

The city filed its lawsuit as a cross-complaint to Jackson's, seeking to recover from Filner any damages it might be ordered to pay, along with court costs and attorneys fees.

"If Bob Filner engaged in unlawful conduct and the city is held liable, he will have to reimburse us every penny the city pays and its attorney fees," City Attorney Jan Goldsmith, who had clashed with the mayor before the scandal emerged this month, said in a written statement.

Seven of nine members of the City Council, including Council President Todd Gloria who is a Democrat, have called on Filner to resign; two recall campaigns have been launched against him.

A spokeswoman for the mayor could not be reached for comment on Tuesday afternoon.

LEGAL, POLITICAL FIGHT

Hours after the city's lawsuit was filed, council members voted unanimously to deny a request from Filner's private attorney, Harvey Berger, to authorize the city to assume the mayor's legal defense costs in the case. City attorney Goldsmith already has declined to defend the mayor.

"The mayor has no right to expect a blank check from San Diego taxpayers to cover for his bad acts," Gloria said after the vote.

University of California, San Diego, political science professor Steven Erie said that it was rare for a city to refuse to pay for the legal defense of a municipal official in a sexual harassment lawsuit.

"It tells you just how bad mayor-council relationships have become" in San Diego, Erie said.

In the face of opposition from the City Council, Filner could establish a legal defense fund and raise donations to pay for his own attorney, Erie said, though he added: "The question is how much and how many and whether they want their names to be made public."

On Sunday, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California became the latest prominent Democrat to call for Filner's resignation during an interview on CNN. U.S. Representatives Susan Davis and Scott Peters, whose districts include parts of San Diego, previously called for him to step down.

Last week U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Filner should seek private counseling and compared his behavior to the conduct of another ex-congressman engulfed in a sex scandal since he turned to mayoral politics, Democrat Anthony Weiner of New York.

Weiner faces calls to withdraw from the New York City mayor's race after admitting he sent lewd online messages to women since he resigned from Capitol Hill over such behavior two years ago.



headline: 'Obamacare' mandate delay will cost $12 billion, affect 1 million workers
byline: By David Morgan
8:31am EDT

sponsored health insurance in 2014, congressional researchers said Tuesday.

The report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office is the first authoritative estimate of the human and fiscal cost from the administration's unexpected one-year delay announced July 2 of the employer mandate - a requirement for larger businesses to provide health coverage for their workers or pay a penalty.

The analysts said the delay will add to the cost of "Obamacare's" insurance-coverage provisions over the next 10 years. Penalties paid by employers would be lower and more individuals who otherwise might have had employer coverage will need federal insurance subsidies.

"Of those who would otherwise have obtained employment-based coverage, roughly half will be uninsured (in 2014)," CBO said in a July 30 letter to Representative Paul Ryan, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Budget Committee.

Under Obama's healthcare reform law, employers with 50 or more full-time workers were supposed to provide healthcare coverage or incur penalties beginning January 1. But the requirement will now begin in 2015.

The delay intensified doubts about the administration's ability to implement Obama's signature domestic policy achievement and stirred Republican calls for a similar delay in another Obamacare mandate that requires most individuals to have health insurance in 2014.

The Republican-controlled House followed up the administration's decision by voting on July 17 for its own measures to delay the employer and individual mandates. Neither piece of legislation is expected to succeed in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

State and federal officials are racing to set up new online health insurance exchanges, where lower-to-moderate income families that lack health insurance will be able to sign up for federally subsidized coverage beginning on October 1. The poor will also be able to sign up for Medicaid coverage in 23 states that have opted to expand the program.

Most large employers already offer health insurance and CBO said few are expected to drop coverage because of the delay.

But the change will still result in a $10 billion reduction in penalty payments that some employers would have made in 2015 for failing to provide coverage next year, CBO said.

The change also means another $3 billion in added costs for exchange subsidies. That is because about half of the 1 million workers who would have gained employer-sponsored coverage next year will now obtain insurance through the exchanges or via public programs including Medicaid, CBO said.

Other changes, including an increase in taxable compensation resulting from fewer people enrolling in employment-based coverage, will offset those factors by about $1 billion.

CBO now puts the net cost of Obamacare's insurance coverage provisions at around $1.38 trillion over the next 10 years, vs. its May baseline projection of $1.36 trillion.



headline: MIT review cites missed chances before death of Net activist
byline: By Ross Kerber
8:31am EDT

Reviewers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said on Tuesday the school could have taken steps that would have reduced pressure on Internet activist Aaron Swartz such as taking a public stand against his controversial prosecution.

Swartz, 26, killed himself in January, two years after he was arrested and later charged by the U.S. Justice Department for hacking into MIT's network to download millions of academic articles, potentially to make them freely available to the public.

Swartz's death became a flashpoint in a broader debate over how far prosecutors should go in enforcing U.S. computer rules, and raised questions over whether MIT, a traditional leader in technology matters should have spoken up in his defense.

An internal MIT review found that while leaders of the elite school may have been trying to act with restraint, they paid little attention to Swartz's case as it was developing and did not question the law underlying the charges.

"MIT's position may have been prudent, but it did not duly take into account the wider background of information policy against which the prosecution played out and in which MIT people have traditionally been passionate leaders," according to the report. The reviewers also wrote that "...by responding as we did, MIT missed an opportunity to demonstrate the leadership that we pride ourselves on."

After Swartz' death, his partner Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman criticized what she described as MIT's "indifference" to the matter.

In a statement on Tuesday from her Twitter handle, @TarenSK, she called the new MIT report "a whitewash" and wrote that MIT should have come out publicly against the case.

According to MIT's report, MIT employees first learned of someone using its network improperly starting in the fall of 2010 and did not learn it was Swartz until he was arrested the following January.

At the time Swartz was already known for technical work like developing a content-reading format and advocating to make more information publicly available.

U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz's office used a 29-year-old computer security law to charge Swartz with 13 felony counts that carried maximum prison time of 35 years, even though he had not profited from his actions.

MIT President Rafael Reif launched a review of the case shortly after Swartz's death. Speaking on a conference call with journalists on Tuesday Reif acknowledged the school could have acted differently.

On the conference call, review leader and MIT Computer Science Professor Hal Abelson said he hoped the school could use Swartz's case to teach students about the tensions posed by Internet technologies that can be used both for good or bad.

"Aaron Swartz did both," he said. In a later interview by phone Abelson said that in his own view, MIT should have taken a stronger role on issues surrounding the case such as the merits of the computer security law and what might have been more appropriate punishments for Swartz.

"At least my opinion is that MIT should have been more engaged in the wider picture around this," Abelson said.



headline: Small Kentucky liberal arts college gets $250 million donation

8:31am EDT

Centre College, a tiny school in Kentucky that has hosted vice presidential election debates, announced on Tuesday a $250 million donation from a computer company founder's family foundation, which the college said was the largest ever to a liberal arts institution.

The gift from the A. Eugene Brockman Charitable Trust, named after the founder of Universal Computer Systems Inc, will fund 40 new Brockman Scholarships annually beginning next year, said the school, which expects an enrollment of 1,375 students this autumn.

"You could have knocked me over with a feather," said Richard Trollinger, vice president for college relations at Centre College, of the moment he was told the size of the gift.

It is the largest gift to a liberal arts college in the history of U.S. higher education, and among the largest gifts ever given to any college or university of any type, he said.

The Brockman Trust said in a statement that it chose Centre College in part because the current chairman of the company, Bob Brockman, went to college there and the experience made a "tremendous impact" on him.

The gift is in stock in Universal Computer Systems Holding Inc., a provider of inventory management systems for the auto industry, which merged with Reynolds and Reynolds Co. in 2006.

Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, was founded by Presbyterians in 1819. Since 1967, the church has not financially supported the school, but there remains a close bond, according to Trollinger.

The college hosted the vice presidential debates in 2000 and 2012.



headline: Florida, Georgia say insurance rates to spike under Obamacare
byline: By Caroline Humer
8:31am EDT

Florida and Georgia, two states where politicians oppose U.S. President Barack Obama's healthcare law, said on Tuesday that insurance rates for individuals would rise sharply in 2014 under the reform.

The remarks are part of an increasingly polarized debate over whether "Obamacare" will prove affordable for millions of uninsured Americans when new health plans become available on state-based exchanges as of October 1.

Several states that have embraced the healthcare reform have shown residents how the law will reduce insurance costs, while those that have opposed its implementation are beginning to present it as a more expensive prospect for consumers.

The figures released do not factor in substantial government subsidies that will be available to many consumers based on household income, which will offset their actual out-of-pocket expenses. The government is planning for 7 million people to sign up for the new health plans that take effect in 2014.

Georgia said that insurance premiums for a 25-year-old male currently in a high-deductible plan would rise up to 198 percent in 2014 and rates for many others could rise by 20 percent to 100 percent. Georgia asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to delay a Wednesday deadline for a final rate submission from the state.

The department said it was working with the all states to meet deadlines and reviewing Georgia's request.

Florida's office of insurance regulation said on Tuesday that rates for individuals will rise roughly 30 to 40 percent next year. Florida compared a 2014 mid-tier silver plan with a fictional 2013 plan that was created to cover the same 70 percent of the health care expenses that a silver plan will. Current plans may cost less than the fictional plan, but they also provide fewer benefits.

"If you take a straight average you get a distortion because you don't have the same benefits," Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty said.

Indiana's department of insurance last week said that insurance costs to individuals under the Affordable Care Act would rise 72 percent. Unlike other states disclosing insurance plan prices, Indiana factored in not only premium rates, but also the costs of other insurance components like co-pays and prescriptions.

"These announcements from states have almost been a Rorschach test of how they view Obamacare," said Larry Levitt, vice president of special projects for the Kaiser Family Foundation.

"Consumers are hearing a welcoming message from states that are participating in implementing the law ... and that could absolutely have an effect on how many people enroll," he said. "The reverse is also true" for states that are warning consumers that prices will be high, he said.

California, one of the states that has most enthusiastically prepared for Obamacare, kicked off the debate in May when it said costs for products for individuals would fall for a 40-year-old nonsmoker by up to 29 percent compared to similar products. New York said earlier this month that average rates would drop by more than 50 percent.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services earlier this month said in 11 states that it studied were 18 percent lower than expectations, based on Congressional Budget Office Estimates, and that this would likely be the case nationally.

"We are confident that Florida's premiums will be affordable, and that consumers will have multiple options in a competitive and transparent marketplace," a senior administration official said in response to a Reuters query about the rate comments. "Without releasing the premiums, the statistics released today don't provide consumers with any information on what they will actually pay in the marketplace."



headline: Florida pain doctors convicted of money laundering
byline: By Zachary Fagenson
8:31am EDT

A jury acquitted two South Florida doctors of causing the deaths of patients who overdosed on pain medication, but convicted them of money laundering for their role in a conspiracy involving a chain of pain clinics.

The two doctors, Cynthia Cadet, 43, a retired U.S. Air Force major, and Joseph Castronuovo, 74, faced life in prison and fines up to $2 million each for their role at the clinics. Seven of Cadet's patients and two of Castronuovo's patients died of drug overdoses.

The doctors could still face up to 10 years in jail for the money laundering charges as well as forfeiture of the money made while working at the clinics, $1.2 million in Cadet's case and $164,000 in Castronuovo's case.

The jury took 20 hours to reach their verdict on Tuesday. It capped a four-year operation targeting a string of South Florida pain clinics nicknamed "Oxy Alley" that resulted in racketeering charges against 32 people in 2010.

Defense lawyers argued both doctors were unaware of the conspiracy and were practicing medicine in line with state prescribed standards, which allows licensed physicians to distribute opioid pain pills without fear of punishment.

"There was not a single piece of evidence at this trial that showed she knew of any conspiracy," said Michael D. Weinstein, Cadet's attorney.

"It's an inconsistent verdict when you're saying to the judge, we're finding her not guilty, yet on the proceeds of the conspiracy, she's guilty of that."

Weinstein said the government case was flawed because Florida didn't have any laws in place or any prescription pill monitoring program at the time of the alleged conspiracy.

Prosecutors accused Cadet and Castronuovo of being "drug dealers in white coats" who abandoned their medical ethics. Addicts and distributors traveled in some cases more than 1,000 miles to the South Florida clinics where the two doctors worked. They paid for visits in cash to be prescribed hundreds of pills at a time.

The two operations where the doctors worked disbursed more than 20 million oxycodone tablets between 2008 and 2010, earning about $40 million, according to prosecutors.

The clinic owner, Christopher George, is serving more than 17 years in prison and his brother and co-owner Jeffrey George is serving more than 15. Both testified on the government's behalf.

Florida once had 90 of the top 100 oxycodone-purchasing physicians in the nation and 53 of the top 100 oxycodone-purchasing pharmacies.

The state claims to have made enormous strides in recent years against a nationwide epidemic of prescription drug abuse.



headline: California city becomes first to adopt eminent domain plan
byline: By Tim Reid and Jim Christie
8:31am EDT

The city of Richmond, California, said on Tuesday it will use its power of eminent domain, if necessary, to seize "underwater" mortgage loans to keep its residents in their homes, becoming the first U.S. municipality to adopt such an approach.

The northern California city, long plagued by poverty and crime, sent notice to the holders of more than 620 underwater home mortgages in the city, asking them to sell the loans to the city. It would buy the mortgages for 80 percent of the fair value of the homes, write them down and help the homeowners refinance their mortgages.

In the event the owners of the loans would not cooperate, the city would seize the loans using eminent domain, Mayor Gayle McLaughlin said.

A mortgage is underwater if its unpaid balance is greater than the fair market value of the home.

Richmond, where nearly half of its homeowners are underwater, plans further such actions in the future, officials said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday.

"Residents here in Richmond have been suffering for years thanks to the housing crisis Wall Street created and which Wall Street refuses to fix," said McLaughlin in a statement.

Numerous groups, including the National Association of Realtors, the American Bankers Association, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, have already voiced fierce opposition to using the threat of eminent domain to buy mortgages.

"It is very, very discouraging to see a municipality begin the process," Timothy Cameron, managing director and head of SIFMA's Asset Management Group, said in an interview. "What this does is destroys the contractual rights of investors along with their trust and confidence in the capital markets. I wouldn't be surprised if a lawsuit is filed by investors, quite frankly."

Eminent domain is normally used by cities to force the sale of homes if they obstruct the construction of a project deemed beneficial to the wider community, such as a road or bridge.

Using eminent domain to force banks and other investors to sell mortgages is a novel use of the legal doctrine, and one with little legal precedent.

Richmond is working with San Francisco-based Mortgage Resolution Partners, a private investment firm that has been pitching the plan to U.S. cities and municipalities for more than a year. MRP, raising money from private sources, would work with the city to obtain the financing to buy the distressed mortgages and restructure them. MRP would receive a fee for every troubled loan it restructured under the plan.

Bill Falik of MRP said mortgages are a form of property that can be seized by Richmond, whose housing market is languishing while other home markets in the San Francisco Bay area are rebounding.

"There are some communities coming out of this crisis," Falik said. "Richmond hasn't."

Kevin Whelan of the Home Defenders League, a group that is also working with Richmond on the plan, says other U.S. cities, including Newark, New Jersey, Seattle and Nevada's North Las Vegas, are watching Richmond's effort closely.

"Cities and communities all across the country have been looking for solutions for deeply distressed and underwater loans for some time," Whelan said.

Five years after the 2008 financial crisis, which was triggered by a collapse of the housing market, one in five U.S. mortgages is still underwater.

Out of 50 million U.S. homeowners, 10.2 million are still underwater, according to the National Association of Realtors.

In California alone, 2 million homeowners are underwater. Another 500,000 are delinquent on their mortgage payments, according to figures from ForeclosureRadar.com.

McLaughlin said Richmond expects responses to its letters no later than August 13 and that the Richmond city council will by September be in a position to begin with its program.

Doris Ducre said she hopes the program will help her reduce the principal on her home loan. She estimated the value of her four-bedroom home at $170,000 - well below the $300,000 it cost her.

"Any type of principal reduction would be great for me," said Ducre, who has 15 years to go on her 30 year mortgage.

Three young children were injured on Tuesday, including two trapped under a car, after the vehicle slammed into a child care center in Kansas City, Missouri, according to local officials.

The children suffered "mild to moderate injuries that are not life-threatening," said a spokeswoman for Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City. Earlier, officials had said they were seriously injured.

Kansas City Police Captain Tye Grant said in an email that a Range Rover had rear-ended a parked Cadillac, forcing the Cadillac through the front wall of the center. The center had been occupied by about 40 children.

"All the children (at the day care) have been accounted for at this point," a police statement said.

The driver of the Range Rover, an elderly man, was hospitalized, Grant said, adding that police were still considering whether to file charges against him.



headline: WikiLeaks' Assange condemns Manning verdict, Obama
byline: By Andrew Osborn
8:31am EDT

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange accused President Barack Obama of "national security extremism" on Tuesday after an American military judge convicted Bradley Manning over the biggest leak of classified documents in U.S. history.

Praising Manning as "the most important journalistic source that the world has ever seen", Assange said the U.S. soldier, who prosecutors said had supplied WikiLeaks with hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents, did not receive a fair trial and called for the verdict to be overturned.

"The government kept Bradley Manning in a cage, stripped him naked and isolated him in order to break him, an act formally condemned by the United Nations Special Rapporteur for torture. This was never a fair trial," Assange said from inside the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, his home for more than a year.

Assange said WikiLeaks and Manning's own legal team would not rest until the judgment was overturned.

"It is a dangerous precedent and an example of national security extremism. It is a short-sighted judgment that cannot be tolerated and it must be reversed."

Assange did not confirm or deny whether Manning had in fact supplied WikiLeaks with classified documents, always using the word "alleged" when talking about the leak. WikiLeaks did not reveal its sources, he said, and always protected them.

Manning's conviction on five espionage and 14 other charges poses a potential problem for Assange since the severity of the judgment, which carries a jail sentence of up to 136 years, might deter would-be whistleblowers, the lifeblood of Assange's organization.

It is also a reminder of his own fate. Wanted in Sweden on sexual abuse allegations he denies, Assange has sought sanctuary in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London because he fears he would be extradited to the United States to face trial over his own alleged role in the leak case if he agreed to go to Sweden.

Manning's is one of two high-profile leak cases involving Americans. Former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden has been holed up at a Moscow airport for more than a month, despite U.S. calls for Russian authorities to turn him over.

Dressed in a dark suit, Assange said Obama had initiated more espionage proceedings cases against whistleblowers and publishers than all previous U.S. presidents combined and had made a mockery of his own words in the process.

"In 2008, the then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran on a platform that praised whistleblowing as an act of courage and patriotism. That platform has by Barack Obama's actions been comprehensively betrayed," said Assange.

Assange had nothing but praise for Manning, holding up his behavior as a model of how to be a whistleblower.

"His actions as alleged are unquestionably heroic. He in that sense is an example for others to follow."

headline: Ex-Penn State officials ordered to trial in sex abuse case
byline: By Dave Warner
8:31am EDT

Penn State's former president and two other top administrators were ordered to stand trial on Tuesday on charges they covered up the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal.

Harrisburg District Judge William Wenner, after a two-day preliminary hearing, ordered a criminal trial to be held for the university's former president, Graham Spanier, 65, its former athletic director, Tim Curley, 59, and its former senior vice president, Gary Schultz, 63.

Sandusky, 69, a former assistant football coach, was convicted in June 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse involving 10 boys. He is serving a sentence of 30 to 60 years in a state prison.

"The magistrate has made his decision, we respect that decision, even if we disagree with it," said Spanier's defense lawyer Timothy Lewis.

No trial date has been set and lawyers for the three have filed a motion to have the charges against their clients annulled.

Prosecutors used Spanier's previously secret grand jury testimony during the two-day preliminary hearing before Judge Wenner.

Spanier told a 2011 grand jury he had no knowledge of a 1998 allegation that Sandusky had showered with an 11-year-old boy in the locker room. Nor did he know whether Curley or Schultz knew of the incident.

But those statements run counter to 1998 emails that were also introduced as evidence during the hearing before Wenner. Those emails show the trio discussed the shower incident and that the late football coach Joe Paterno was also aware of the incident.

The 1998 incident preceded another report of Sandusky abusing a child in the showers in 2001. The 2001 incident was described in detail on Monday by former assistant football coach, Mike McQueary.

He also testified that he told Paterno and Curley and Schultz about seeing Sandusky and a boy engage in a sex act in the locker room shower. But no one told police.

Spanier, Curley, and Schultz are accused of a "conspiracy of silence" for failing to report the shower incident to authorities, which permitted Sandusky to continue preying on boys. He met most of his victims through a charity he founded for at-risk youth.

Sandusky was arrested in November 2011 and charged with molesting boys. A year later, in November 2012, a grand jury charged Spanier, Curley and Schultz with endangering the welfare of children, criminal conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Spanier also was charged with perjury.

Curley and Schultz were previously charged in November 2011 with perjury and failure to report suspected abuse.

Within weeks of Sandusky's arrest, Penn State Trustees fired Spanier, at the time the nation's highest-paid public university president. Trustees also fired Paterno, Sandusky's boss. Months later, Paterno, a legendary figure in college football died of lung cancer at the age of 85.

Curley was placed on administrative leave and Schultz had already retired from the school.

Civil lawsuits filed by the victims, now grown men, against the university are close to being settled, with the school putting aside $60 million to cover the claims, according to a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs. The attorney said there were as many as 32 claims from alleged victims.

Spanier's lawyers said they intend to file defamation charges against Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Freeh was the author of a study, commissioned by the university, laying out a narrative of the scandal that many in the state rejected, including the Paterno family.

The Freeh report prompted the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing body for college sports, fine Penn State $60 million and void the 14 seasons of football victories Sandusky coached.

Three young children were seriously injured on Tuesday, including two trapped under a car, after the vehicle slammed into a child care center in Kansas City, Missouri, according to local officials.

The children suffered "serious but not life-threatening injuries," and were taken to Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, according to Danny Rotert, Kansas City communications director, who was interviewed on CNN.

One adult was also taken to an area hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Kansas City Police Captain Tye Grant said in an email that a Range Rover had rear-ended a Cadillac, forcing the Cadillac through the front wall of the center. The center had been occupied by about 40 children.

"All the children (at the day care) have been accounted for at this point," said Rotert.

The driver of the Range Rover was hospitalized.

A representative for Children's Mercy Hospital was not immediately available for comment.

that the agency's regulations disrupt the economy and cost jobs.

The benefits derived from rules to address climate change and protect the environment far outweigh their costs, said McCarthy, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 18 as EPA administrator.

"Can we stop talking about environmental regulations killing jobs, please?" McCarthy said in a speech at Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The EPA, often a lightning rod for Republican opposition in Congress, is working to develop "a new mindset about how climate change and environmental protection fits within our national and global economic agenda," McCarthy said.

Embracing the need to cut carbon emissions should be seen not as a threat but as a "way to spark business innovation," she said.

The federal Clean Air Act, the basis of the EPA's powers to set rules, has produced $30 in benefits for every dollar spent in its name, she added.

McCarthy was confirmed after a months-long process that at one point involved a Republican boycott of a committee vote and required her to answer more than 1,000 questions posted by senators about the EPA's rulemaking processes and transparency.

The speech, just a few miles from her hometown of Boston, marked the start of a nationwide tour to talk about why acting on climate change is necessary and to dispel common criticisms.

McCarthy, along with Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, is making public appearances to help President Barack Obama roll out the Climate Action Plan he announced in June.

At the heart of Obama's plan will be new EPA regulations that will target carbon emissions from existing power plants, which account for more than one-third of U.S. greenhouse gases and in many cases are fired by coal.

McCarthy said the agency will try to replicate the success it had with the U.S. automotive industry, with which it collaborated to craft new fuel efficiency standards.

"This is a game plan for other sectors to follow on how we can reduce emissions, strengthen energy security and develop new economic benefits for consumers and businesses," McCarthy said.

In addition to close collaboration with industry, McCarthy said she will look to states and local governments that have piloted emission reduction policies and blueprints without waiting for Washington. She said the EPA would not be a leader, but a follower of states' programs to curb emissions, relying on the work they've already put into force.

'HONEST COMMENTER' ON KEYSTONE

McCarthy also addressed one of the most controversial environmental and energy issues facing the Obama administration - the proposed Keystone Pipeline project.

Responding to a question about the climate impact of the 830,000 barrel per day pipeline, McCarthy first jokingly pretended to walk away from the podium before responding.

"In all seriousness, I think the best that EPA can do is to be an honest commenter on the environmental impact statement, which we've done our best to do and which we'll continue to do," she said.

An assessment of the project by the EPA released in March raised concerns about the analysis done by the State Department, which found there would be no significant effect on greenhouse gas emissions.

McCarthy said the Obama administration was examining all aspects of the pipeline proposal.

"It is not supposed to be easy," she said. "It is supposed to be hard, it is supposed to be all interests coming together and screaming at the top of their lungs like three crazy children."



headline: Real Housewives of New Jersey stars appear on federal fraud charges

Two stars of "The Real Housewives of New Jersey" were released on $500,000 bond each on Tuesday after appearing in federal court on fraud and tax evasion charges that could get one of them kicked out of the United States.

Teresa Giudice, 41, and her husband Giuseppe "Joe" Giudice, 43, held hands during their appearance on a 39-count indictment at the hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Cathy Waldor.

The judge asked if they understood the charges against them and whether they realized that, if convicted, Guiseppe faces potential deportation back to Italy because he is not a U.S. citizen.

"Yes," answered Teresa Giudice, wearing a white pant suit, her typically puffy black hairdo tamed into a ponytail.

"Yes," said her husband, his tattoos covered by a dark suit with a pink shirt and peach and blue striped tie.

Prosecutors outlined a bevy of charges against the couple who star in the fifth season of the New Jersey version of the "Real Housewives" reality TV series on Bravo Media.

They are accused of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, making false statements on loan applications and hiding income in a bankruptcy case.

From September 2001 until 2008, the Giudices submitted fraudulent loan applications to obtain mortgages and other loans, according to the indictment. After filing for bankruptcy protection in 2009, prosecutors charge the couple concealed businesses they owned, income from their rental property, as well as income that Teresa received from the reality show.

Giuseppe also was charged with failing to file tax returns for 2004-2008, when he received more than $996,000 in income.

U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, speaking outside the courthouse, called the charges against the Giudices serious.

"The victims first are the United States, because the United States first of all was denied the income taxes that the Giudices should have paid, the banks that gave out the loans that they shouldn't have given out, and of course the bankruptcy court," Fishman said.

The Guidices' lawyers said their clients were innocent of the charges.

"There is another side here that you haven't heard, but you'll hear in the courtroom, and we're going to prepare accordingly," said attorney Miles Feinstein, who represents Giuseppe.

Their arraignment was scheduled for August 14 before U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas.

headline: Student jailed without food, water reaches $4.1 million settlement with U.S. government

8:31am EDT

A California university student who was left handcuffed in a federal holding cell for nearly 5 days without food or water has reached a $4.1 million settlement with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), his lawyers said on Tuesday.

Daniel Chong, who was rounded up along with eight other people in an April 21, 2012, drug raid at a San Diego area home, has said that he was forced to drink his own urine and nearly died after being placed in the cell and apparently forgotten.

After the ordeal, the 24-year-old student of the University of California, San Diego, spent five days in a San Diego hospital, three of them in intensive care. Last year, he filed a $20 million claim, a precursor to a lawsuit, against the DEA.

On Tuesday, his attorneys, Eugene Iredale and Julia Yoo, said they had settled that claim with the DEA for $4.1 million.

"To its credit, the government has responded by acknowledging responsibility, apologizing personally to Daniel and instituting changes in policies regarding safety checks for prisoners in temporary holding cells at DEA facilities," Iredale said. "What happened to Daniel Chong should never happen to any human being on the face of the planet."

A spokeswoman for the DEA said the agency was investigating the incident but referred calls regarding the settlement to the Department of Justice. A spokesman there could not immediately be reached for comment.

The DEA previously acknowledged that Chong had been accidentally left in a holding cell, and the head of the DEA's San Diego office said in a statement that he was "deeply troubled" by the incident.

Chong's lawyers have said that he was arrested at the home of friend during a raid by a drug enforcement task force investigating an ecstasy trafficking ring that included DEA agents, sheriff's deputies and San Diego police officers.

Iredale said that once authorities determined Chong was not part of the ring, a San Diego police officer put him in the 5-foot by 10-foot cell with his hands cuffed behind his back, telling him, "We'll come to get you in a minute."

Instead, Chong remained in the cell for four and a half days and by the time he was found he was suffering from severe dehydration, muscle deterioration, hallucinations, liver and kidney failure and extremely high levels of sodium, according to his attorneys. He lost 15 pounds during the ordeal.

The DEA said in a statement issued at the time that agents detained nine people including Chong during the raid and seized some 18,000 ecstasy pills, marijuana, hallucinogenic mushrooms and prescription medicines, firearms and ammunition.



headline: Manning acquitted of aiding enemy, still may face long jail term
byline: By Medina Roshan and Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

A military judge on Tuesday found U.S. soldier Bradley Manning not guilty of aiding the enemy, the most serious charge he faced for handing over documents to WikiLeaks, but he still likely faces a long jail term after being found guilty of 19 other counts.

Colonel Denise Lind ruled the 25-year-old Army private first class was guilty of five espionage charges, among many others, for the largest unauthorized release of classified U.S. data in the nation's history.

The trove of documents, including battlefield videos and diplomatic cables, was a huge boost to the profile of the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website and its founder Julian Assange. Tuesday's verdict could be a blow to his efforts to encourage people with access to secret information to release it publicly.

Supporters of Manning called the verdict overreaching.

"It is a short-sighted judgment that cannot be tolerated and it must be reversed," Assange told reporters at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he has been living for more than a year. "The abuse of Bradley Manning has left the world with a sense of disgust."

Manning, who was working as a low-level intelligence analyst in Baghdad when he was arrested three years ago, could face up to 136 years in military prison. Lind will take up the question of his sentence on Wednesday.

Wearing his dress uniform, the slightly built Manning showed little reaction during the five-minute hearing.

The U.S. government was pushing for a life sentence without parole, which would have come if Manning had been convicted of aiding the enemy by leaking of information that included battlefield reports from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

It viewed the action as a serious breach of national security, while anti-secrecy activists praised it as shining a light on shadowy U.S. operations abroad.

"The verdict is certainly a chilling one for investigative journalism, for people who might come into information that they believe should be part of the public discourse," said Michael Bochenek, director of law and policy at Amnesty International. "The message is that the government will go after you."

MANNING AND SNOWDEN

Manning's case is one of two prominent ones involving high-profile leaks, illustrating the limits of secrecy in the Internet age. Former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden has been holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport for more than a month, despite U.S. calls for Russian authorities to turn him over.

martial that U.S. security was harmed when WikiLeaks published videos of a 2007 attack by an American Apache helicopter gunship in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff, diplomatic cables and secret details on prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay.

Manning's leaks to the site in 2009 and 2010 put the international spotlight on Assange.

The verdict may embolden the U.S. government to bring a criminal case against Assange, said James Goodale, a lawyer and author with expertise in press freedom.

"The bottom line is they won because the guy leaked illegally, and they're only going to be encouraged to get the guy who's on the other side of that equation," said Goodale, a former lawyer for the New York Times.

Any charges against Assange would likely center on conspiring with Manning to have the young soldier violate the Espionage Act. Any case against Assange would have the additional complication of whether the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees press freedom, would apply to Assange in a way that it did not to Manning.

A crowd of about 30 Manning supporters gathered outside Fort Meade, where the court-martial was held. One of them, Nathan Fuller, expressed concern over the stiff sentence Manning could still face.

"The remaining charges against him are still tantamount to life in prison. That's still an outrage," Fuller said. "He's equated with spies and traitors."

But two top U.S. Congressmen from a House intelligence committee praised the verdict.

"Justice has been served today. PFC Manning harmed our national security, violated the public's trust, and now stands convicted of multiple serious crimes," said Representatives Michael Rogers, a Republican who chairs the committee and Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat and its ranking member.

During the court-martial proceedings, military prosecutors called the defendant a "traitor" for publicly posting information that the U.S. government said could jeopardize national security and intelligence operations.

Defense lawyers described Manning as well-intentioned but naive in hoping that his disclosures would provoke a more intense debate in the United States about diplomatic and military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

speed transmission.

Cherokee production started on June 24, a month later than planned, at Chrysler's assembly facility in Toledo, Ohio. The automaker had planned to begin selling the 2014 Cherokee in August.

Chrysler on Tuesday confirmed it was pushing back the Cherokee launch after postponing a media test drive that was planned for next week.

The Cherokee will be the first vehicle to use the nine-speed automatic transmission, which Chrysler developed with German supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG.

The Cherokee is also the first Jeep vehicle to be built on a Fiat SpA platform. Chrysler is an affiliate of Fiat.

Fiat-Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne downplayed the delay and said Tuesday the company will work over the next several weeks to ensure that it's corrected.

"These things go on all the time in any product launches and they go on with a certain degree of frequency," he said on a conference call with investors and media announcing Chrysler's second-quarter results.

"We keep on tweaking and finalizing the car." The company said the issue revolved around the calibration of the new transmission.

The success of the Cherokee, which replaces the Liberty in Jeep's lineup, is seen as critical to Chrysler's success. Chrysler stopped production of the Liberty last August, and Marchionne said Chrysler was "paying a huge price" for not having a compact SUV on the market.

A smooth introduction of the Cherokee, Marchionne added, is "an absolute necessary condition" for Chrysler to meet its financial targets in the second half.

Chrysler on Tuesday lowered its 2013 profit forecast to a range between $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion from $2.2 billion.

Chrysler has invested $550 million in its Toledo plant to produce the new Cherokee.

The automaker is in the process of ramping up production of the Cherokee. It's adding a second shift of workers, and at full capacity the plant will be able to produce 500 vehicles per nine-hour shift, or about 240,000 Jeeps a year.



headline: Miami gunman downloaded computer files on explosives, sex
byline: By Kevin Gray
8:31am EDT

A gunman who went on a shooting rampage in an apartment building had been forced to resign from his job at a Miami college after authorities found he downloaded files with links to bomb making, counterfeiting and killing with bare hands, according to documents released by the school on Tuesday.

Pedro Alberto Vargas, 42, set his apartment on fire, shot and killed six neighbors, and took 2 others hostage in the worst Miami area shootings in three decades.

A SWAT team stormed his apartment in Hialeah in a pre-dawn raid on Saturday, killing Vargas and rescuing the hostages.

Police continue to investigate a possible motive in the shooting, and neighbors have said they knew little about Vargas, a graphic artist who graduated with an associate's degree from Miami Dade College and worked at the school from 2004 to 2008.

According to a personnel file released by the state college, Vargas resigned in December 2008 from his job in the media services department after he "downloaded or transferred at least twenty-four files, of a personal nature, covering a variety of topics deemed to be inappropriate," one of the documents shows. The files included some of a sexual nature.

"During his full-time tenure, his supervisors became concerned about his performance, including his punctuality, adherence to deadlines, the quality of his work, and the following of orders, among other issues," Juan Mendieta, a college spokesman, said in a statement.

"It was also learned that just prior to his resignation, on one occasion, he visited an anti-government website," Mendieta said, although he did not provide details on the site.

In a letter detailing the allegations, a school official said the files Vargas downloaded included links to topics on letter, fertilizer and mailbox bombs, making plastic explosives from bleach and how to get a new identity.

Other topics included tutorials on hacking, hypnosis, credit card fraud, how to seduce women and "how to kill someone with your bare hands," the college said.

Vargas challenged the accusations in an email sent to school officials and said some of the files were downloaded outside of normal working hours when he was not at work.

"This letter is to make clear that I don't have anything to do with those false allegations," he said, adding that they were intended "to smear my good name and reputation."

Vargas wrote: "I do not have any desire to work under such intoxicating enviro[n]ment that has been created in the department."

He resigned from his job several days later.

The shooting started Friday evening after Vargas set fire to a large amount of cash. His mother told police he had withdrawn $10,000 from his savings account, but the exact amount remains unclear.

Vargas had more than $90,000 in a bank account, according to The Miami Herald, citing records found in the apartment.

Among the victims in the shooting were an elderly couple who were the apartment building's managers and four neighbors, including a 17-year-old girl who police said was shot while trying to hide in a bathtub.

Vargas also fired 10 to 20 shots into the street, killing a man walking home with his 9-year-old son after picking the boy up from boxing practice, police said.

Police are investigating reports that Vargas was possibly involved in a rental dispute, although court records show no eviction process was under way.

double the federal minimum wage.

Protesters, many who earn less than the $11 per hour threshold many economists consider the cutoff for poverty-level wages, said they had nothing to lose by speaking out against their employers.

"Remaining silent is not an option because it's nearly impossible to survive on $7.25 an hour," said Kareem Starks, a McDonald's worker in Brooklyn, referring to the federal minimum wage. Organizers said as many as 500 workers turned out for the New York rallies.

But opponents of the campaign, in their highest profile response to the workers yet, put out a full-page ad in USA Today that said catering to those demands would kill jobs.

The protesting workers, who are getting support from unions, and community and religious groups, are also planning demonstrations in Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis, Detroit, Milwaukee and Flint, Michigan, this week.

Millions of working families and individuals in the United States struggle to live on pay that is at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25, which when adjusted for inflation, is worth 22 percent less than in 1968 ($9.27) and 7 percent less than in 2009 ($7.78), according to figures provided by the progressive Washington, D.C.-based Economic Policy Institute.

U.S. President Barack Obama, state and federal lawmakers, and even some corporate executives have proposed raising the federal minimum wage as a way to help lift some workers out of poverty.

The $200 billion U.S. fast-food industry has long opposed a minimum wage increase because labor is one of their largest costs.

MACHINES MAY REPLACE WORKERS

The Washington, D.C.-based Employment Policies Institute (EPI) ad responding to the workers' demands said that raising their wages to $15 an hour would hurt restaurant operators and force them to "replace employees with less-costly, automated alternatives like touch-screen ordering and payment devices."

"The dollar menu is going to be the $5 menu and (restaurants) are going to lose sales, or they're going to have to find a way to provide the same product with less service," Michael Saltsman, EPI's research director, told Reuters.

Restaurant owners already are testing automated ordering and payments systems to save money. They also work to boost profits by moving workers to part-time from full-time and by assigning very short shifts to cover busy periods.

The response from EPI - which is funded by businesses, individuals and foundations and led by Rick Berman, a powerful lobbyist for the tobacco, alcohol, food and beverage industries - comes as protests by low-wage workers in the restaurant and retail industry are growing and attracting more media coverage.

McDonald's did not respond to a request for comment.

Devonte Yates, 21, a McDonald's worker in Milwaukee, makes $7.25 per hour and said he can only get anywhere from nine to 20 hours a week even though he'd like to work more.

Yates said he is often on call, which makes it difficult to take a second job. When he does get called to work, there is no guarantee he will get a full, eight-hours.

"The shortest shift I've ever worked is 90 minutes," he said, adding that it takes him that long to get to work on the bus, which costs $4.50 per round trip.

pathogenic strain of avian influenza was found in the state in June, U.S. government and industry officials said on Tuesday

"All poultry and poultry products shipped from the State of Arkansas on or after July 22, 2013 are ineligible for export," the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said on its web site on Tuesday.

The Chinese government posted an official notification on its website, USA Poultry &amp; Egg Export Council spokesman Toby Moore told Reuters.

"As an industry we are disappointed because we hoped China would take the high road and not ban the whole state and limit the ban to the county because it was an isolated incident," Moore said.

Arkansas is the second largest U.S. chicken producer behind Georgia.

In June, tests found about eight birds in an Arkansas flock of 9,000 breeder chickens in Scott County were positive for the H7N7 low-pathogen avian flu, a state poultry official said at the time. The flock was humanly euthanized and buried and the eggs they produced were destroyed.

The influenza is a milder strain of the flu that caused dozens of deaths in China and crippled its poultry industry. Also, the virus found in Arkansas does not pose a threat to humans, state and industry officials said.

Neither the meat or the eggs would have entered the food chain.

The Arkansas farm supplied birds to Tyson Foods Inc.

In response, Tyson said in June it planned to step up its bio-security measures and surveillance of avian influenza and test all area breeder farms that serve the company.

A Tyson spokesman could not be reached for comment regarding China's ban on Arkansas poultry.



headline: First defense witness in Boston mob trial waffles on role in case
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

A prosecutor in the murder and racketeering trial of Boston gangster James "Whitey" Bulger on Tuesday attacked the credibility of the defense's first witness, a former FBI agent who published a book on the former mob boss.

The prosecutor, Brian Kelly, repeatedly asked former agent Robert Fitzpatrick whether he had been present on the cold January 2000 morning when some of the bodies of the 19 people Bulger is accused of murdering were exhumed, as Fitzpatrick claimed in his book, "Betrayal: Whitey Bulger and the FBI agent who fought to bring him down."

Fitzpatrick first said he did not recall if he had been present for the exhumation, then said the event was etched in his memory. That prompted Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelly to ask Fitzpatrick if he was taking medication that had affected his memory, to which the beefy 73 year-old replied, "Not that I recall."

Fitzpatrick also said, "This book, as a memoir, is a recitation of many things."

He was the first witness called by Bulger's lawyers as they began to present their defense. Fitzpatrick told the jury on Monday that he did not believe Bulger had been a productive FBI informant as prosecutors contend.

It was unclear whether the former head of Boston's Winter Hill crime gang, will testify in his own defense on charges linked to 19 murders he is accused of committing or ordering in the 1970s and '80s.

NOT AN INFORMANT

Bulger, 83, has pleaded not guilty to all charges, though his attorneys have admitted their client was a drug dealer, extortionist, loan shark and "organized criminal."

But what his lawyers have argued most vociferously is that Bulger was not, as prosecutors contend, an FBI informant.

Fitzpatrick said he advised his superiors to close out Bulger as an informant, a move that would have allowed the bureau to begin investigating his crimes.

"They disagreed, they didn't do it, it was not done," Fitzpatrick said. "I didn't like it, there was nothing I could do about it ... The FBI wanted to keep Bulger open."

Bulger, who inspired the character played by Jack Nicholson in the 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed," contends he paid corrupt FBI agents for information but provided none of his own.

Becoming an informant, a "rat" in the parlance of Boston's Irish gangs was a severe breach of the mob code. During the first seven weeks of the trial, prosecution witnesses testified that Bulger killed several people because he was convinced they were talking, or might talk, to authorities.

Early in the trial, Bulger shouted curses at former associate Kevin Weeks when he testified that Bulger had been an informant.

Bulger fled Boston in 1994 after a tip from another FBI agent, John Connolly and remained on the lam for 16 years, many of them listed on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list. Agents caught Bulger in June 2011 living in a seaside apartment in Santa Monica, California, with about 30 guns and more than $800,000 in cash. Connolly is serving a 40-year sentence on murder and racketeering charges.



headline: U.S. slaughterhouse workers, truckers fuel deadly piglet virus spread
byline: By P.J. Huffstutter
8:31am EDT

Questionable hygiene practices among meat processing plant employees, freight truck drivers and others who work at hog slaughter houses are aiding in the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus across the United States, according to research conducted by the University of Illinois staff.

PEDv is spread most commonly by pigs ingesting contaminated feces. The virus, which is deadly to very young piglets, does not pose a health risk to humans or other animals and the meat from PEDv-infected pigs is safe for people to eat, according to federal officials.

Swine veterinarian James Lowe and a group of veterinary peers said they gathered swabs and environmental samples last month from 669 livestock trailers at seven Midwestern slaughter facilities - before and after animals were unloaded and moved into holding pens.

The researchers found that 17 percent of the trucks that pulled into the facilities during this time had trailers that were contaminated with PEDv, according to an abstract summarizing the researchers' findings that was released earlier this month. At some plants, as many as 69 percent of the trailers arriving on site were contaminated with PEDv.

Of the trailers that arrived free of PEDv, about one in 10 trailers - 11 percent - became contaminated while at these facilities.

"What happens is, the animals are unloaded on a common dock, then there's a lot of cross traffic of animals" and people, Lowe said. "It's the truck driver. It's the plant personnel. Everyone walks over the same ground or steps onto the tractor. ... So it gets on boots, on coveralls."

For every contaminated trailer that arrived at these plants, the researchers found that 1.2 contaminated trailers left the sites - moving the virus to new, previously uncontaminated locations.

While trailers can be cleaned and washed after they exit a plant facility, Lowe said, such sanitation is not mandatory. Even when equipment is cleaned, "getting rid of the PEDv off the trailer, that's physically quite hard. Then, you'd also have to make sure the boots are clean, the coveralls are clean."

The virus has proved more difficult to contain and kill than previously believed, say swine veterinarians, investigators with the U.S. Agriculture Department and others investigating how the virus is spreading from state to state.

The total number of pig deaths from the outbreak since the outbreak began this spring is not known. As of the week of July 14, researchers at federal and state veterinarian diagnostic labs had identified 378 positive cases of PEDv in 14 states.

Lowe and the other researchers gathered about 100 samples from each of the seven facilities during a seven-day period in mid-June. They then sent the samples to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory to be tested for PEDv.



headline: Obama offers 'grand bargain' on corporate tax rate, infrastructure
byline: By Steve Holland

class jobs" on Tuesday that would cut the U.S. corporate tax rate and use billions of dollars in revenues generated by a business tax overhaul to fund projects aimed at creating jobs.

The goal, as outlined in his speech to an enthusiastic audience at an Amazon.com Inc facility in southeastern Tennessee, was to break through partisan gridlock in Congress with a formula that satisfies Republicans and Democrats alike.

But there was no sign that congressional Republicans - who have fought nearly every facet of Obama's domestic agenda - would look favorably upon the president's proposal.

The president's plan combined a proposed corporate tax rate cut - desired by Republicans - with new spending on infrastructure projects like roads and bridges as well as education investment - desired by his fellow Democrats.

"I've come here to offer a framework that might help break through the political logjam in Washington and get some of these proven ideas moving," Obama said.

Despite the olive branch, Obama's proposal immediately drew fire from the top Republicans in Congress. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said, "It's just a further-left version of a widely panned plan he already proposed two years ago - this time, with extra goodies for tax-and-spend liberals."

Bickering broke out as the White House said it had tried to tell aides to John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, about the plan on Monday but, according to Obama spokesman Jay Carney, "never heard back" from them.

The president, in his speech, also jabbed at Republicans over their support for a proposed oil pipeline from Canada and their continual opposition to his ideas.

The contretemps reflected the hyperpartisan environment that has made negotiations nearly impossible in Washington. Efforts to reach a "grand bargain" between Democrats and Republicans on deficit reduction have been at an impasse for months.

New showdowns over spending are expected in the fall, as Congress confronts an October 1 deadline to pass a bill funding the government and then a White House request to raise the federal borrowing limit, known as the "debt ceiling."

Senior administration officials said Obama is not giving up on a big deficit-cutting package, but since no agreement appears imminent, he is offering a new idea to try to follow through on his 2012 re-election campaign promises to help the middle class.

But his narrow proposal on corporate taxes suggested that Obama had all but abandoned a big deal with Republicans on deficit reduction. He argued the deficit was rapidly declining anyway and no deal seemed near with his political opponents.

'THE WHITE FLAG'

The president cast his latest tax proposal as part of a menu of items he is offering to help the United States pick up its economic game in a competitive world economy.

"If we don't make these investments and reforms, we might as well throw up the white flag while the rest of the world forges ahead in a global economy," he said. "And that does nothing to help the middle class."

Obama wants to cut the corporate tax rate of 35 percent to 28 percent and give manufacturers a preferred rate of 25 percent. He also wants a minimum tax on foreign earnings as a tool against corporate tax evasion and the use of tax havens.

In exchange for his support for a corporate tax reduction, Obama wants the money generated by a tax overhaul to be used to fund such projects as repairing roads and bridges, improving education at community colleges and promoting manufacturing, senior administration officials said.

For his part, Obama, who will need Republican backing for any budget deal, had scathing words for Republican proposals on economic growth.

He spoke dismissively of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Canada, which Republicans have urged him to approve because of its economic benefits. The president said it would create only 50 permanent jobs, adding: "That's not a jobs plan."

Obama's plan to cut corporate taxes while also curtail some existing tax benefits would result in a one-time source of revenue. The White House did not say how much money would be raised, but Obama called for $50 billion for infrastructure spending in his State of the Union speech in February.

Republicans contended that by spending the revenue, it would violate Obama's previous commitment to a "revenue-neutral" overhaul of corporate taxes.

Administration officials said they recognize that the climate is difficult in Congress with Republicans adamantly refusing anything that is seen as increasing spending and Democrats in no mood to cut taxes and get nothing for it.

The president, who has failed in several tries to reach a comprehensive fiscal accord with Republicans, accused them of holding a personal grudge against him and called for a good-faith exchange of ideas.

"If folks in Washington really want a grand bargain, how about a grand bargain for middle-class jobs?" Obama said.

"I don't want to go through the same old arguments where I propose an idea and the Republicans just say, 'No,' because it's my idea. So I'm going to try offering something that serious people in both parties should be able to support," he added.

Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, criticized the proposal even before Obama's speech, saying: "Republicans want to help families and small businesses, too. This proposal allows President Obama to support President Obama's position on taxes and President Obama's position on spending, while leaving small businesses and American families behind."

A former New York lawyer convicted in a terrorism case is seeking to get out of prison because she is dying from cancer, according to a court document filed by her lawyer.

Lynne Stewart, 73, is suffering from stage IV breast cancer, according to the document filed on Monday, which requests that her sentence be vacated or modified to time-served.

"Ms. Stewart is dying and her ability to function is rapidly deteriorating every day," lawyer Jill Shellow wrote.

A federal jury in New York convicted Stewart in 2005 of helping her client, blind Egyptian cleric Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, smuggle messages from prison to the Islamic Group in Egypt.

The Islamic Group is listed by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization. Abdel-Rahman was convicted in 1995 of conspiring to attack the United Nations and other New York City landmarks.

In 2006, Stewart was sentenced to 28 months in prison. In 2009, after a government appeal, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the sentence was insufficient. In 2010 she was re-sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Stewart was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005, and it returned last year, according to the document.

The cancer has also spread into Stewart's lungs and lymph nodes, it said. She needs help bathing, and suffers from the side effects of chemotherapy treatments. One of her doctors believes she may not live more than a year, according to the document.

The son of disgraced Chinese senior politician Bo Xilai does not plan to return to his homeland for his father's trial as he prepares for his first year at Columbia Law School in New York, according to two people familiar with the situation.

Last week, China charged Bo Xilai, 64, with bribery, abuse of power and corruption, in the country's biggest political scandal since the 1976 downfall of the Gang of Four at the end of the Cultural Revolution. Bo, who has not been seen in public for 17 months, could appear in a court in the eastern Chinese city of Jinan within weeks.

Meanwhile, his son, Bo Guagua, 25, has enrolled at the prestigious Columbia law school in New York City, where he begins his orientation next month, according to two people familiar with the situation. They said he would not be attending his father's trial.

A Columbia school directory lists Bo as an incoming law student but the law school declined to comment on his enrollment. Bo did not return email messages seeking comment.

Since graduating from Harvard University in May 2012 with a master's degree in public policy, Bo Guagua has kept a low profile. He has a circle of friends and acquaintances in Boston and was at the Boston Marathon on April 15, when two bombs ripped through the crowd near the finish line.

Just a few blocks from the mayhem, the uninjured Bo Guagua was waiting for friends to finish the race. He was walking two small dogs and told a Reuters reporter that he had not had any contact with his mother and father in more than a year.

Guagua's mother, Gu Kailai, is in prison after being convicted last year in the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.

His friends and acquaintances say Bo would like to challenge the negative perception of his parents more forcefully but he has said very little publicly because he fears it could only make matters worse.

In the past year, Bo Guagua has talked to friends and acquaintances about the differences between the U.S. and Chinese justice systems. He has told these people, who declined to be identified, that even U.S. courts, as much as he admires them, still are not insulated from political pressures, especially when exercising judicial review.

He concedes the Chinese courts still are not fully formed and, just like before the 1803 landmark U.S. Supreme Court Case Marbury vs. Madison, politics still dominate the Chinese legal system, he has told friends.



headline: Coroner finds apparent hanging in disputed death of California inmate
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

A California prison inmate whose death was attributed by activists to his participation in a mass hunger strike appears to have died by hanging, the local medical examiner's office said on Monday after an initial examination of his body.

Billy Sell, 32, serving a life term for attempted murder at the Corcoran State Prison in central California, was found unconscious last Monday in his cell in the facility's "security housing unit," where prisoners are held in solitary confinement.

Sell, who faced further charges in the 2007 slaying of a cell mate, was pronounced dead that night at the prison's hospital in a case that prison officials said was under investigation as a suicide.

Their contention was bolstered by the initial findings of the Kings County Coroner's Office, which said Sell appeared to have died from "ligature strangulation," as if by hanging.

Deputy Coroner Tom Edmonds said a conclusive determination for the cause of death hinged on completion of an autopsy and toxicology studies.

The coroner's findings so far were at odds with the assertions from supporters of an inmate hunger strike that entered its fourth week on Monday and ranks as the largest in California prison history.

According to inmate advocates, fellow prisoners said Sell was among those refusing meals and had been requesting medical attention for several days before his death.

The hunger strike was launched July 8 to protest solitary confinement practices and other conditions cited by inmates as inhumane within the state prison system.

Officials of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation have denied that Sell had been taking part in the hunger strike prior to his death.

Isaac Ontiveros, a spokesman for the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition, said his group was seeking an independent investigation of Sell's death, and suggested that issues raised by protesting inmates were a factor.

"However this person died, could this not have been avoided by addressing the demands the hunger strikers have been making for nearly a month now?" he asked.

Thousands of inmates in high-security lockups throughout the state launched the hunger strike on July 8 to protest what advocates say is the cruel and unfair use of solitary confinement as punishment within the system.

Supporters say more than 30,000 of California's 132,800 inmates have taken part in the action.

The state says it has 4,527 inmates held in security housing units, some for committing crimes while incarcerated and others who have been identified as gang members.

Inmate advocates put the number of state prisoners confined in extreme isolation at nearly 12,000.



headline: Ohio man faces additional charges in murders of three women
byline: By Kim Palmer
8:31am EDT

Accused serial killer Michael Madison faced additional charges on Monday in connection with the slayings of three women whose decomposing bodies were found wrapped in plastic bags around his suburban Cleveland home.

Madison, 35, a convicted sex offender, already was charged with aggravated murder and kidnapping in a case reminiscent of 11 slayings committed several years ago by Anthony Sowell, one of Cleveland's most notorious mass murderers. A grand jury on Monday charged Madison with raping his victims and abusing their corpses.

Madison was arrested July 19 after police, drawn by the stench of decomposing flesh, discovered the remains of Shirellda Terry, 18, in a garage behind his apartment in East Cleveland.

The following day the body of Shetisha Sheeley, 28, was discovered in a weeded lot two houses from Madison's apartment, and the remains of Angela Deskins, 38, were discovered in the basement of a vacant house near his home, according to police.

Two of the victims, Terry and Sheeley, were found to have been strangled. The cause of Deskins' death has yet to be determined.

During a police interview, Madison mentioned the name of Sowell, a Cleveland serial killer, according to East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton. Sowell was convicted of murdering 11 women and dumping their bodies in garbage bags in and around his home in 2009.

Aggravated murder is a capital offense in Ohio, but prosecutors have not decided whether they would seek the death penalty if Madison were convicted.

East Cleveland Municipal Judge William Dawson ordered Madison on July 22 to remain held on a $6 million bond. He is expected to be arraigned later this week.

Madison was confined in the same lockup as Ariel Castro, the former school bus driver who pleaded guilty to abducting and holding three young women captive in his home for roughly a decade during which they were starved, beaten and sexually assaulted.

He faces life in prison without parole plus 1,000 years under a plea agreement reached with prosecutors. His sentencing is scheduled for Thursday.



headline: Hawaii braces for flooding as Tropical Storm Flossie approaches
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
8:31am EDT

A tropical storm with the potential to trigger serious flooding and mudslides was bearing down on Hawaii on Monday and authorities there cautioned residents and tourists to stay inside and off the roads.

Tropical Storm Flossie was expected to strike the Big Island and Maui on Monday evening, with waves along the eastern shores of those islands likely to reach as high as 18 feet, according to the National Weather Service.

"This shouldn't be taken lightly. It's not just a rain cloud," said Brian Miyamoto, spokesman for the Hawaii State Civil Defense. "Try to prevent non-essential driving or going outside if you don't need to."

As of 11 a.m. local time (2300 GMT) the storm was about 65 miles from the Big Island â&euro;&rdquo; the easternmost island in the chain â&euro;&rdquo; traveling at 18 miles per hour with sustained wind speeds of about 40 miles per hour.

"The threat for strong winds is diminished somewhat but there's still the potential for some heavy rain and flooding," said Mike Canton, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Honolulu. "The course has it hitting right over the state."

The state's airports were still open but some airlines were cancelling flights, Miyamoto said. Along with some of the state's harbors, at least 19 state parks were closed on Monday on the Big Island, Maui, and Kauai, he said.

The Hawaii State Civil Defense was on full activation and operating on 12-hour shifts, Miyamoto added.

In anticipation of the storm, Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation on Sunday freeing up disaster funds for emergency supplies, cleanup efforts and state worker overtime pay. He also called the Hawaii National Guard to active duty to ensure it was ready to help.

In addition to nine shelters opened on the Big Island, another 10 are being set up in Honolulu County, said Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell, who urged residents and tourists to have a seven-day supply of food, water and batteries.

"Take it seriously," he said. "In Hawaii, we always plan for the worst. Most of the time it doesn't turn out as bad."

A woman was arrested for allegedly dumping green paint on portions of the National Cathedral on Monday, while police continued to investigate similar acts of vandalism at other monuments in Washington, D.C.

The Episcopal Church cathedral was locked down after the paint was found on the entrance and in two chapels. The unidentified woman was arrested after a police sweep of the premises, the Washington Metropolitan Police Department said.

"An adult female has been arrested for defacing property," police spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump told Reuters.

Police are investigating whether the woman may have been responsible for defacing the Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian Institution in the past week.

A crooked splotch of green paint was discovered on the huge statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial on Friday.

On Monday green paint was found splattered on a statue of Joseph Henry, the first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Some of the paint had been scrawled into images that looked like a cross between stick figures and hieroglyphs.

"It's just unfortunate that people could be so disrespectful. It's too bad," said Elisa Rogers, of Ormond Beach, Florida, who was visiting Washington with her family.

sodomy law that the U.S. Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a decade ago.

City Councilmember John Delgado said he "was incensed" when he read a Baton Rouge Advocate newspaper article on Sunday reporting that the local sheriff's office had arrested a dozen men in the last two years on charges they violated a state law prohibiting sex between two persons of the same gender. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that such laws are not valid.

"Those officers had to have known the law is unconstitutional," said Delgado, a lawyer. "I think it's a policy of harassment that targets a specific segment of the population."

About a dozen men were booked on the felony charge of attempted crime against nature in one neighborhood and two of the arrests were as recent as July, the local district attorney said.

The sheriff's office issued a statement on Sunday saying it "has not, nor will it ever, set out with the intent to target or embarrass any part of our law-abiding community." It said the arrests were an attempt to deter or stop lewd activity occurring in the park near children.

"In hindsight, however, we feel we should have taken a different approach," the statement said.

Neither East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid Gautreaux nor a spokesman for the office could be reached for comment on Monday.

All of the men were jailed and then released on bond fairly quickly, local District Attorney Hillar Moore said. The district attorney's office did not pursue the charges in any of the cases.

Delgado said the sheriff's office should apologize to the men who were detained.

"This is just infuriating, and I think it makes the city look like a backwater," he told Reuters.

The Musical" by creating an elaborate scheme involving fake overseas investors.

Mark Hotton, 46, pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and agreed to forfeit $500,000 and to pay an additional $500,000 to the victims of his schemes.

The guilty plea included a second scheme in which he sought to defraud a Connecticut-based real estate company.

Hotton faces 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud and is scheduled to be sentenced on November 1 by U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan.

Hotton's attorney, Ira London, was not immediately available for comment.

"Though his lies and deceits were the stuff of fiction, they caused real harm to his victims," Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement.

Hotton was indicted in November.

A dark, gothic thriller based on a 1938 Daphne du Maurier novel, "Rebecca" had been slated to make its Broadway debut in the fall of 2012 but was postponed because of a shortfall in financing and scandal.

The proposed budget for the show was between $12 million and $14 million.

When the producers found themselves $4 million short, they entered into an agreement in February 2012 with a company controlled by Hotton.

He was to raise money in return for a $7,500 fee and an 8 percent return on any funds raised over $250,000.

Hotton told the producers he had secured $4.5 million from overseas investors, court records said, but the men, with names like "Julian Spencer" and "Walter Timmons," were all made up.

Hotton had even demanded an advance payment from the producers in April 2012 to cover the cost of a safari he had supposedly taken with one of the fictional investors.

In January, lead producer Ben Sprecher told the Broadway publication Playbill.com that he hoped to launch the show by the end of 2013.

The case is U.S. v. Mark Hotton, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 12-825.



headline: Airline worker, wife accused of stealing luggage diverted after Asiana crash

8:31am EDT

A United Airlines customer services representative and his wife have been arrested in the theft of unclaimed luggage from a flight that had been diverted after the July 6 fatal crash of an Asiana Airlines plane, a county prosecutor said on Monday.

Sean Sharif Crudup, 44, was charged with grand theft and burglary, said Karen Guidotti, chief deputy district attorney for San Mateo County. His wife, Raychas Elizabeth Thomas, 32, will be arraigned in August, Guidotti said.

Guidotti said video surveillance showed Crudup taking the bags and handing them to his wife. She said Thomas later unpacked the luggage and returned much of the clothing to a Nordstrom department store, pocketing about $5,000 cash.

Nordstrom spokesman Colin Johnson declined to comment on the incident, but he confirmed that the chain allows stores to make return decisions on a case-by-case basis.

The luggage belonged to a couple whose flight had been scheduled to arrive at San Francisco International Airport on the day of the Asiana Airlines crash. Their flight was diverted to another airport, but their suitcases were sent on to San Francisco.

The couple discovered their luggage was missing when they went to San Francisco to retrieve it, Guidotti said.

Crudup and his wife were arrested on Thursday, authorities said. He was charged on Friday and released on $75,000 bail. Thomas was out of custody on $50,000 bail and will be arraigned in August.

United spokesman Christen David said the airline was assisting investigators in the case. "We hold our employees to the highest standard and have zero tolerance for any theft," he said.

Three Chinese teenagers died and dozens of passengers were injured when the Asiana Boeing 777 hit a seawall in front of the runway, lost its tail and caught fire after skidding to a halt.



headline: Verdict to be read on Tuesday for Bradley Manning WikiLeaks case
byline: By Medina Roshan
8:31am EDT

martial of the soldier accused of the biggest leak of classified information in U.S. history, the judge said, with the biggest question whether he will be convicted of the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, carrying a life sentence.

Legal observers said it was highly likely that Army Private First Class Bradley Manning, who in March pleaded guilty to lesser charges related to sharing some 700,000 documents with the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website in 2010, will be found guilty on at least some of the 21 criminal counts.

"The difficult part is did he know that the information was going to Al-Qaeda and the Taliban? To me, that is the linchpin of the case," said Richard Rosen, a professor of law at the Texas Tech University School of Law and a former military lawyer. "If he's not found guilty of that charge, the punishment is going to be a lot less severe in my opinion."

Judge Colonel Denise Lind said on Monday that she plans to issue her verdict in the case at 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) on Tuesday in Fort Meade, Maryland.

Manning, originally from Crescent, Oklahoma, opted to have his case heard by Lind, rather than a panel of military jurors.

Military prosecutors have called the 25-year-old defendant a "traitor" for publicly posting information that the U.S. government said could jeopardize national security and intelligence operations.

Lawyers for the low-level intelligence analyst said Manning was well-intentioned but naive, hoping that his disclosures would provoke a more intense debate in the United States about diplomatic and military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

More than three years after Manning's arrest in May 2010, the U.S. intelligence community is reeling again from leaked secrets, this time exposed by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who has been holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport for more than a month despite U.S. calls for Russian authorities to turn him over.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has surfaced again as a major player in the newest scandal, this time aiding Snowden in eluding authorities to seek asylum abroad.

The cases of Manning and Snowden, a former contractor for a U.S. spy agency, illustrate the difficulties of keeping secrets at a time the internet makes them very easy to share widely and quickly. In addition, more people are granted access to classified data.

"The bar has become very low for what the government has to prove in order to convict someone for disclosing classified information to the media," said Elizabeth Goitein, a security specialist at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice.

She said that military courts had made it easier to convict people on charges of aiding the enemy.

"There has been a heightened standard of intent that has been required," Goitein said. "We're really starting to see the court chip away at this."



headline: Arkansas water park closes after rare meningitis confirmed

old girl who swam there was diagnosed with a rare case of parasitic meningitis, authorities said on Monday.

The Arkansas Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the case last week. The owners of Willow Springs Water Park, which has been operating for 85 years, closed the park on Friday.

The disease is caused by a "brain-eating amoeba," according to the CDC website, that is found in warm rivers, lakes and streams, primarily in the southern United States.

The parasite can cause a rare but severe brain infection that is usually fatal. When the parasite enters the body through the nose, the illness can occur, the Arkansas Department of Health said.

Arkansas Health Department spokesman Ed Barham said tests determined the amoeba was present in the water at the park.

The girl was in critical condition at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, CBS affiliate KTHV reported on Monday.

This is only the sixth case of the disease in Arkansas in 40 years, the health department said, adding that the last case was 2010. There were only 31 cases of the infection in the United States from 2003 to 2012, the CDC said.

"It is exceedingly rare," said Dirk Haselow, a state epidemiologist. "A sporadic case occurs one in 33 million."

Eight people including three children were injured in Philadelphia on Monday when a natural gas explosion tore through a row house under renovation, causing the collapse of three houses and the evacuation of about 70 homes.

Among those injured was a man who was hospitalized with severe burns and listed in critical condition and a child who had suffered minor injuries, the office of Philadelphia Michael Nutter said in a statement.

Firefighters were searching the rubble with listening devices to ensure that no one remained trapped, the mayor's office said.

Residents reported a strong smell of natural gas after the blast and Philadelphia Gas Works crews shut off gas to the area, utility spokeswoman Melanie McCottry said.

Hundreds of people watched as emergency workers and firefighters went about clearing 15 feet of rubble and debris that spilled onto the street from the collapsed home.

One resident of the neighborhood, Diane Schaffer, said the smell of gas had permeated the area since early Monday morning. After the explosion, she put her son and a neighbor's daughter in her car and fled the area.

"I could hear a guy saying, 'Help me, help me,' but when I looked back, I saw two guys running towards him, so I felt OK about leaving," Schaffer said. "We just sped off."

Early last month, a four-story building under demolition in the city collapsed, killing six people and injuring 14 as it fell onto an adjoining Salvation Army Thrift Store, burying shoppers in debris.



headline: Ex-football coach testifies in Sandusky scandal
byline: By Dave Warner
8:31am EDT

up case against former school officials testified at their court hearing on Monday.

Mike McQueary told of a series of talks he had with late Penn State coach Joe Paterno in February 2001, including the morning after he spotted Sandusky sexually abusing a child in the locker room showers.

"I had seen Jerry Sandusky engaged in a very bad sexual act, a molestation act, with a minor," McQueary testified he told Paterno. He also testified that he told other university officials about the incident - including two of the three officials appearing at Monday's hearing. None reported it to police.

Sandusky, 69, a former assistant football coach, was convicted in June 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse involving 10 boys. He is serving a sentence of 30 years to 60 years in a state prison.

McQueary lost his job as a receivers coach after charges were filed against Sandusky in November 2011. His testimony opened a preliminary hearing in the criminal case against the college's former president, Graham Spanier, 65; its former athletic director, Tim Curley, 59; and its former senior vice president Gary Schultz, 63.

The three university officials are accused of a "conspiracy of silence" for failing to report the shower incident to authorities, which permitted Sandusky to continue preying on boys, most of whom he met through a charity he founded for at-risk youth.

McQueary, who testified he also told Curley and Schultz of the shower incident, said Paterno told him in the months following the shower incident "Old Main screwed up," using a nickname for the administrative center of Penn State.

Sandusky was arrested in November 2011 and charged with molesting boys. A year later, in November 2012, a grand jury charged Spanier, Curley and Schultz with endangering the welfare of children, criminal conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Spanier also was charged with perjury.

Curley and Schultz were previously charged in November 2011 with perjury and failure to report suspected abuse.

Spanier was fired from Penn State; Curley was placed on administrative leave and Schultz had already retired from the school.

Harrisburg District Judge William Wenner will decide if there is enough evidence to bring the case to trial after the preliminary hearing.

Within weeks of Sandusky's arrest, Penn State Trustees fired Spanier, at the time the nation's highest-paid public university president. Trustees also fired Paterno, Sandusky's boss. Months later, Paterno, a legendary figure in college football died of lung cancer at the age of 85.

Civil lawsuits filed by the victims, now grown men, against the university are close to being settled, with the school putting aside $60 million to cover the claims, according to a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs. The attorney said there were as many as 32 claims from alleged victims.

McQueary also has filed a whistleblower and defamation lawsuit against Penn State, accusing the school of not renewing his contract because he cooperated with authorities investigating Sandusky and the Penn State officials.

And, Spanier's lawyers have served legal notice that they intend to file defamation charges against Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Freeh was the author of a study, commissioned by the university, spelling out a narrative of the scandal that many in the state rejected, including the Paterno family.

The Freeh report prompted the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing body for college sports, to issue sanctions against Penn State. The NCAA imposed a $60 million fine and voided the 14 seasons of football victories Sandusky coached.

headline: Black lawyer group urges Florida governor to repeal 'Stand Your Ground'
byline: By Kevin Gray
8:31am EDT

A leading group of black lawyers on Monday urged Florida's governor to call a special legislative session to repeal the state's "Stand Your Ground" law after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.

"Stand Your Ground must fall," said John Page, the president of the National Bar Association, one of the oldest organizations of African-American lawyers, during the group's annual meeting in Miami Beach, Florida.

Civil rights groups have stepped up calls for Governor Rick Scott to ask state lawmakers to overhaul the law. Dozens of students this month staged a sit-in in Tallahassee, the state's capital, also urging him to repeal it.

But Scott has repeatedly said he supports Stand Your Ground and has no plans to call a special session. Recent polls show a majority of Floridians also back the law, which was first passed in 2005 with overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats alike.

"I'm asking Governor Scott - convene a session," Page said. "We're asking you to act."

Dennis Baxley, a Florida state representative who sponsored the law, has also said he sees no need to overhaul it. He has argued the law has helped to lower crime rates in Florida.

Under Stand Your Ground, people fearing for their lives can use deadly force without having to retreat from a confrontation, even when it is possible.

Earlier this month, a jury acquitted Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the killing of Martin, a black 17 year old.

Critics contend that Zimmerman racially profiled Martin when he followed him in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman said he acted in self-defense and shot Martin after the teenager punched him and smashed his head into a concrete sidewalk.

While Zimmerman did not invoke Stand Your Ground in his defense, one member of the jury has said there was a reference to the law in the jury instructions.

A second member of the jury has called for changes to Florida's self-defense law, which she said gave jurors no option but to acquit.

Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, appeared alongside Page on Monday. She said she believed the Stand Your Ground law contributed to Zimmerman's not guilty verdict.

"The thing about this law is I just think it assisted the person who killed my son to get away with murder," Fulton said. "We have to change these laws so that this doesn't happen to somebody else's child."

The Humane Society said it contributed the maximum $1,000 to the World Versatility Show under way through Saturday in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, to highlight a better way to train and show the horses known for their exaggerated steps.

The owners and trainers of Tennessee Walking Horses, a popular breed in the American South, have been criticized for decades over a practice called "soring" - slathering the lower legs with caustic chemicals to induce pain that causes the horse to step higher. While chemical soring is officially banned, it is suspected that some trainers still use it.

In 2011, the Humane Society produced an undercover video of a celebrated walking horse trainer, Jackie McConnell, abusing horses at his stable. The video, broadcast on ABC television last year, showed the animals being beaten with sticks and poked with electric cattle prods. It also exposed that soring was used in their training.

McConnell, 61, pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges this month, and was banned from owning and training horses for 20 years. He also was fined $25,000 and sentenced to a year's house arrest and four years probation.

Eight horses were removed from McConnell's training barn and are being kept at an undisclosed location, authorities said.

The alternative show this weekend does not include the controversial "Big Lick," an artificial movement in which the horses raise their forelegs up and forward.

The Big Lick is produced by "padding" a horse with thick front horseshoes that animal rights groups say are abusive. The alternative show will restrict the horses to light shoes, or barefoot without shoes, and the animals are judged by natural talent in events such as jumping, reining and driving.

If a horse can perform the Big Lick naturally, it is allowed at the alternative show.

"We do want to help the Tennessee Walking Horse to be the horse of the future and move away from the reliance of abusive training practices and devices that the breed has been associated with," said Keith Dane, director of equine protection for the Humane Society of the United States.

The Humane Society, along with other animal rights groups, has been aggressive in recent years in exposing cruelty to animals. They have used controversial undercover operations to expose abusive farming practices at chicken, beef and pork facilities. Some Midwestern state legislatures have banned undercover operations at agricultural facilities.

The alternative show is taking place one month before the prestigious 75th annual Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration in Shelbyville, where the Big Lick will be performed.

Mike Inman, chief executive of the National Celebration, said the event does not condone soring, but allows the use of thick shoes.

"The difference in equipment and shoeing accentuate the natural ability of the athlete, it doesn't provide the ability," he said.

Mike Dunavant, Fayette County district attorney general, who prosecuted trainer McConnell, praised the alternative show as highlighting better practices.

"(It) promotes people who engage in the humane treatment and training of Tennessee Walking Horses," he said.

treated that she had access to amenities like a spa and pool and went shopping at local malls.

The 42-year-old princess is charged with bringing the woman to the United States in May, confiscating her passport and paying her $220 a month to work 16 hours a day, seven days a week, while essentially holding her captive in a situation Orange County's top prosecutor likened to slavery.

Meshael Alayban, described as a wife of Saudi Prince Abdulrahman bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz al Saud, was arrested earlier this month at her apartment in suburban Irvine, southeast of Los Angeles, and charged with human trafficking.

Authorities say the case came to light after the Kenyan woman, who is around 30 years old, escaped from the residence and flagged down a bus driver. Officers who went to the home found four Filipino women whose status was unclear, and prosecutors have said that more charges may be filed.

Lawyers for Alayban contradicted that version of events, saying the nannies working for their client's family had traveled first-class to the United States.

"These women had cellphones, Internet, Facebook, and the family even bought cable in their native language for them," attorneys Paul Meyer and Jennifer Keller said in a statement issued to reporters following a brief hearing in the case in Santa Ana.

"They enjoyed full use of the spa, gym, and pool and were often dropped off to shop alone at neighborhood malls, all paid for by the family," the statement said.

Many households in the Gulf Arab region, including Saudi Arabia, are highly dependent on domestic servants, including maids and nannies from African and South Asian countries who sometimes work long hours and may see their passports held by their employers.

Some employers have landed on the wrong side of the law in Western countries. A Saudi princess was accused of mistreating a servant in Florida more than a decade ago, and another was taken to court in Boston in 2005 on charges of forced labor. Media reports said in both cases the women later pleaded guilty to lesser charges.

During Monday's court hearing in Orange County, which Alayban did not attend, Superior Court Judge Gerald Johnston postponed her arraignment on the charges for the second time at the request of defense attorneys, scheduling it for September.

Johnston appeared irked that the princess was not present for the hearing, telling her lawyers that despite a legal waiver for her appearance he wanted her in court for all proceedings.

Alayban had previously been released after posting $5 million bail but was ordered to remain in Southern California and wear a GPS device to monitor her whereabouts.

In announcing the charges earlier this month, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said it was the first case prosecuted in Orange County under California's voter-approved Proposition 35, which toughens penalties for human trafficking.

"It's been 150 years since the Emancipation Proclamation so slavery has been illegal in the United States and certainly in California all this time. It's disappointing to see it in use here," Rackauckas said at the time.

headline: Ohio kidnapper's son says life in prison is best for all
byline: By Jane Sutton and Kim Palmer
8:31am EDT

The son of the Ohio man who held three women captive for years said on Monday that he was happy his father pleaded guilty in a deal that spared him the death penalty and spared his victims from repeated court appearances.

"In death penalty cases, you end up in court a lot and so they come back a lot more often," Anthony Castro said on Monday on NBC News' "Today" program in his first television interview. "I think this way is a lot better because he's sent himself away and he will be away for the rest of his life."

Former school bus driver Ariel Castro, 53, pleaded guilty last week in Cleveland to 937 charges, including kidnapping and repeatedly raping three young women he abducted between 2002 and 2004. He also pleaded guilty to murder for impregnating one of the young woman and causing her to miscarry by assaulting her.

Castro is scheduled to be formally sentenced on August 1 after he agreed to serve life without parole, plus 1,000 years.

The women were chained and tied up for long periods and subjected to starvation, beatings and sexual assaults. On May 6, neighbors heard cries for help from Amanda Berry, 27, and helped her escape Castro's house along with her six-year-old daughter, fathered by Castro.

Berry then called 911 and police rescued Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32, from the second floor of the house.

Anthony Castro, 31, said he felt "overwhelming joy" when he first heard the women had been found and freed but was horrified when he learned from Berry's 911 call that it was his father who had held them.

Anthony Castro had been a journalism student at Bowling Green University in Ohio in 2004 when he wrote an article about the three missing women.

"I was shocked because of the magnitude of such a crime. I don't think I could imagine anyone doing that, let alone finding out it was my own flesh and blood, my father," Anthony Castro said.

Anthony Castro, who lives and works in Columbus, is the only son born to Ariel and Grimelda Figueroa. They had three daughters, including Emily Castro, who is in prison serving a 25-year sentence after being convicted of attempting to murder her baby daughter in 2007 by slashing her throat.

He said his father was violent, "incredibly strict" and regularly beat him and his mother, who died last year.

Figueroa accused Castro of abuse in 1989. Castro pleaded no contest and was given a year of probation. Figueroa was granted full custody of their children by 1997, according to Cuyahoga County court documents.

After a court hearing last week, Berry was seen on the stage of a Cleveland concert waving and shaking the hands of members of the cheering crowd. It was the first public appearance by any of the women since their rescue.

DeJesus also appeared in a short interview with a local Cleveland TV news station with her mother on Sunday. In the interview with WEWS, Nancy Ruiz, DeJesus' mother, told a reporter her daughter has been in contact with the other women and has visited each other.

Anthony Castro said he had visited his father's fortress-like home a few times in the last decade but had no idea the women were there and did not suspect anything was wrong. He stayed outside or entered through the back door and never went beyond the kitchen, he said.

Even when he lived there as a child, he said, the basement, attic and garage were locked, the windows were nailed shut and parts of the house were off-limits, he said.

His son said he will not visit his father in prison and has nothing to say to him.

According to jail logs, Castro has only been visited by his mother and sister during the nearly three months he has been incarcerated.

"He's been lying to his family for the past 10, 11 years at every possible turn," Anthony Castro said. "I have no trust in him. I can't see myself going to visit him and giving him the opportunity to face me and lie to me again."

Five people including a child were killed on Saturday when a helicopter crashed in a heavily wooded area of northeastern Pennsylvania, officials said on Sunday.

The wreckage of a Robinson 66 helicopter was found in a rugged area in Noxen, about 21 miles west of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Sunday afternoon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

The dead include three men, one woman and one male child, according to Wyoming County coroner Thomas Kukuchka. He said they are believed to be a father and his son, a father and his daughter, and the pilot. He could not release their identities.

A state police spokesman confirmed multiple fatalities but could not provide any more information.

The helicopter was en route to the Jake Arner Memorial Airport in Lehighton, Pennsylvania, on Saturday night, according to the FAA.

The helicopter was coming from the an airport in Binghamton, New York, the FAA said, but a representative for that airport said the aircraft originated in the Tri-Cities Airport in Endicott, New York.

An alert notice was issued after the aircraft lost radar and communication contact Saturday night, according to the FAA.

The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the accident.



headline: Police find body of 'best man' missing after Hudson River boat crash

8:31am EDT

The body of the "best man" killed when a speedboat carrying six members of an upcoming wedding party smashed into a barge on the Hudson River on Friday night was found in the river on Sunday, Rockland County Sheriff William Barbera said.

Mark Lennon, 30, who was to be the best man in the August 10 wedding, was killed along with a woman believed to be the bride, said county Sheriff William Barbera.

The sheriff's office said the boat hit a construction barge anchored below the Tappan Zee Bridge, part of the New York State Thruway and a major transportation link across the Hudson River about 25 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.

The body of a woman was pulled from the water on Saturday by crews searching for two people missing after the accident, Barbera said.

Barbera would not confirm local media reports that gave her name as fiance Lindsey Stewart, 30.

Lennon was found at around 11 a.m. local time one mile south of the riverside town of Piermont, which is just south of the bridge.

The driver of the boat, Jojo John, 35, had consumed alcohol and was "intoxicated" at the time of the crash, Barbera said.

John was charged with one count of vehicular manslaughter and three counts of second-degree vehicular assault and remains in custody at a local hospital.

Three others were taken to area hospitals, authorities said.

Barbera said that the night was clear but very dark "because there was less than a full moon."

"But there were lights on the barge," he said.

Despite suffering serious head injuries, Stewart's fiance, Brian Bond, called 911 at 10:41 p.m., saying that the speedboat had struck an object south of the bridge, according to CNN.

The rescue was "delayed because he was unsure of where he was," Barbera said.

According to media reports, the couple had been friends since childhood in the suburbs north of New York City and went to the same church in the town of Pearl River, several miles west of the Hudson.

The New York State Thruway Authority is conducting a review of safety procedures on the Hudson River, Brian Conybeare, special advisor to Governor Andrew Cuomo, said in a release.

Tappan Zee Constructors, the company doing the bridge project, said the barges were properly lit on Friday night when the accident occurred.

headline: Ex-FBI agent calls Boston mob boss 'Whitey' Bulger a reluctant snitch
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

Notorious mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger peered from behind dark glasses and a Boston Red Sox baseball cap at former FBI agent Robert Fitzpatrick the first time they met, and the agent realized this was no average informant.

"I couldn't see his soul," Fitzpatrick on Monday told the jury hearing Bulger's murder and racketeering trial, adding he quickly concluded that Bulger had no intention of sharing information with the FBI.

Fitzpatrick was the first witness called by Bulger's attorneys as they began to present their defense. It was unclear whether the former head of Boston's Winter Hill crime gang, 83, would testify in his own defense on charges linked to 19 murders he is accused of committing or ordering in the 1970s and '80s.

Bulger has pleaded not guilty to all charges, though his attorneys have admitted their client was a drug dealer, extortionist, loan shark and "organized criminal." But what his lawyers have argued most vociferously is that Bulger was not, as prosecutors contend, an FBI informant.

Fitzpatrick testified that Bulger kept dodging his questions, and the agent quickly determined that he was not a cooperative source.

"At one point, he even said he was not an informant," Fitzpatrick said. "At that point, I made a mental reservation, 'What am I doing here? What's going on here?'"

Bulger, who inspired the character played by Jack Nicholson in the 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed," contends he paid corrupt FBI agents for information but provided none of his own.

Becoming an informant, a "rat" in the parlance of Boston's Irish gangs was a severe breach of the mob code. During the first seven weeks of the trial, prosecution witnesses testified that Bulger killed several people because he was convinced they were talking, or might talk, to authorities.

Early in the trial, Bulger shouted curses at former associate Kevin Weeks when he testified that Bulger had been an informant.

Fitzpatrick, a beefy 73-year-old with a thick mustache, said he decided to meet with Bulger in early 1981 after being named assistant special agent in charge of the Boston bureau of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and ordered to look into the office's relationship with Bulger.

UNCOOPERATIVE INFORMANT

FBI agent John Connolly and his supervisor John Morris had developed Bulger as their office's most highly placed informant, who they billed as a key source of information that they could use against the Italian Mafia, then a top FBI target.

But other law enforcement agencies, including the Massachusetts State Police, had begun to complain about what they said was preferential treatment for the gang boss.

Fitzpatrick said Bulger told him that he was the head of the Winter Hill gang, which made the agent even more wary.

"You can't have the head of a gang as an informant, because then you're validating the gang, you're actually part of the management process if you will," Fitzpatrick recalled.

He told the jury he returned to the office and told his boss it was time to close off Bulger as an informant, allowing the FBI to turn its investigative forces on the gang boss.

Bulger rose to power with the help of Connolly, who shared his Irish ethnicity and South Boston upbringing and turned a blind eye to the Winter Hill gang's crimes in exchange for information the FBI could use against the Italian Mafia.

Bulger fled Boston in 1994 after a tip from Connolly, who is serving a 40-year sentence on murder and racketeering charges, and remained on the lam for 16 years, many of them listed on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list. Agents caught up with him in June 2011, living in a seaside apartment in Santa Monica, California, with about 30 guns and more than $800,000 in cash.



headline: Detroit again leans on Tigers, other teams to lift city's spirits
byline: By Joseph Lichterman
8:31am EDT

For five days in July 1967 riots tore apart Detroit, exacerbating racial tensions, and forcing the National Guard to quell the violence.

The Tigers, Detroit's Major League Baseball team, felt immense pressure to win the next season to help bring the city together.

"They pretty much understood to a man that if they had a successful season and won the pennant ... it would help hold the city together," said Tim Wendel, author of "Summer of â&euro;&tilde;68: The Season That Changed Baseball, and America, Forever."

That October, the Tigers won baseball's World Series.

"We definitely had a good influence on the people, having something positive to talk about," Al Kaline, a member of the 1968 team and a baseball Hall of Famer, said in an interview. "If you went to the grocery shop, you'd talk about the Tigers instead of the riots. If you'd go to the barbershop you'd talk about the Tigers instead of the riots."

Today, 45 years later, Detroit may again appeal to the Tigers or one of Detroit's three other major professional sports teams: the NFL's Lions, NBA's Pistons and NHL's Red Wings. This time, it will be to renew pride in a city demoralized after filing the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.

"When we go to the playoffs or the World Series, it puts Detroit on the national stage," Tigers all-star pitcher Justin Verlander said. "Sports mean a lot to the city, and it means a lot to hopefully play a small part in getting the city jump started."

The Tigers were American League champions last year, but were swept in the World Series by the San Francisco Giants. Now, they are in first place in the American League Central Division, fighting for a third straight playoff appearance. They have the highest local television ratings of any team in baseball.

"This has been one of the most hopping baseball cities in the United States of America for the past seven or eight years," Tigers manager Jim Leyland said. "Hands down. Slam dunk."

'HOCKEY TOWN'

Even after five decades of population flight that has cut the city's population by almost two-thirds, Detroit remains one of America's biggest sports towns. Its four major pro franchises have 23 championships among them. Only four North American cities have more. All its teams have made playoffs runs in the past five years.

The Tigers, Lions and Red Wings, the three teams that play within the city limits, collectively drew about 4 million spectators over their most recent seasons.

The National Basketball Association Pistons, who play their home games in suburban Auburn Hills, have struggled of late. But from 2003 to 2008, they won the 2004 National Basketball Association championship and made six-straight Eastern Conference playoff appearances.

In hockey circles, Detroit is known simply "Hockey Town," and the Red Wings are the model of consistency. One of the National Hockey League's "Original Six" franchises, the team has made the playoffs for 22 straight years, winning four Stanley Cup championships since 1997.

Over the last decade, the Wings have assembled a daunting record of 232-120 on its home ice in "the Joe," as locals call the Joe Louis Arena, named for the Detroit native who was a legendary boxing champion in the 1930s.

And then there are the Lions.

Though they made the playoffs in the 2011-12 season, the city's perennially bottom-dwelling football team has not won a National Football League championship since 1957, around the time the city's population peaked and a decade before the first Super Bowl was played. In 2008, they became the first team in NFL not to win a single game over a 16-game season.

The consistent losing has not kept fans away from games, and the Lions dominate conversation in the city throughout the fall.

But right now, it's all about the Tigers. On Friday night, the 17th sell-out crowd of the season packed into 41,782-seat Comerica Park to watch Detroit beat the Philadelphia Phillies by a 2-1 score. So far this season, the Tigers have drawn 1.8 million fans downtown for games.

"It's the only time it feels like a real city," Mike Flynn, 57, said during Friday night's game. Flynn moved to Detroit in 1980 and lived in the city for six years before moving to the suburbs.

Some people question whether the city should have helped finance expensive new stadiums for the Tigers and Lions. But others say the importance of sports in Detroit goes far beyond dollars and sense.

â&euro;&tilde;BLUE COLLAR'

The teams and the city's principal industry, car making, have close connections. William Clay Ford Sr., grandson of Henry Ford, owns the Lions. The Pistons are named for a key component in an automotive engine. The Red Wings logo features wings mounted on a car wheel.

Before the 2009 season General Motors, then itself on the verge of bankruptcy, told the Detroit Tigers it would no longer be able to sponsor the center-field fountain at Comerica Park that shoots off streams of water after Tigers home runs.

The fountain dominates the stadium's outfield, and despite multiple offers for alternative sponsorships, the Tigers decided to keep GM's logo on the fountain, along with Ford Motor Co's Blue Oval and Chrysler's Pentastar at no cost to the companies. "The Detroit Tigers support our automakers," the fountain read.

Still, some local residents are troubled by the contrast between the wealth of the teams and the impoverished city that supports them. The Tigers, for example, have the fifth highest payroll in baseball, paying players a collective $148 million. Detroit's median household income is just $27,000, roughly half the national average and the lowest of any major U.S. city.

"It's jarring to think about players making as much as they do when the community is impoverished," said Skidmore College professor Daniel Nathan, president of the North American Society for Sport History.

Yet when Lions coach Jim Schwartz was asked at a press conference last week whether the Lions, coming off a disappointing 4-12 season, needed an "emergency manager" to turn the team around, he said he welcomed the comparisons between the city and team.

"I'd like those comparisons to be resiliency, blue-collar, hard work, toughness," Schwartz said. "I think those are the things that are most important about the city of Detroit. Those are the things that I hope the Lions reflect."



headline: In cash-strapped Detroit, few question sports arena funding
byline: By Joseph Lichterman

While Detroit has become a top emblem of U.S. urban economic decline with its recent bankruptcy filing, it remains a resilient and vibrant sports town.

Major League Baseball's Tigers and the National Football League's Lions, like teams in other U.S. cities, have obtained public financing for new arenas, despite questions about their promised economic windfalls.

The Tigers' home stadium Comerica Park, which opened in 2000, was built at a cost of $300 million, 38 percent of which was publicly financed. Tigers owner Mike Ilitch, who also owns the Red Wings, paid $185 million. Indian casino revenue and a voter-approved 2 percent rental car tax and 1 percent hotel tax paid the public's share, according to the National Sports Law Institute at Marquette University.

Ford Field, the Lions' domed stadium, was built next door to Comerica and opened in 2002 at a cost of $430 million, 36 percent of which was publicly financed by the same Wayne County tourist tax and payments from the city of Detroit, the state of Michigan, and the quasi-public Downtown Development Authority. The Lions, owned by Henry Ford's grandson William Clay Ford Sr., paid $70 million. There were also $50 million in other corporate contributions, the institute said.

And while area bars and restaurants are typically packed on game days, the neighborhood is a ghost town when neither team is playing. After the games, most fans go straight back to their homes in the suburbs.

Sports economist Andrew Zimbalist, a professor at Smith College, compared the economic impact of a new stadium to that of a large grocery store or department store.

"As a general matter, stadiums and arenas basically reallocate geographically spending within a metropolitan area," he said, adding that most of the money spent at sporting events goes to cover team costs like payroll. The Tigers, for instance, have the fifth-highest payroll in baseball, paying their players a combined $148 million.

Still, a state board recently approved issuing bonds to help pay for a new arena for the Red Wings at the heart of a proposed 45-block entertainment district just north of downtown.

The total project is slated to cost $650 million. About 44 percent of the project would be financed through public sources. Most of the public money will come through state property tax abatements on the now mostly vacant land where the arena will be built.

Despite such questionable economics, the project faced only modest local opposition.

Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic leader in the Michigan State Senate, said the state would be better off investing money in areas like public safety or schools.

"I think the best investment we can make as a state is to ensure that we have good schools, that we have public safety that will show up in a time of crisis, those are the types of things that really draw residents into the city of Detroit and I would say that's the best type of investment we can make as a state if we want to get people living in the city," Whitmer said.

Nonetheless, some still contend the costs are worth it for what a new stadium contributes to a city's psyche.

"You can show me a spreadsheet, and I'll still trump you because it's the psychic benefit of having a sports club," sports historian John Thorn said. "It separates a city from thinking of itself as big league or thinking of itself as bush league."

headline: Motive a mystery in Miami area mass shooting
byline: By Zachary Fagenson
8:31am EDT

Miami police on Sunday searched for a motive for a shooting rampage in which six people were killed by a gunman who set his apartment on fire before shooting several neighbors and taking others hostage.

The police said they were investigating reports that the man, Pedro Alberto Vargas, 42, was in the process of being evicted and had prior disputes with the managers of the building.

The owner of the 90-unit apartment building was not immediately available for comment.

More than 100 police, including SWAT teams, stormed an apartment in Hialeah, a suburb of Miami, in a pre-dawn raid on Saturday, killing Vargas and rescuing two of the hostages.

"When we found him, he still had plenty of live rounds of ammunition," Hialeah Police spokesman Carl Zogby told reporters. "This was an irrational act and many times there is no rational explanation."

The weapon used in the incident, a 9-millimeter Glock handgun, was purchased legally in 2010, Zogby said.

Vargas, who arrived in the United States from Cuba in 1997, was described as a part-time graphic artist who kept largely to himself and cared for his elderly mother. He became a U.S. citizen in 2004, according to El Nuevo Herald, south Florida's main Spanish-language newspaper.

He graduated from Miami Dade College with a degree in graphic design. There were no pending civil or criminal cases filed against him in Miami-Dade County courts.

Among the victims were an elderly couple who were the building's managers and four neighbors, including a 17-year-old girl who police say was shot while trying to hide in a bathtub.

Vargas also fired 10 to 20 shots into the street, killing a man who was walking home with his 9-year-old son whom he had just picked up from boxing practice, police said.

It was the worst Miami area shooting since 1982, when 51-year-old Carl Robert Brown killed nine and wounded three others with a pump-action shotgun after a dispute over a $20 lawnmower repair.

Vargas held a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Police gave no information on where he bought the gun or details from the two-page questionnaire on the permit's application. The police said he had no military background.

According to El Nuevo Herald, neighbors knew little of the man other than that he exercised often and was regularly seen wearing gym shorts and running shoes. Neighbors say he regularly took his 83-year-old mother to doctor's appointments.

The shooting started after Vargas set fire to his apartment as well as a large amount of cash. Vargas' mother told police it was $10,000 drawn from his savings account, though the amount remains unconfirmed.

"Much if not all was burned," Zogby said.

The tragedy in Hialeah was the latest in a string of mass shootings in the U.S. including Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 26 people including 20 young children at Sandy Hook Elementary in December.

The non-profit organization Sandy Hook Promise, formed by community members in Newtown, issued a statement on the Hialeah incident.

"Our hearts are broken," the statement said. "Our spirit is not. Sending prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the Hialeah, Florida mass shooting. Another tragedy that invites us all to reflect on what individual and collective changes we can make as a nation to save lives."

spraying peaceful student protesters is seeking worker's compensation for psychiatric damage he said he suffered in the 2011 incident.

Video footage of then-campus police Lieutenant John Pike casually dousing student demonstrators in the face with a can of pepper spray as they sat on the ground at UC Davis came to symbolize law enforcement aggression against anti-Wall Street protests at the time.

Pike was suspended and ultimately left the force in July 2012, but UC officials did not disclose the circumstances of his departure.

A scathing 190-page report on the incident found that university officials and UC Davis campus police showed poor judgment and used excessive force in the confrontation, which was widely replayed on television and the Internet.

The university last fall agreed to pay $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of the 21 students who got sprayed and later reported suffering panic attacks, trauma and falling grades as a result.

Last month, Pike himself filed a worker's compensation claim with UC Davis over the incident, saying he suffered unspecified psychiatric and nervous system damage, though the document did not explain how he claimed to have been harmed, records show.

A judge is scheduled to hear Pike's claim at a worker's compensation conference in Sacramento on August 13. The case would likely go to trial if Pike and the police department fail to reach an agreement, California Department of Industrial Relations spokesman Peter Melton said on Friday.

UC Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi had asked local prosecutors to look into possible criminal charges against the police officers involved in the pepper-spraying. But the Yolo County District Attorney's office determined there was no grounds on which to bring a case.

Earlier this week, a state appellate court ruled that newspapers have a right to publish the names of all the UC Davis police officers involved in the pepper-spraying incident.

headline: California prisons, hunger-strike backers clash over inmate death
byline: By Steve Gorman
8:31am EDT

Supporters of California prison inmates staging a prolonged hunger strike said on Saturday that one of the prisoners who had been refusing meals has died, but state corrections officials said the death was under investigation as a suicide.

The inmate, identified by mediators for protesting inmates as Billy Sell, died on Monday at the Corcoran State Prison in central California, where he was serving time in a "security housing unit" for prisoners held in solitary confinement, according to the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition.

The group said in a statement that fellow inmates have reported that Sell was participating in the hunger strike, and that he had been requesting medical attention for several days before his death.

The hunger strike, which entered its 20th day on Saturday, was launched in protest against the state's solitary confinement practices and ranks as the largest in California prison history.

"Advocates are outraged at Sell's death, noting that it could have been prevented if (prison officials) had negotiated with strikers," the coalition said in its statement.

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation disputed those assertions.

"It's irresponsible and inflammatory for hunger strike supporters to say this inmate, whose death is being investigated as a suicide, died as a result of the hunger strike," the department spokeswoman Deborah Hoffman said in a statement.

She added, "The inmate was not participating in the hunger strike at the time of this death."

The statement gave no further details about the circumstances of his death, except to say that the 32-year-old inmate was found "unresponsive" in his cell on July 22 and was pronounced dead at the prison's hospital that night.

"Also, because it is the weekend, I cannot tell you if the autopsy has been completed," she said.

According to Hoffman, the inmate was serving a life term for attempted murder and was awaiting trial in connection with the 2007 slaying of a cell mate at Corcoran.

Corrections officials did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the death or the investigation.

Thousands of inmates in high-security lockups throughout the state launched the hunger strike on July 8 to protest what advocates say is the unfair and inhumane use of solitary confinement as punishment within the system.

Supporters of the striking inmates say more than 30,000 of California's 132,800 inmates have taken part in the action.

Prison officials say the number of inmates who have continued to decline at least nine consecutive meals - the minimum number that they say qualifies as a hunger strike - has dwindled to 601 inmates in nine prisons as of Saturday.

The state has 4,527 inmates held in security housing units, some for committing crimes while incarcerated and others who have been identified as gang members, according to prison officials.

Inmate advocates put the number of state prisoners confined in extreme isolation at nearly 12,000.

According to the Los Angeles Times, prison infirmaries have treated six hunger-striking inmates for conditions such as dehydration, dizziness and disorientation, and more than a dozen additional prisoners have lost 10 percent or more of their body weight from refusing meals.

There has been no indication from either side in the dispute that any inmate has faced the prospect of being force-fed.



headline: Motive a mystery in Miami area mass shooting
byline: By Zachary Fagenson
8:31am EDT

Miami police on Sunday searched for a motive for a shooting rampage in which six people were killed by a gunman who set his apartment on fire before shooting several neighbors and taking others hostage.

They said they were investigating reports that the man, Pedro Alberto Vargas, 42, was in the process of being evicted and had had disputes with the building's management.

More than 100 police, including SWAT teams, stormed an apartment in Hialeah, a heavily-Hispanic suburb of Miami, in a pre-dawn raid on Saturday, killing Vargas and rescuing two hostages.

"When we found him he still had plenty of live rounds of ammunition," Hialeah Police spokesman Carl Zogby told reporters. "This was an irrational act and many times there is no rational explanation."

The weapon used in the incident, a 9-millimeter Glock handgun, was purchased legally in 2010, Zogby said.

Vargas, who arrived in the United States from Cuba in 1997, was described as a part-time graphic artist who kept largely to himself and cared for his elderly mother. He became a U.S. citizen in 2004, according to El Nuevo Herald, south Florida's main Spanish-language newspaper.

He graduated from Miami Dade College with a degree in graphic design. There were no pending civil or criminal cases filed against him in Miami-Dade County courts.

Among the victims were two building managers and several neighbors, including a 17-year-old girl who police say was shot while trying to hide in a bathtub.

Vargas also fired 10 to 20 shots into the street, killing a man who was walking home with his 9-year-old son whom he had just picked up from boxing practice, police said.

It was the worst Miami area shooting since 1982, when 51-year-old Carl Robert Brown killed nine and wounded three others with a pump-action shotgun after a dispute over a $20 lawnmower repair.

Vargas held a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Police gave no information on where he bought the gun or details from the two-page questionnaire on the permit's application. He had no military background and there were no reports of any psychiatric issues.

According to El Nuevo Herald neighbors knew little of the man other than that he exercised often and was regularly seen wearing gym shorts and running shoes. Neighbors say he regularly took his 83-year-old mother to doctor's appointments.

The shooting started after Vargas set fire to his apartment as well as a large amount of cash. Vargas' mother told police it was $10,000 drawn from his savings account, though the amount remains unconfirmed.

"Much if not all was burned," Zogby said.

One of the three women starved, beaten and sexually assaulted for years after being kidnapped by former Ohio school bus driver Ariel Castro made a surprise public appearance on Saturday at a concert in Cleveland.

Amanda Berry, along with Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, was freed from Castro's home in a rundown area of Cleveland on May 6. The women began disappearing in 2002 and had been bound in chains and ropes during their confinement, authorities said.

Smiling and wearing a black t-shirt, jeans and sunglasses, the 27-year-old Berry received raucous applause as she walked on the stage at the RoverFest 2013 event in downtown Cleveland after being announced by local radio host Rover.

Berry pointed a finger skyward and waved and shook the hands of some of the cheering concert-goers.

"I told her she had a little bit of time to make up on the partying and you guys would help her out tonight," Rover said according to a video posted on YouTube by radio station WMMS.

Berry did not speak before exiting the stage. She was later called back by the rapper Nelly when he finished his set.

Her appearance came two days after Castro pleaded guilty to hundreds of charges of kidnapping and rape in a deal to avoid the death penalty. The move spared Berry, DeJesus, 23, and Knight, 32, from having to testify at a trial.

Castro has agreed to a sentence of life in prison without parole as part of his plea deal. His sentencing is scheduled for August 1.

and was a neighborhood watch volunteer.

"I thought, â&euro;&tilde;Boy, did he ever screw up,'" said Holder, 74, a retired fireman and five-year neighborhood patrol veteran.

In Holder's view, Zimmerman violated two basic tenets of the watch program: Never confront a person you perceive to be suspicious, and never carry a weapon while on duty.

Last weekend, a Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman, 29, of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, who was unarmed, in Sanford, Florida. The case has focused fresh attention on the civilian patrols by law enforcement and trainers.

Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, spotted Martin, who was black, as the teenager walked to the home of his father's fiancĂŠe from a convenience store. Zimmerman thought Martin looked suspicious and called the police. The two had a confrontation and Martin ended up dead.

The National Sheriffs' Association's neighborhood watch program was established in 1972 to combat a spike in suburban and rural burglaries.

It was designed to empower civilians to act as "the eyes and ears of law enforcement" without taking matters into their own hands, said John Thompson, who directs the initiative. The association's 37-page manual states that patrol members should be told that "they shall not carry weapons."

While the group is seen as an authority, fewer than a third of the estimated 90,000 neighborhood watch groups in existence nationwide have registered with it, said Thompson. Zimmerman's watch group was not among those registered, he said.

"I could show you 50 groups with 50 different sets of rules," Thompson said.

During the trial, Wendy Dorival, a civilian with the Sanford, Florida, police department, testified that she trained Zimmerman on neighborhood watch protocol, advising him to avoid initiating confrontations. It was not clear whether she counseled him on whether to carry a gun.

Barring guns from civilian patrols is a legal gray area since most U.S. citizens have the legal right to bear arms, said Kenneth Novak, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, who has studied watch programs.

Local watch groups, as private entities, are on relatively firm legal ground in setting no-weapons policies for their members, Novak said, but law enforcement agencies mandating such rules could run the risk of exceeding their authority.

"People participating in neighborhood watch enjoy all the legal protections under the Constitution, as well as state and federal law," said Novak. "That can include carrying a weapon."

Jeffrey Dehan, a sergeant who advises neighborhood watch groups as part of his duties with the Thurston County Sheriff's Office in Washington state, says it is not their role to offer guidance on whether members should carry a weapon.

"We don't advocate 'should or shouldn't,'" he said.

Carmen Caldwell, the executive director of Citizens' Crime Watch of Miami-Dade, in Florida, said that in the wake of the Zimmerman case, some trainers and others were considering new safeguards, which could include background checks on prospective members and teaching about racial profiling.

Holder, the ex-fireman from Washington, said fallout from the Trayvon Martin shooting has been minimal.

"There was concern that we would've had something negative from it," he said. "But nobody has ever said, 'You guys shouldn't be out here.' They love us. They love having us."



headline: New York mayoral hopeful Weiner loses top aide amid campaign tumult
byline: By Eric M. Johnson
8:31am EDT

The campaign manager who helped to guide Anthony Weiner's bid for New York City mayor resigned over the weekend, a spokeswoman said on Sunday, as the Democratic former Congressman grapples with slumping poll numbers and fresh revelations of his sexually charged Internet activity.

Danny Kedem, 31, who joined Weiner's long-shot campaign in early spring, helped to manage day-to-day political operations before abruptly quitting, said spokeswoman Barbara Morgan. She declined to comment on the timing or give a reason for his departure.

Weiner, 48, once a liberal voice in the U.S. Congress, resigned in June 2011 after admitting he used Twitter and other social media to send lewd pictures of himself to women he met online.

Weiner, speaking to reporters outside a Brooklyn church on Sunday, did not offer an explanation for Kedem's departure but said he had done a "remarkable job" and praised his remaining campaign staffers.

"They've dealt with a presidential level of scrutiny and they've dealt with a candidate who has made some mistakes in his past and they are coming back up now," he said.

Weiner, who launched his bid to be the next mayor of New York City earlier this year, briefly led his Democratic rivals in polls raising the possibility that he could overcome the scandal.

That momentum stalled this week when a gossip website called The Dirty published a series of sexually explicit messages and images that an unidentified young woman said she had received from Weiner, including pictures of his penis.

Weiner admitted that the messages were real and said he had continued interacting with women online as recently as last summer, more than a year after his resignation.

On Thursday, he said he had sent lewd online messages to up to three women and had exchanges with six to 10 women over the years.

"I can't tell you absolutely what someone else is going to consider inappropriate or not," Weiner said.

Recent polling shows Weiner trailing 9 percentage points behind City Council Speaker Christine Quinn with less than two months left before the Democratic primary.

In the first survey since Weiner admitted the chats had continued after his resignation from Congress, Quinn led with 25 percent among Democrats, while Weiner followed with 16 percent, according to the NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll.

Commemorating the 60th anniversary of the armistice that ended the Korean War, President Barack Obama said on Saturday that U.S. troops and their allies achieved victory in that conflict despite a lukewarm reception when they returned home.

The war ended in a stalemate in 1953, with the absence of a peace treaty resulting in a demilitarized zone that now separates North and South Korea. Pyongyang commemorated the day with a massive military parade and declared victory as well.

"Here, today, we can say with confidence that this war was no tie. Korea was a victory," Obama said to cheers from an outdoor crowd populated by war veterans from the United States and South Korea.

"When 50 million South Koreans live in freedom ... in stark contrast to the repression and poverty of the North, that's a victory; that's your legacy," he said.

The Korean War started in 1950 when the United States rallied the United Nations to send troops to counter the North's invasion of the South.

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral James Winnefeld and representatives from the South Korean government attended the event, which included a wreath-laying ceremony conducted to "Taps" before the 19 steel statues of Korean War soldiers at the memorial on Washington's National Mall.

The chairman of South Korea's National Policy Committee, Kim Jung-hoon, who represented the country's president, Park Geun-hye, acknowledged the ambiguous end to a long-fought war.

"This armistice was not the result of mere negotiations at the table," Kim said. "It was signed after endless battles, countless sacrifices and pain endured by our veterans and their grieved families."

When U.S. troops returned home, Obama said they went right back to work, with their sacrifices seemingly unacknowledged in what would become known as "The Forgotten War."

"Unlike the Second World War, Korea did not galvanize our country. These veterans did not return to parades. Unlike Vietnam, Korea did not tear at our country. These veterans did not return to protests," Obama said.

"Here in America, no war should ever be forgotten, and no veteran should ever be overlooked."

About 5,000 people attended the event, according to the commemoration committee. The crowd was filled with South Koreans and Americans alike, with spectators singing the South Korean national anthem nearly as loudly as the U.S. anthem.

Obama also acknowledged the strong military ties Washington has with South Korea, where more than 28,000 U.S. troops are now stationed. For some younger Koreans, the continued presence of troops is controversial, but the crowd erupted in applause when Obama mentioned his commitment to U.S. military supremacy.

"Our allies and adversaries must know the United States of America will maintain the strongest military the world has ever known, bar none, always," Obama said. "That is what we do."



headline: Michigan attorney general backs pensioners in Detroit bankruptcy
byline: By Susan Kelly
8:31am EDT

Michigan's Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, said on Saturday he would defend retirees who risk losing public pensions because of Detroit's bankruptcy, putting him at odds with the city's emergency manager appointed by fellow Republican Governor Rick Snyder.

Schuette, an elected official, said the Michigan state constitution is "crystal clear" in stating that pension plans are a contractual obligation that may not be diminished or impaired.

"Retirees may face a potential financial crisis not of their own making, possibly a result of pension fund mismanagement," Schuette said in a statement.

The attorney general said he would file in federal bankruptcy court on Monday on behalf of the pensioners affected by the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.

A U.S. bankruptcy court judge on Wednesday dealt a blow to Detroit's public employee unions and pension funds opposed to the filing by suspending legal challenges in Michigan state courts while he reviews the city's petition for protection from creditors.

The city's unions and pension funds had hoped to keep the fight in state court, where they felt Michigan's constitutional protections of retiree benefits would prevail against any efforts by state-appointed Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr to scale them back.

Judge Steven Rhodes ordered three lawsuits filed by city workers, retirees and pension funds halted and said that applied also to suits against Orr as well as Michigan's governor and treasurer.

In a June 14 proposal to creditors, Orr called for "significant cuts in accrued, vested pension amounts for both active and currently retired persons."

A spokesman for Orr said on Saturday the bankruptcy court would have the final say on the pension issue.

"The emergency manager plans to establish the city's eligibility to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection and then move as swiftly as possible to propose a plan of adjustment that will help create a strong and viable Detroit and will enable the city to provide essential public services to its 700,000 residents," Orr spokesman Bill Nowling said in an emailed statement.

Detroit, a former manufacturing powerhouse and cradle of the U.S. automotive industry, filed for bankruptcy protection on July 18.

The city has struggled for decades with companies moving or closing, rampant crime, shrinking population and political corruption. The city's revenue failed to keep pace with spending, leading to years of budget deficits and a dependence on borrowing to stay afloat.

Detroit has more than $18 billion of debt and unfunded liabilities. That includes $5.7 billion in liabilities for healthcare and other retiree benefits and a $3.5 billion pension liability.

Schuette said he would continue to represent governor Snyder and state agencies in legal proceedings related to the bankruptcy, even though he is taking a different view on the pension issue.

In an emailed statement, Snyder's press secretary Sara Wurfel said the governor's office expects that Schuette will "vigorously defend" its efforts as well.

"Our response is that this is an important issue, and we appreciate and support efforts to get clarity and help determine the best path moving forward that respects and is fair to pensioners and all parties," Wurfel said.



headline: Seven shot dead in Florida hostage rampage

8:31am EDT

A tenant went on a shooting rampage at a Florida apartment building, killing six people before a SWAT team killed him and rescued two neighbors he was holding hostage on Saturday, police said.

The hostages were unharmed, police in the Miami suburb of Hialeah said.

"We don't have a clear motive," said Hialeah police spokesman Carl Zogby. "This was an irrational act and many times there is no rational explanation."

Neighbors said the gunman may have been facing eviction, but police were still investigating.

The melee began on Friday evening when the gunman, identified as Pedro Vargas, 42, set fire to the apartment he shared with his mother, police said.

The building managers, 78-year-old Italo Pisciotti and Camira Pisciotti, 68, saw smoke pouring out and ran to the apartment, Zogby said.

"He came out of the door and shot both of them several times, killing them right at the scene," he said.

Vargas went back inside his burning apartment, walked out on the balcony and fired 10 to 20 shots into the street, Zogby said.

A man who lived across the street was killed as he walked from a parking lot toward his home. Vargas also shot at emergency crews and police, preventing them from giving immediate aid to the victims, police said.

The gunman then went to a third-floor apartment, kicked down the door and shot dead a couple and their 17-year-old daughter, Zogby said.

Vargas then ran through the building, firing erratically and exchanging gunfire with police as they arrived and tried to engage him. He ran to the fifth floor, where he took two people hostage and barricaded himself inside their apartment, police said.

Negotiators made contact with him during the night but the talks fell apart and the SWAT team swarmed in about 2 a.m., police said. Vargas had plenty of ammunition left and was firing and "ready to fight" when police killed him, Zogby said.

"All this while, officers are trying to save the hostages, grab them, pull them out of the apartment while this gun battle was going on," he said.

Police initially said Vargas' mother collapsed and was taken to a hospital during the chaos, but later said she had been away visiting relatives during the shootout.

The apartment complex in the blue-collar, mostly Hispanic community housed about 90 families.

More than a hundred police officers from Hialeah and surrounding communities responded to the situation. Some apartment residents were in tears as the investigation continued on Saturday. Others stood on balconies and in hallways looking bewildered.

Police said Vargas was described by neighbors as a quiet man and had no criminal history.

The ceiling and outside wall of his apartment were charred from the fire and blood from the slain building managers stained the door. Three small red flowers had been placed nearby. Down the hall were more flowers and a heart-shaped glass ashtray with three red candles burning in it.

Schools damaged by a West, Texas, fertilizer plant explosion will receive $2.75 million in federal funds for temporary classrooms and administrative buildings, the government said Friday.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency said the money cannot be used for permanent rebuilding by the cash-strapped school district, which is still fighting for resources after the April blast obliterated much of its property.

But the grant allows the town's older students, who were sent to other districts after their schools were damaged, to resume classes back home while their schools are being rebuilt.

The April 17 explosion at the plant killed 14 people and wreaked havoc on surrounding areas. Local officials said costs are approaching $100 million for city and school repairs.

FEMA in June rejected a $40 million request for aid.

Students up to 5th grade finished out the academic year at West Elementary, the only school untouched by the devastation. Students in grades sixth through 12th were bused to nearby school districts.

The district's 1,500 students will resume classes in West on August 26, with students in grades six and above using temporary, portable buildings.

A former Cleveland school bus driver who held three women captive for years pleaded guilty on Friday to hundreds of charges of kidnapping and rape, allowing him to avoid the death penalty and instead serve life in prison without parole.

At a court hearing, Ohio prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty against Ariel Castro. Under the agreement, he will not stand trial, sparing the women the trauma of testifying about their abuse by Castro over about a decade.

The women vanished without a trace between 2002 and 2004 in the same neighborhood where Castro lived, and were rescued on May 6, 11 years after the first of them disappeared.

Many Americans were alternately elated by their rescue and stunned by the details of his brutal treatment of the women, in one of the most sensational recent U.S. criminal cases. The women were bound in chains or ropes for periods of time and endured starvation, beatings and sexual assaults, according to court documents and a police report.

On May 6, neighbors heard cries for help from Amanda Berry, 27, and helped her break open a door to Castro's house, where they also found Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32, upstairs. Knight leapt into the arms of a policeman when she saw him.

Also rescued was Berry's 6-year-old daughter, who was fathered by Castro while he held the women captive, DNA evidence later confirmed. A police report said Berry had given birth to the girl in a plastic swimming pool on Christmas Day with Knight's help.

At Friday's hearing, Castro, clad in an orange prison jumpsuit, wearing glasses and with a heavy beard, spoke for the first time in detail about his actions. He said he had been a victim himself as a child and had struggled with a sexual obsession.

"My addiction to pornography and my sexual problem has really taken a toll on my mind," Castro, 53, told the judge in a clear voice.

"I was also a victim as a child and it just kept going."

Castro did not say he was sorry or express regret for his actions during the hearing. None of Castro's family or the victims attended the hearing.

"He is a fraud and a coward," Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty told reporters after the hearing. "Do not be fooled. He is a manipulator and has no remorse."

McGinty said the house where the women were confined would be torn down using money seized from Castro by authorities.

His victims said after the hearing that they were relieved Castro will be behind bars for the rest of his life and added that they wanted to maintain their privacy.

"Amanda, Gina, and Michelle are relieved by today's plea," they said in a statement released by the law firm Jones Day. "They are satisfied by this resolution to the case."

BOARDED UP WINDOWS

Castro's neighbors said he occasionally was seen taking the little girl to a nearby playground, but the women never left the house except to enter the yard on one or two occasions.

The fortress-like home had boarded up windows, multiple locks, and a basement with chains and dog leashes. Castro's family members were warned never to go past the kitchen of the house.

Police initially detained Castro's two brothers, Onil and Pedro, on suspicion of aiding in Ariel Castro's crimes. But they were quickly released and said they had no knowledge of his double life.

Castro was a bus driver for the Cleveland school district for years, driving children as young as preschool to various schools in the city, until he was fired in 2012 after a fourth disciplinary incident.

He had several other brushes with the law over the years but never serious enough for police to arrest him.

Castro told Cuyahoga County Judge Michael Russo on Friday he understood he would never emerge from prison under the plea agreement.

"I do understand that. I knew I was pretty much going to get the book thrown at me," Castro said.

Castro pleaded guilty to 937 of the 977 counts against him, including kidnapping of the three women and the young girl, and serial rape of the women.

The full sentence is life without parole, plus 1,000 years. The formal sentencing proceeding is scheduled for August 1. McGinty said the victims will participate in the sentencing hearing, although it was not clear if they would attend in person.

They have not spoken publicly in person about their ordeal. After their release they reunited with family and friends and have communicated through lawyers and a video.

Castro also had been charged with murder under an Ohio fetal homicide law. Prosecutors accused him of beating and starving Knight while she was pregnant so she would have a miscarriage.

Prosecutors could have sought the death penalty for the murder charge, but the plea agreement precluded that.

time employer.

Ingrid Lederhaas-Okun, 46, a former vice president of product development, pleaded guilty to a count of interstate transportation of stolen property less than a month after she was arrested in connection with the theft.

Among the items were bracelets, earrings and pendants made of diamonds, platinum and gold.

Under a plea agreement, Lederhaas-Okun, a resident of Connecticut, has agreed to forfeit more than $2.11 million and pay $2.24 million in restitution.

Prosecutors said she had been allowed to check out jewelry from Tiffany for reasons that included showing items to potential manufacturers for cost production estimates.

Rather than bringing the jewelry back, Lederhaas-Okun allegedly would report the items missing or damaged. Prosecutors said Lederhaas-Okun subsequently sold some, if not all, of the items to a jewelry reseller.

After Lederhaas-Okun left the company in February in a downsizing, Tiffany took inventory and found she checked out 165 pieces that had not been returned, according to the complaint filed at the time of her arrest.

While Tiffany conducts daily inventories of items worth more than $25,000, the complaint said each piece was worth under $10,000.

Court documents don't name Tiffany, instead calling it a "international jewelry company based in midtown Manhattan."

But a spokeswoman for the luxury New York store had confirmed at the time of Lederhaas-Okun's arrest on July 2, that it was the one cited in court papers. Tiffany declined comment Friday.

U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan set sentencing for December 10. Federal sentencing guidelines would place her sentence at 37 to 46 months.

Two of the three women found dead in a Cleveland suburb last week were strangled using some type of ligature, a method identical to that used by previously convicted Cleveland serial killer Anthony Sowell, county officials said Friday.

The man accused of the murders, Michael Madison, 35, of East Cleveland, mentioned the name of Sowell during a police interview and may have been inspired by Sowell, according to East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton.

The discovery last week of the three decomposed bodies wrapped in plastic were reminiscent of a 2009 incident, in which 11 bodies were found in and around Sowell's home.

Victims Shirellda Terry, 18, and Angela Deskins, 38, were both strangled, according to Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner Thomas Gilson. The cause of death of the third victim, Shetisha Sheeley, 28, is as yet unknown.

Terry's was the first body found wrapped in plastic bags in a garage of an apartment building last week after residents complained of a pungent odor. The two other bodies were found on Saturday.

Madison was formally charged on Monday with three counts of kidnapping and three counts of aggravated murder and is being held on $6 million bond. East Cleveland is a mostly low-income suburb of about 27,000 people, located just outside Cleveland.

The bodies, two of which were found by cadaver dogs, were located in a garage, the basement of a building and in a overgrown lot nearby and were estimated to have been in these locations for about six to 10 days.

Texas will seek the death penalty against a former justice of the peace accused of killing of three people, including two local prosecutors, in shootings that spawned conspiracy theories and terrified a small community near Dallas.

Eric Williams and his wife, Kim, are accused in the deaths of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, at their home in March.

They are also accused of gunning down Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse near a county courthouse in January.

McLelland and Hasse had prosecuted Eric Williams for the theft of office computer monitors.

Eric and Kim Williams both face capital murder charges. Eric Williams is also charged with making a terroristic threat, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

Prosecutors said on Friday they will pursue the death penalty against Eric Williams, but remain undecided on whether they will take similar actions against Kim Williams.

Dressed in a suit, Eric Williams sat quietly in the courtroom during the hearing that was just down the hall from where he had once presided as a justice of the peace.

His wife has told police she drove the getaway car in the Hasse killing at the courthouse and was a passenger in the car when her husband shot the McLellands, according to arrest records.

Eric Williams lost his license to practice law last year after the two prosecutors were able to convict him of theft. Kim Williams has filed for divorce.

Jury selection is expected to begin next spring and trial in October 2014, according to Dallas County District Court Judge Michael Snipes, who was named to preside over the case in Kaufman County, about 30 miles southeast of Dallas.

Bill Wirskye and Toby Shook of Dallas have been named as special prosecutors in the case.



headline: Father of fracking George P. Mitchell dies at 94
byline: By Anna Driver
8:31am EDT

George Phydias Mitchell, a petroleum engineer who transformed the natural gas industry by using hydraulic fracturing to pull the fuel out of shale formations, died of natural causes at the age of 94 on Friday.

A native of Galveston, Texas, who rose from modest means to become a billionaire philanthropist, he was the chairman and chief executive officer of Mitchell Energy &amp; Development Corp, which was sold to Devon Energy Corp for $3.5 billion in 2002.

His death was announced on the website of his foundation.

Born in 1919, he rose to become a successful wildcatter - a person who drills exploratory wells in areas not known to hold oil - after being raised by a father he described as a hardscrabble gambler and small-time entrepreneur. His parents were Greek immigrants.

Mitchell drilled for natural gas in a rock formation known as the Barnett Shale in north Texas where the first successful application of hydraulic fracturing, also referred to as fracking, resulted in the viable production of natural gas.

Fracking, in which sand, water and other fluids are blasted into rock formations at high pressure to unlock trapped oil and gas, has vastly changed the U.S. energy supply outlook. The rapid growth in crude production from shale has led to some to predict North America could be energy independent by the end of this decade. The practice has drawn criticism from environmentalists who fear the chemicals used to crack the rock can harm the environment.

Mitchell worked on the technology for 17 years and suffered numerous setbacks before it became commercially viable when he was nearly 80.

"George Mitchell was a true visionary and a pioneer," said Larry Nichols, the executive chairman of Devon Energy and a friend of Mitchell's. "He leaves a legacy that is spreading worldwide - one that for decades to come will be known as the shale revolution."

Mike Yeager, the former CEO of BHP Billiton Petroleum said all of the oil and gas from shale now being produced in the United States "comes from the work of George Mitchell."

Mitchell, a veteran of World War II, was also a real estate developer.

In 1974 he created the Woodlands, a 25,000-acre forested community filled with parks and a 1.4 mile long manmade canal, located about 30 miles north of Houston.

The Woodlands now has a population of more than 100,000 and is home to corporations including Anadarko Petroleum Corp. The world's largest publicly traded oil company, Exxon Mobil Corp, is building a 385-acre campus in the area to accommodate 10,000 employees.

Mitchell, whose wealth was estimated at $2 billion by Forbes, supported a number of causes ranging from the arts to educational initiatives and worked to promote the sustainability of natural gas through his Texas-based foundation.

He raised 10 children with his wife Cynthia Woods Mitchell who died in 2009. In 2011, Mitchell signed the Giving Pledge sponsored by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates, making public his intent that the majority of wealth should be donated to charitable causes.

profile diplomatic bargaining chip.

Bae was sentenced in early May to 15 years of hard labor after North Korean authorities convicted him of what it said was an attempt at state subversion. Authorities there said the 44-year-old used his tourism business to form groups to overthrow the government.

Bae has been held since November, and his sentencing came amid acrimonious relations between Pyongyang and Washington over the reclusive state's nuclear aspirations.

"He is asking us directly and saying, 'My health is failing, I need help.' ... There is a new note of desperation," Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told Seattle NBC-affiliate King5 in an interview aired on Thursday.

Chung in the interview said she has received a batch of handwritten letters postmarked from Pyongyang in June from Bae, who suffers from diabetes, which may be causing blindness.

Bae, looking thinner, appeared in an edited interview aired on CNN in early July wearing a dirty, blue-gray prison uniform, and he asked U.S. officials for help securing freedom and asked North Korean officials for forgiveness.

"Please don't lose hope," Chung said she has written in e-mail exchanges brokered by the State Department.

Bae is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in South Korea. He most recently lived in China.

North Korea has in the past used the release of high-profile American prisoners as a means of garnering a form of prestige or acceptance, rather than economic gain, portraying visiting dignitaries as paying homage to the country and its leader.

That pattern has complicated the response from U.S. lawmakers and the State Department, which has called for Bae's immediate release on "humanitarian grounds" but resisted sending high-profile envoys to negotiate, as it has done in the past.

"The more public action, the more government attention there is raises the value as a prisoner for Bae," said a Congressional aide familiar with diplomatic efforts, who declined to be named.

An Internet petition urging U.S. President Barack Obama to secure "Special Amnesty" for Bae has garnered roughly 4,000 signatures, and Bae's family plans a prayer vigil in Seattle on August 6. g



headline: Scouts' U.S. plantation sale nets $2.2 million for cash-strapped group

A historic Southern plantation in the United States sold for $2.2 million at auction Friday, giving some financial relief to the strapped local Girl Scout council that has owned and used it as a camp for girls for almost five decades.

The camp in South Carolina is one of dozens of Girl Scout camps in 28 states that have closed, been sold or are for sale as chapters across the United States face financial struggles, according to Save Our Scout Camps, a group fighting efforts to sell camps in Iowa and Illinois.

Friday's sale of Camp Low Country, about 35 miles from Charleston will let the Girl Scout council meet its financial obligations to Girl Scouts USA and keep its charter, said Loretta Graham, chief executive officer of Girl Scouts of Eastern South Carolina.

"We plan to keep Girl Scouting in South Carolina for 100 more years," she said.

Charleston businessman Michael Bennett, a hotel and resort developer and contractor with Bennett Hospitality and Bennett Hofford Construction Company, made the winning offer among about a dozen interested bidders in an auction on the plantation grounds.

Camp Low Country sits on 152 acres of the former Richmond Plantation, a sprawling 18th- and 19th-century rice plantation.

Shuttered since 2011 for budgetary reasons, the property includes an old-brick manor house, guest houses, stables, carriage houses and dog kennels built in 1927 by New Yorker George A. Ellis, a founder of E.F. Hutton and Co., and his wife, a chewing gum heiress.

The property was on the market for two years at an initial price of $7 million, but its value was appraised at $3.7 million before the local council announced the auction on July 1.

Camp Low Country, where scouts took part in activities ranging from horse riding to learning crafts, is just the latest to fall in the wake of a broad "realignment" by Girls Scouts USA, the national governing body of Girls Scouts councils.

The realignment that took full effect in 2009 consolidated local councils. It reduced their number by two-thirds, eliminated staff jobs and set new Girl Scout priorities for building leadership skills.

Girls Scouts has about 2.3 million youth and about 800,000 adult members nationwide, said Michelle Tompkins, spokeswoman for the New York-based Girl Scouts USA.

The organization is struggling with plummeting membership, a dearth of adult volunteers, declining cookie sales and a pension fund that is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.

In March, Congress introduced pension relief legislation for Girls Scouts USA and similar nonprofit organizations.

Critics fear Girl Scouts, which celebrated its 100th birthday in 2012, is abandoning its traditional mission of giving girls outdoor experiences. Opponents of the camp sales have sued local Girl Scout councils in several states.

The Girl Scouts' new leadership programs focus on science, technology, engineering and math, financial literacy, and even bully prevention.



headline: Tennessee victims in U.S. meningitis outbreak win new avenue for lawsuits
byline: By Tim McLaughlin
8:31am EDT

Victims in Tennessee of a deadly U.S. meningitis outbreak won the right to pursue a new avenue of litigation against healthcare facilities and doctors there, after a ruling by a U.S. bankruptcy judge this week.

Tennessee was the second hardest-hit state, behind Michigan, in a meningitis outbreak that has injured or killed more than 700 people nationwide. There were about 65 healthcare facilities and doctors in Tennessee on the customer list of New England Compounding Center, which U.S. authorities said made and shipped the fungus-tainted steroid cited in the deadly outbreak.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Henry J. Boroff on Wednesday declared NECC insolvent, clearing the way for meningitis victims from Tennessee to file product-liability claims against medical providers, health clinics and other sellers of the tainted product.

Without the insolvency declaration, meningitis victims in Tennessee would only have been able to pursue professional or medical negligence claims, according to Tennessee law.

Framingham, Massachusetts-based NECC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December.

The winning motion was filed by lawyers representing Bertram Walker Bryant Jr., a Tennessee man whose wife died from a steroid injection she received at a medical center in Nashville.

Overall, there have been 15 deaths and 153 meningitis-related cases in Tennessee, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Michigan has had 17 deaths and 264 total cases.

Before the judge's ruling, Paul D. Moore, the trustee in the NECC bankruptcy case, opposed the motion, saying it could open "the floodgates to third-party litigation."

The ruling allows plaintiffs to bring product-liability claims via the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict litigation, where a number of meningitis-related lawsuits are being consolidated.



headline: Rapper's force-feeding video riles U.S. medics at Guantanamo Bay
byline: By Jane Sutton
8:31am EDT

striking prisoners say they're not impressed.

"It's ridiculous. It's 100 percent false," said a Navy nurse known as "Ensign Lodowick" at the detainee hospital where real names are protected for security reasons.

The New York rapper-actor who also goes by the name Yasiin Bey released the video earlier this month in collaboration with Reprieve, a London-based prisoners' rights group that represents several Guantanamo hunger strikers and which describes the force-feedings as painful, humiliating and a violation of medical ethics. (<a href="http://link.reuters.com/daz89t">link.reuters.com/daz89t</a>)

Journalists are not allowed to speak to any of the 166 captives held at the U.S. naval base in eastern Cuba nor to watch as nurses insert feeding tubes into the noses and down into the stomachs of hunger strikers who receive liquid nutrients while strapped into feeding chairs.

In accounts relayed through their lawyers, the prisoners have described rough treatment and excruciating pain.

feed are calm, accepting and eager to get on with what has become a daily routine.

"Most are asking us to hurry up, make it go faster," said Lieutenant Junior Grade "Lucentio," a Navy nurse. Most of the nametags on the staff's camouflage uniforms are pseudonyms drawn from Shakespearean plays.

Some detainees drink the liquid meals, usually Ensure, directly from the can, the medics said. All of them eat some regular food some of the time, but in small enough quantities to maintain their status as hunger strikers and continue their protest against open-ended detention at Guantanamo, where most have been held for 11 years without charge.

"It's a method of communication," said Petty Officer 2nd Class Bradley, a Navy corpsman.

HUNGER STRIKE 5 MONTHS OLD

Sixty-eight prisoners are currently taking part in a hunger strike that began in February, down from 106 at the peak earlier this month. Forty-four are receiving tube-feedings, which begin when they drop to 85 percent of their ideal body weight.

Numerous medical groups have called it an ethical violation to force-feed mentally competent adults who refuse food, but U.S. courts have declined to intervene to prevent it.

The hunger strike has tapered off with a pardon for disciplinary infractions during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and a partial return to communal housing that allows some prisoners to pray and celebrate the end of the daytime religious fast together. It's unclear whether the limited truce will outlast Ramadan, which ends on August 7.

Advocates for closure of the detention facility argue that holding prisoners for years without charge or trial is a stain on the United States. They say Guantanamo is a threat to national security because it is a powerful recruiting tool for militants.

In the Reprieve video, which has been viewed more than 5 million times in two weeks on YouTube, the rapper wears an orange jumpsuit and writhes in pain as someone attempts to insert a feeding tube into his nose. He wiggles out of a head restraint, but gives up the effort before the tube reaches his stomach, and cries.

In reality, the medics said, detainees are strapped down at the legs, waist and hands by guards, but their heads are not restrained. The slender, flexible feeding tubes are lubricated with olive oil or a pain-numbing lidocaine gel and some of the prisoners help out by swallowing them down into place. None has vomited or cried, the medics said.

Army Sergeant 1st Class Vernon Branson, a watch commander at one of the prisons, said one of his fellow guards underwent a tube-feeding to see what it was like.

"My soldier took it like a champ. He was laughing and talking the whole time," Branson said.

Branson said he used to be a Mos Def fan but the video changed that. "I deleted his music off my iPod. I was a little upset about it," he said.

The nurses said the tube-feeding procedure at Guantanamo is identical to that they have used on sailors and their families at military hospitals in the United States when patients can't take solids due to illness.

Mos Def's re-enactment was done "by the book, according to the military's standard operating procedure," said Clive Stafford Smith, the British lawyer and director of Reprieve.

"We didn't do it nearly as badly as the prisoners say it's being done to them," he told Reuters.

The medics said they are fulfilling a professional duty to preserve life.

"I'm a nurse. I didn't join the military to shoot people. I joined to save people," said "Leonato," the senior medical officer at the detainee hospital.

The medics say they don't believe that any of their patients really want to starve to death and they won't discuss the politics that keep them at Guantanamo.

They dismiss Mos Def as an actor playing a role but resent his depiction of their work.

"Nobody wants a tube in the nose but sometimes it's necessary," Lucentio said. "It's kind of disheartening to have our job skewed as monsters."



headline: U.S. appeals court upholds $105 million Exxon payout in NYC case
byline: By Mica Rosenberg
8:31am EDT

A U.S. appeals court on Friday upheld a ruling against Exxon Mobil Corp ordering the company to pay $105 million in damages for polluting New York City's groundwater with a toxic gasoline additive.

The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a 2009 jury verdict that found Exxon contaminated water supply wells when methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) leaked from its underground storage tanks in the borough of Queens.

The appeals court rejected Exxon's arguments that it was required to use the additive under the federal Clean Air Act. Exxon said it would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

An oxygen-containing substance that is added to gasoline to promote more complete combustion and reduce air pollution, MTBE was one of several additives recommended by regulators to reduce emissions.

It has now largely been phased out of the U.S. fuel supply because of the danger to groundwater.

"MTBE has not been used for seven years," said Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler. "Cleanup successfully continues."

New York City claimed Exxon went ahead and used the chemical in the 1980s through the first half of the 2000s despite warnings from its own scientists and engineers that it could be harmful in areas that relied on groundwater for drinking.

MTBE has been identified as an animal carcinogen and a possible human carcinogen and causes water to smell foul and taste bad.

"Yet again, this company, which carelessly polluted our groundwater supply, has been put in its place by a court," New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement. "This should be a warning to any company whose actions threaten New Yorkers' health and quality of life."

The water wells in southeast Queens that were contaminated serve as a backup supply for the city's drinking water when the reservoirs upstate go offline because of repairs or droughts.

The city is planning to install and upgrade treatment stations to remove the MTBE to ensure the drinking water meets the same standards as the upstate system, the New York City Law Department said in a statement.

"What's at issue here isn't just the choice to use MTBE, it's the failure to warn people and the failure to take the steps that ... would have avoided or mitigated the environmental impacts of it," said attorney Victor Sher of the San Francisco-based law firm of Sher Leff that represented the City of New York.

Judges in the Second Circuit said the 11-week New York trial in 2009 was meant to serve as a bellwether case to provide guidance for other MTBE complaints that have been brought around the country.

In April, a New Hampshire jury ruled that Exxon would have to pay $236 million for MTBE contamination of drinking water in the state. The company said at the time it had strong arguments for an appeal.

Other major oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC and Chevron Corp, previously settled MTBE claims with the city for a total of $15 million, the law department said.



headline: U.S. court rejects firm's challenge to Obamacare contraception mandate
byline: By Jonathan Stempel
8:31am EDT

based challenge to the 2010 healthcare law's requirement that larger companies provide workers with health insurance covering birth control.

The decision created a split among federal appeals courts, boosting the chance that the U.S. Supreme Court may step in to resolve the dispute over challenges to the provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled against Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp, whose owners are Mennonite Christians, in finding that "for-profit, secular corporations cannot engage in religious exercise."

The decision departed from a June 27 ruling by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver favoring the arts and crafts retailer Hobby Lobby Stores Inc, in which it said for-profit companies can sometimes assert religious rights.

Lawyers for Conestoga did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The East Earl, Pennsylvania, company, which employs 950 people and is owned by the Hahn family, said the contraception mandate violated its rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).

After a lower court refused to issue an injunction, Conestoga appealed, and its lawyer told the 3rd Circuit that the company was complying with the law during its appeal. Failure to comply subjects companies with 50 or more employees to daily fines that can grow quickly.

NO SIMILAR HISTORY

Like the 10th Circuit, the 3rd Circuit reviewed the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that gave companies a broad First Amendment right to engage in political spending through independent campaign groups.

But Circuit Judge Robert Cowen, writing for the 3rd Circuit majority, said that while there was "a long history of protecting corporations' rights to free speech," there was no similar history of protection for the free exercise of religion.

"We simply cannot understand how a for-profit, secular corporation - apart from its owners - can exercise religion," he wrote. "A holding to the contrary ... would eviscerate the fundamental principle that a corporation is a legally distinct entity from its owners."

Noting that the 10th Circuit said such corporations may raise some free exercise of religion and RFRA claims, Cowen said, "We respectfully disagree with that court's analysis."

Circuit Judge Kent Jordan dissented, saying the majority decision reflected a "cramped and confused understanding" of religious rights granted by Congress and the U.S. Constitution.

"Government should be enjoined from telling sincere believers in the sanctity of life to put their consciences aside and support other people's reproductive choices," he wrote.

The Supreme Court hears oral arguments in about 75 to 80 cases per year. Typically, more than half involve issues where lower courts are divided.

The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit law firm that has argued against the contraception mandate, has said there are about 63 lawsuits nationwide challenging the mandate.

The case is Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp et al v. Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-1144.



headline: Snowden's father criticizes Congress, Obama over spy programs
byline: By Susan Heavey and Tabassum Zakaria
8:31am EDT

The father of fugitive U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden on Friday criticized Congress for failing to rein in a sweeping surveillance program made public by his son and accused the Obama administration of pursuing him with a "zeal to punish."

Lonnie Snowden has not had direct communication with his son since he fled to Hong Kong and then Russia, but sent a letter to President Barack Obama on Friday defending his son's actions as similar to acts of civil disobedience.

"We thus find your administration's zeal to punish Mr. Snowden's discharge of civic duty to protect democratic processes and to safeguard liberty to be unconscionable and indefensible," the letter to Obama said.

"We are also appalled at your administration's scorn for due process, the rule of law, fairness, and the presumption of innocence as regards Edward," he wrote in the letter posted on MSNBC's website.

Lonnie Snowden, in an interview with NBC's "Today" show, said lawmakers were "complicit or negligent" in allowing the National Security Agency's massive electronic surveillance program to continue.

"I am extremely disappointed and angry," he said. "The American people - at this point, they don't know the full truth, but the truth is coming."

NBC polling showed that more than half of Americans are worried about the vast operation that sweeps up information on phone calls, emails and other communications, but just 11 percent support Edward Snowden's decision to flee the United States and release details about the effort to the media.

Lonnie Snowden said those findings show "a concerted effort" by lawmakers and Obama "to demonize my son, to focus the issue on my son, and not to talk about the fact that they had a responsibility to ensure that these programs were constitutional."

The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday narrowly rejected a plan to limit the NSA's ability to collect electronic information, including phone call records.

About half of Americans support the data collection program while about 44 percent do not, according to a Pew Research Center poll released on Friday.

'JUST LAUGHABLE'

Edward Snowden was working at the National Security Agency as a contractor from Booz Allen Hamilton before he released details about the spying programs to U.S. and British media that were published in early June.

Russia has so far refused to hand over Snowden, who has remained in a Moscow airport since June 23, to the United States, and is considering a temporary asylum request.

On Friday Russia said its officials and the FBI were discussing the matter, and the U.S. Department of Justice said it had assured Russian counterparts that Snowden would not be tortured or face the death penalty if he was returned.

"Wow that's a real concession, they won't torture him and send him to the guillotine," Bruce Fein, Lonnie Snowden's lawyer, told Reuters, adding that such assurances were "just laughable."

He also said he had not received a response from the Justice Department over an earlier letter outlining possible conditions for his client to return to the United States.

Lonnie Snowden told NBC he was confident in his son's actions.

"I believe that my son, when he takes his final breath whether it's today or 100 years from now, he will be comfortable with what he did because he did what he knew was right."

headline: U.S. intends to send two Guantanamo detainees to Algeria
byline: By Jeff Mason and Patricia Zengerle
8:31am EDT

The Obama administration said on Friday it plans to repatriate two inmates to Algeria from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, resuming the transfer of detainees from the controversial prison for the first time in nearly a year.

The step is the latest by President Barack Obama's administration to show his commitment to closing the prison, which has held dozens of prisoners - most without charge - for more than a decade.

Obama promised to do away with the facility during his 2008 presidential campaign, citing its damage to the U.S. reputation around the world, but he has been unable to do so in 4 1/2 years in office.

Congress put tough restrictions on detainee transfers in January 2011. The administration considers the rules too onerous but had not attempted to use its ability to pursue case-by-case waivers even though 86 of the 166 men still held at Guantanamo were cleared for release years ago.

But some members of Congress, mostly his fellow Democrats but also some influential Republicans, have been pushing Obama to make good on his pledge to close the base, which he reiterated in a major national security speech this spring.

A hunger strike that has involved a majority of the inmates - and daily force-feeding of dozens - has fueled the calls to shut the detention center. This week lawmakers blasted its cost, about $2.7 million per prisoner per year, compared with $70,000 per inmate at maximum-security federal prisons.

Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a leading advocate for resuming transfers, ending the force-feeding and closing the prison, renewed her call to send home the 84 others cleared to leave.

"It is in the national security interests of the United States to transfer these detainees to their home countries rather than keep them at our isolated military base in Cuba," she said in a statement supporting the two transfers.

Administration officials declined to provide personal information about the two Algerians being sent to their home country or discuss diplomatic arrangements.

'INTENSIVE REVIEW'

"Over the past few months, a very senior interagency team conducted an intensive review of this matter," Pentagon spokesman George Little said. "Based on their recommendations, and as mandated by Congress, (Defense) Secretary (Chuck) Hagel signed off on the legal requirements to move forward with the transfer of these detainees."

Hagel backs Obama's desire to close Guantanamo.

William Lietzau, the top Pentagon official who deals with detainees, said this week he was leaving his post, according to a copy of his farewell note to colleagues obtained by Reuters.

A transfer decision is only made after a receiving country provides assurances it will take measures to mitigate threats posed by the individual and provide him with humane treatment.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the transfer was being carried out in a manner that protects U.S. national security.

"We continue to call on Congress to join us in supporting these efforts by lifting the current restrictions that significantly limit our ability to transfer detainees out of Guantanamo, even those who have been approved for transfer," he said in a statement.

The announcement came ahead of a trip to Washington next week by Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that will include a visit with Obama at the White House and a trip to Capitol Hill. Roughly 90 of those locked up at Guantanamo are from Yemen, where al Qaeda has a dangerous presence.

The United States began repatriating Yemeni prisoners after Obama's election in 2008 but halted the practice in 2010 after a man trained by militants in Yemen attempted to bomb a U.S.-bound plane in 2009 with a bomb concealed in his underwear.

Washington could decide to resume transfers to Yemen if it finds that its new government has taken adequate measures against al Qaeda and made the country stable.

The Yemeni government says it wants the detainees and is building a facility to hold them for rehabilitation.

But stiff opposition remains. Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte, like McCain a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she opposed the transfers.

"Rather than releasing detainees who could potentially return to the battlefield, the administration should focus on developing a coherent policy for the long-term detention of foreign terrorists - something it has failed to do after four and a half years," she said.

The White House said the transfer of the Algerian detainees was possible under current, "highly restrictive" U.S. law. The transfer would happen when all necessary conditions were met in Algeria, spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

The last prisoner transferred out of Guantanamo was Omar Khadr, the youngest inmate and last Westerner held at the base. He was sent in September to finish his sentence in his native Canada.



headline: San Diego mayor to enter therapy over sex scandal, won't quit
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

week leave of absence to undergo intensive therapy.

A day after the San Diego County Democratic Central Committee urged him to step down, the 70-year-old Democrat and former congressman said he would enter a counseling clinic on August 5, while keeping an eye on the affairs of California's second largest city.

"The behavior I have engaged in over many years is wrong," Filner told a news conference. "My failure to respect women and the intimidating conduct I engaged in at times is inexcusable. It has undermined what I have spent my entire professional life working on - fighting for equality and justice for all people."

Seven women have publicly accused Filner of groping and making other unwanted sexual advances toward them, including four who came forward in a group interview aired late Thursday on public television station KPBS.

Among them were retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Veronica "Ronnie" Froman and Joyce Gattas, dean of the College of Professional Studies and Fine arts at San Diego State University.

Their TV appearance came as the county Democratic Central Committee, a council of local party bosses and elected officials, voted 34-6 to approve a non-binding resolution demanding that Filner leave office.

The committee said in a statement on Friday that it stood by its position that Filner should go. But some experts said the mayor seemed determined to try to hang on to his job at almost all costs.

"He's not only hunkered down in the bunker, he's taken the hinges off the door and welded it shut," said Carl Luna, a political science professor at San Diego Mesa College.

During his two-week leave, Filner said he would be in counseling at the clinic full-time but would be briefed on city activities every morning and evening until his planned return to regular duties on August 19.

"I must become a better person, and my hope is that by becoming a better person, I put myself in a position to someday be forgiven," he added. He began his remarks by offering apologies to his staff and San Diego's citizens, adding, "Most of all, I apologize to the women that I have offended."

RESIGNATION DEMANDS

Filner spoke from his office at City Hall just 30 minutes after organizers of a recall effort held their own news conference to highlight their campaign and to present a letter to the mayor's office demanding his resignation by 5 p.m.

Numerous prominent local Democrats already had called for Filner to step down. One of them, Todd Gloria, who is president of the City Council and would become interim mayor if Filner were to resign, said his latest move to address the issue did not go far enough.

"Filner's announcement prolongs the pain when San Diegans are calling for an end to this civic nightmare," Gloria said in a Twitter message.

During her weekly news conference in Washington on Thursday, U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Filner should seek private counseling and compared his behavior to the conduct of another ex-congressman engulfed in a sex scandal since he turned to mayoral politics - Democrat Anthony Weiner of New York.

Weiner faces calls to withdraw from the New York City mayor's race after admitting he sent lewd online messages to women since he resigned from Capitol Hill over such behavior two years ago.

"The conduct of some of these people that we are talking about here is reprehensible. It is so disrespectful of women. And what is really stunning about it is they don't even realize it. You know, they don't have a clue," she said.

The clamor for Filner's ouster intensified after his former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the mayor and the city on Monday, accusing him of unwanted physical contact and suggestive comments.

Jackson's lawyer, Gloria Allred, dismissed Filner's "decision to seek therapy as a ploy to stay in power and to try to gain sympathy."

"It is ridiculous to think that he needs therapy in order to understand that women deserve respect and should not be treated like pieces of meat."

On Friday, the City Attorney's Office served Filner with a subpoena in the civil suit, demanding that he submit to a deposition on August 9, about 10 days before the mayor is due to finish his therapy.

"Testifying under oath is part of due process. We expect Mayor Filner to attend absent a court order to the contrary," Assistant City Attorney Paul Cooper said.

The City Attorney's Office has said that Filner has retained a private attorney to handle his legal matters stemming the scandal, and spokesman Michael Giorgino added on Friday, "We don't see a basis for the city paying for private therapy."

Filner was elected mayor of the normally conservative-leaning city last year after a 20-year career in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Republicans, for whom his current troubles pose a chance to seize back the city's top-elected post, have called for his resignation since allegations against him first surfaced on July 11, even before any of the alleged victims went public.

"Two weeks of therapy will not end decades of bad behavior," Republican City Councilman Kevin Faulconer said. "He needs to resign and seek long-term treatment as a private citizen."



headline: U.S. rests case after painting Boston mobster as cold-blooded killer
byline: By Daniel Lovering

hearted killer and a government snitch before wrapping up more than six weeks of testimony on Friday.

Once the most feared criminal in Boston's underworld, Bulger, 83, faces life in prison if convicted on charges related to 19 murders he is accused of committing or ordering as boss of the Winter Hill Gang in the 1970s and 80s.

Prosecutors put some of Bulger's closest partners in crime on the stand. They recalled an era when gun-toting gangsters dumped bodies under bridges or buried them in earthen basements and exchanged information with corrupt FBI agents in a bloody struggle for money and power.

Confessed killers like John 'The Executioner' Martorano, Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi, and Kevin Weeks vividly described Bulger strangling women, gunning down rivals and "rats" who talked too much, and demanding money at gunpoint from other criminals or local business owners.

"Prosecutors have an old saying, if you want to convict the devil you have to go to hell to find the witnesses," said Michael Kendall, a partner at the Boston law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery and a former federal prosecutor who investigated some of Bulger's associates. "That is literally true in this case."

Bulger's defense lawyers have said he is not guilty, and are poised to sow doubt about the witnesses, many of whom were neck-deep in crime themselves and may be seeking reduced sentences.

His attorneys plan to call a handful of witnesses starting on Monday, but they have not made clear whether Bulger, whose story inspired Martin Scorsese's Academy Award-winning film "The Departed," will take the stand himself.

Bulger fled Boston after a 1994 tip from a corrupt FBI official and spent 16 years as a fugitive before law enforcement caught him hiding out in a seaside apartment in California in 2011, with a stash of money and guns.

Scott Garriola, a special agent with the FBI in Los Angeles, testified on Friday that the ageing criminal swore at the arresting agents when they confronted him and refused their demands he kneel down "because there was grease on the ground."

INNOCENT VICTIMS

The trial took an alarming turn last week, when the body of alleged Bulger extortion victim Stephen Rakes was found in a Boston suburb. Police are still investigating the cause of his death, though a lawyer for Rakes' family said he did not believe the death was linked to the trial.

Some of the most riveting testimony came from Bulger crony and long-time friend Stephen Flemmi, who is serving a life sentence for 10 murders he confessed to a decade ago in a plea deal that spared him execution.

Wearing prison-issue khakis and a green jacket and shirt, Flemmi coldly told the jury he watched Bulger strangle his girlfriend and his stepdaughter in separate incidents in the 1980s, both because Bulger feared they were talking too much.

"It didn't take long, she was a fragile woman," Flemmi said on the 1985 killing of Deborah Hussey, his step-daughter. He said Bulger took a nap after killing the woman, while Flemmi buried her in the basement.

Kevin Weeks, another high-ranking Winter Hill gang member, told stories that painted Bulger as a friend who reveled in killing like a movie villain. During a 1982 driveby murder, he said, Bulger wore a wig and a fake mustache and drove a car capable of sending out a smokescreen or oil slick.

The target of that killing was Brian Halloran, a gang associate suspected of talking to the FBI. The other victim, Michael Donahue, was simply giving Halloran a ride.

Another Bulger associate John Martorano nonchalantly described a dozen murders that involved Bulger, from successful hits on rivals to the accidental shooting of a teenage girl.

Former drug dealers and bookies also told of harrowing meetings in which they said Bulger stuck guns in their faces and demanded huge payouts, and one case in which Winter Hill facilitated an arms shipment to the Irish Republican Army.

The trial has exposed the dark underbelly of Boston's FBI during the days of Winter Hill, when corrupt agents invited gangsters for home-cooked meals and gave them tips that helped them evade arrest.

Retired Agent John Morris said the FBI's relationship with Bulger and Flemmi also involved the pair giving them information about the Italian mob - testimony that led Bulger to swear at him and call him a liar. Bulger has adamantly denied providing any information to law enforcement officials.

headline: U.S. appeals court rejects states' challenge over climate rules
byline: By Lawrence Hurley
8:31am EDT

A federal appeals court on Friday rejected a legal challenge by Texas and Wyoming to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in a 2-1 vote, said the states and various industry groups did not have standing to sue because they could not show that they had suffered an injury or that a ruling throwing out the EPA plan would benefit them.

The decision comes after the same court upheld the EPA's first wave of greenhouse gas regulations in 2012, and is another win for the EPA, which has a strong track record in the courts in challenges to its rules, particularly those targeting greenhouse gas emissions.

"The states and industry groups trying to block EPA from curbing carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act are on a long losing streak," said David Doniger, climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Friday's decision concerned a challenge to the EPA's efforts to make states include carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases when they issue permits to industrial facilities setting limits on various types of pollution they emit.

Under the Clean Air Act, states have a cooperative relationship with the EPA in regulating air pollution.

Texas and Wyoming objected in part to the tight deadlines the EPA imposed on them for coming up with new regulations to include greenhouse gases. The agency said in December 2010 that it would have to intervene, effectively taking over the issuing of greenhouse gas permits in the affected states, because the states had failed to act.

Texas in particular regularly fights the EPA over regulatory actions. Greg Abbott, the Republican attorney general now running for governor, has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration and the EPA.

In Friday's decision, Judge Judith Rogers said the states had failed to show how voiding the rules in question would "redress their purported injuries."

Without the states updating their permitting programs, "construction of a major emitting facility could not proceed," Rogers said, adding that the Clean Air Act is clear that states have to issue permits "for each pollutant subject to regulation under the act."

STATES COULD DRAG HEELS

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality called the ruling "disappointing" and said it will consider future action.

"The EPA has effectively re-written the Clean Air Act to impose its new standards, imposed severely restrictive timelines on the states to implement its new requirements, and then twisted the Act to immediately impose its agenda on Texas," TCEQ Chairman Bryan Shaw said in an emailed statement.

In a landmark 2007 ruling, the Supreme Court said carbon dioxide was a pollutant that could be regulated under the Clean Air Act.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion to the latest case, saying states should have been able to use their old regulatory schemes, which do not take into account greenhouse gases, until they had time to update them.

In other notable rulings in recent years, the Supreme Court has upheld the EPA's authority to use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in two high-profile cases, while the D.C. Circuit has turned away at least four challenges.

Frank O'Donnell, president of the non-profit group Clean Air Watch, said Friday's ruling strengthens the hand of the EPA as it starts to implement President Barack Obama's climate action plan. Obama in June directed the agency to write rules to curb carbon emissions from the country's fleet of existing power plants.

But O'Donnell said Texas and other states opposed to federal environmental regulations are likely to drag their heels when forced to comply with EPA timelines.

"I predict they will be late filing their plans, due in 2016 under the scenario the president set forth, and will dare the federal government to intervene," O'Donnell said.

Texas has sued the EPA many times, most recently in a bid to challenge a practice in which environmental groups sue the agency to force it to issue or speed up regulations.



headline: Life in prison plea deal for man who held Cleveland women for years
byline: By Kim Palmer
8:31am EDT

A former Cleveland school bus driver, Ariel Castro, on Friday pleaded guilty to hundreds of charges of kidnapping and raping three women he held captive and will serve life in prison, the culmination of one of the most sensational criminal cases in the United States in recent years.

At a court hearing, Ohio prosecutors in turn agreed that Castro would not be eligible for the death penalty. The agreement means Castro will not stand trial, sparing the women the trauma of testifying about their abuse by Castro over about a decade.

The women vanished without trace in the same neighborhood where Castro lived between 2002 and 2004 and were rescued on May 6, 11 years after the first of them disappeared.

Many Americans were alternately elated by their rescue, and stunned by the details which later emerged of his brutal treatment of the women. They had been bound for periods of time in chains or ropes and endured starvation, beatings and sexual assaults, according to court documents and a police report.

On May 6, neighbors heard cries for help from Amanda Berry, 27, and assisted her in breaking open a door to Castro's house, where they also found Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32, upstairs. Knight leapt into the arms of a policeman when she saw him.

Also rescued was Berry's 6-year-old daughter, who was fathered by Castro while he held the women captive, DNA evidence later confirmed. A police report said that Berry had given birth to the girl in a plastic swimming pool on Christmas Day with Knight's help.

At Friday's hearing, Castro spoke for the first time in detail about his actions, saying he had been a victim himself as a child and had struggled with a sexual obsession.

"My addiction to pornography and my sexual problem has really taken a toll on my mind," Castro, 53, clad in an orange prison jumpsuit, wearing glasses and with a heavy beard, told the judge in a clear voice.

"I was also a victim as a child and it just kept going."

None of Castro's family or the victims, attended the hearing. There was no immediate comment from the victims.

BOARDED UP WINDOWS

Neighbors of Castro said he occasionally was seen taking the little girl to a nearby playground, but the women never left the house except on one or two occasions to the yard.

The fortress-like home had boarded up windows, multiple locks, and a basement with chains and dog leashes. Castro's family were warned never to go past the kitchen of the house.

Police initially detained Castro's two brothers, Onil and Pedro, on suspicion of aiding in Ariel Castro's crimes. But they were quickly released and said they had no knowledge of his double life.

Castro was a bus driver for the Cleveland school district for years, driving children as young as preschool to various schools in the city, until he was fired in 2012 after a fourth disciplinary incident.

He had several other brushes with the law over the years but never serious enough that police arrested him.

Castro told Cuyahoga County Judge Michael Russo on Friday that he understood he would never emerge from prison under the plea agreement.

"I do understand that. I knew I was pretty much going to get the book thrown at me," Castro said.

Castro pleaded guilty to 937 counts of the 977 charges against him, including kidnapping of the three women and the young girl, and serial rape of the women.

The full sentence is life without parole, plus 1,000 years. The formal sentencing proceeding is scheduled for August 1.

Castro also had been charged with murder under an Ohio fetal homicide law. Prosecutors accused him of beating and starving Knight while she was pregnant so she would have a miscarriage.

Prosecutors could have sought the death penalty for the murder charge but the plea agreement precludes that.



headline: Obamacare's foot soldiers train to enroll the masses
byline: By Sharon Bernstein
8:31am EDT

Nahla Kayali is a foot soldier for Obamacare.

She is among the first wave of 2,000 community organizers in California getting trained to persuade more than 1 million uninsured people in the state to sign up for subsidized health coverage under President Barack Obama's reform law.

Kayali and her cohorts begin their mission next month, armed with flyers, pamphlets and a small army of volunteers who speak 13 languages.

"We're getting consumers and small businesses the tools to enroll, and trying to eliminate the barriers to enrolling," said Kayali, 55, who runs a non-profit that provides social services to Arab Christians and Muslims in Orange County, just south of Los Angeles. "We're going to break down the stigma - any barrier, whether it's a language barrier or a cultural barrier."

Among U.S. states, California will have the largest force deployed in a massive national outreach effort costing hundreds of millions of dollars. These thousands of foot soldiers will have to promote the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the face of widespread political opposition and public skepticism.

Their work is key to the success of the new law in its first year, when the Obama administration seeks to enroll as many as 7 million people, including 2.7 million young and healthy people who are cheaper to insure, for 2014.

Oregon and Vermont have already begun training their enrollment advisers, while Connecticut and Washington are just starting up and other states, including Illinois and New York, will commence later this summer.

The playbook for these ambassadors focuses on two main points: First, tell people how they will benefit from Obamacare; second, stay away from divisive political talk.

"There is a major effort ... to try to educate Americans," said Michael Sparer, head of American health policy and management at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. "There are extraordinary levels of confusion over what the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, does and does not do."

Opponents of the health reform law have criticized the public funds spent on mobilizing tens of thousands of people like Kayali into what they say is a highly politicized campaign. Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, says it may not work despite the expense.

"They're trying to sell millions of people something that they've already shown they don't want … and they're trying to do it in a very confused and politically polarized atmosphere," he said. "They don't realize what they've got themselves into."

A CONCERN FOR EVERY COMMUNITY

The outreach advisers will counsel Americans on what kind of coverage they need, what kind of subsidies they may qualify for and how to sign up. Some are paid through federal grants or by private organizations, while others are volunteers. Hospital staff, already schooled in helping uninsured patients determine whether they are eligible for government programs like Medicaid, are expected to lend a hand.

California is spending $140 million on enrolling consumers and small business owners for the state's new healthcare exchange, including $86 million worth of advertising time, said Dana Howard, a spokesman for the Covered California exchange.

The ad campaign will roll out during the fall, Howard said, so the information is fresh in consumers' minds as enrollment begins in October. Along with television, newspaper and website ads, it will include social media campaigns on Facebook, Google+ and Twitter, he said.

When they hit the streets, however, they may meet considerable obstacles, from the political to the personal.

Kayali expects to find resistance from Arab immigrants who fear government assistance could make them vulnerable to corrupt politicians - as they might have been in their home countries.

"They're afraid it might affect their legality, and they are afraid the government will want something from them in return," she said.

It was to learn how to deal with such skepticism - among other obstacles - that Kayali and several hundred other non-profit administrators sat in a medical center training office in a Los Angeles suburb last week.

"Never make any political representation in any presentation," trainer Laquetta Shamblee told the group. "We don't make political statements even if we have a political opinion."

JUST THE FACTS

Shamblee also admonished trainees to keep their groups' political materials - on immigration, Middle East policy or other issues - away from events where they promote the Affordable Care Act, along with any statements about the law or Obama.

"Everybody has a cell phone, and we don't want to be on '60 Minutes,'" she said.

Shamblee, who has a background in healthcare advocacy, said the state is not offering trainees lessons in how to counter potential opponents who might approach them at schools, churches or other places they set up tables. They are being advised not to engage in potentially inflammatory talk at all, but simply provide factual information about how to get health insurance through the exchange.

"Once people get the details, if it's something that benefits their families they will look into it," she said.

In Los Angeles County, Tina Wong will field a team of Spanish-speaking ambassadors going door-to-door to offer information to Latino consumers.

Like Kayali, she expects to find resistance: In Los Angeles County, 11 percent of the adult population is undocumented - ineligible to purchase insurance from the exchange and at risk of deportation if their status becomes known. That may prevent many families from signing up - even if some loved ones, including U.S.-born children, are eligible.

"Our biggest obstacle will be fear among parents who are undocumented to enroll their children," said Wong.

She is acutely aware of how divided American families may be about the law, as her husband, a Republican, staunchly opposes Obamacare and believes that the uninsured should not rely on the government for health coverage.



headline: Obese former death row inmate dies in Ohio
byline: By Kim Palmer
8:31am EDT

A convicted Ohio killer who sought to be spared the death penalty because he was obese died Thursday at a Columbus hospital of natural causes, an Ohio prison spokeswoman said.

Ronald Post, 53, who weighed more than 450 pounds, had been scheduled to be executed by lethal injection last January for the aggravated murder in 1983 of motel desk clerk Helen Vantz during a robbery.

The execution was commuted to life in prison by Ohio Governor John Kasich last December, following a recommendation by a parole board panel. The panel had found numerous omissions, missed opportunities and questionable decisions by defense attorneys.

Post had previously appealed unsuccessfully to stop his execution on grounds his extreme weight created a substantial risk that he would have a "torturous and lingering death" if executed by lethal injection.

Post died of undisclosed causes Thursday morning at Franklin Medical Center, Ricky Seyfang, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said on Friday. Seyfang said Post's death was "medically expected."

Post had been sentenced to death by a three-judge panel in 1985 for Vantz's murder after entering a plea of no-contest.

Post's lawyers argued that previous counsel should not have advised him to enter a no contest plea without assurances he would not face the death penalty.

Post told the clemency board he never confessed to killing Vantz, as prosecutors portrayed, and had only confessed to driving a man who he said committed the crime to the motel and waiting in a vehicle outside.



headline: U.S. assures Russia Snowden won't be executed or tortured
byline: By Darya Korsunskaya and David Ingram
8:31am EDT

The United States has made a formal promise to Russia not to execute or torture Edward Snowden if he is sent home to face charges of illegally disclosing government secrets, and the Kremlin said Russian and U.S. security agencies are in talks over his fate.

The 30-year-old former U.S. spy agency contractor has been stuck in the transit area of a Moscow airport for more than a month despite Washington's calls to hand him over.

Russia has refused to extradite Snowden, who leaked details of a secret U.S. surveillance program including phone and Internet data, and is now considering his request for a temporary asylum.

In a letter dated Tuesday July 23 and released on Friday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder wrote that he sought to dispel claims about what would happen to Snowden if he is sent home.

"Mr. Snowden has filed papers seeking temporary asylum in Russia on the grounds that if he were returned to the United States, he would be tortured and would face the death penalty. These claims are entirely without merit," Holder wrote.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia's FSB and its U.S. counterpart, the FBI, were in talks over Snowden, whose stay at the Moscow Sheremetyevo airport has further strained Moscow-Washington ties.

Russian President Vladimir Putin had expressed "strong determination", he said, not to let relations suffer over the dispute "no matter how the situation develops". Putin himself is not personally dealing with the problem, the spokesman said.

But he reiterated Moscow's stance that Russia "did not hand over, does not hand over and will not hand over anybody".

Putin, a former KGB spy, has said Snowden could only be granted sanctuary in Russia if he stopped actions that could harm the United States.

A U.S. law enforcement official following the case confirmed the FBI has been in discussions with the FSB about Snowden for some time now but added he was not aware of any recent breakthroughs or imminent developments stemming from that.

A Russian security expert said the talks may be about how to secure a promise from Snowden to stop leaking if he were granted sanctuary in Russia.

"The United States maybe understands that they are not going to get Snowden, so my theory is that they are trying to save face and stop Snowden from publishing new exposes," Andrei Soldatov said, adding that he was skeptical this could be done.

ASYLUM OFFERS

Snowden's supporters have worried he could face the same fate as Private First Class Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier on trial for providing documents to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group. On his arrest, Manning was placed in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day with guards checking on him every few minutes.

"Torture is unlawful in the United States," Holder wrote, without explicit reference to Manning. "If he returns to the United States, Mr. Snowden would promptly be brought before a civilian court."

Snowden has been offered asylum by three Latin American countries but none of them is reachable directly on commercial flights from Moscow, where he flew in from Hong Kong on June 23. He has also had his passport revoked by the United States.

His hopes for leaving the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone, which Russia insists is formally not its territory, were dashed at the last minute on Wednesday, prompting a wave of speculation about possible political intervention or a hitch.

A Russian lawyer assisting Snowden in his asylum request, Anatoly Kucherena, who also sits on an advisory group to the Russian authorities, said his client feared he could face torture or the death penalty if returned to the United States.

Russia's federal migration service has up to three months to consider Snowden's temporary asylum request filed on July 16. An official was quoted on Friday as saying that could be extended to six months.

Snowden is a convenient propaganda tool for the Kremlin, which often accuses the United States of preaching abroad what it does not practice at home on human rights.

But Moscow has also held Snowden at arm's length as Putin wants U.S. President Barack Obama to come to a bilateral summit in Moscow before a G20 meeting in St. Petersburg in September.

The White House has left it vague on whether Obama will come to the face-to-face talks.

A U.S. Senate panel voted unanimously on Thursday to seek trade or other sanctions against Russia or any other country that offers asylum to Snowden.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday narrowly rejected a plan to limit the National Security Agency's ability to collect electronic information, including phone call records.

Snowden's father on Friday blasted U.S. lawmakers for not reining in the electronic spy program made public by his son, accusing them of being "complicit or negligent."

Bruce Fein, an attorney for Snowden's father Lonnie, said he had not yet received a response from Holder to a letter he sent to the attorney general suggesting developing "parameters for a fair trial" for Edward Snowden. Fein said Lonnie Snowden had not had any direct communication with his son since April.

byline: By Madeline Chambers
8:31am EDT

Germany's president, who helped expose the workings of East Germany's dreaded Stasi secret police, said whistleblowers like U.S. fugitive Edward Snowden deserved respect for defending freedom.

Weighing in on a debate that could influence September's federal election, President Joachim Gauck struck a very different tone from that of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has assured Washington that Berlin would not shelter Snowden.

Gauck, who has little power but great moral authority, said people who work for the state were entitled to act according to their conscience, as institutions sometimes depart from the law.

"This will normally only be put right if information is made public. Whoever draws the public's attention to it and acts out of conscience deserves respect," he told Friday's Passauer Neue Presse newspaper.

After the fall of communism, Gauck, a dissident Lutheran pastor, headed a commission in charge of the Stasi's vast archive of files on people it had spied on, using them to root out former Stasi members and collaborators.

His unusual decision to speak out on a hot political issue comes as the fallout from the Snowden affair is dominating headlines in the run-up to the September 22 election where Merkel - who, like Gauck, comes from what was communist East Germany - hopes to win a third term.

"The fear that our telephones or mails are recorded and stored by foreign intelligence services is a constraint on the feeling of freedom and then the danger grows that freedom itself is damaged," he said.

"We are a democratic state with the rule of law with basic rights. Freedom is one of these basic rights."

Merkel has been at pains to maintain friendly relations with Washington at the same time as showing voters she understands their anger about reports of intrusive surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency's (NSA), where Snowden worked as a contractor.

She has repeatedly said the state has a duty to protect its citizens from the threat of terrorism, but that the response must be proportionate.

Opposition parties have accused Merkel of failing to press Washington for answers about the scale of NSA activity.

Reports that German spies cooperated with U.S. agents caused an outcry and one crucial question is how much she or her chief of staff knew. So far she has offered few answers.

The issue has potential to damage Merkel in the election, although opinion polls show little impact so far on a double-digit lead for her conservatives over the main opposition Social Democrats (SPD).

Referring to communism and Nazism, Gauck said Germany had painful experiences of living in a security state where no one was safe to speak out:

"We Germans have had to experience the abuse of state power with secret services twice in our history. And therefore we are sensitive (to this) and our American friends must accept that."



headline: Opposition mounts to Summers as possible Fed chief
byline: By Pedro da Costa and Mark Felsenthal
8:31am EDT

former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.

The outcry has come not from Republicans, but the left wing of the Democratic Party. Summers advised Obama, was treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton, led Harvard University and was chief economist for the World Bank. He helped tame the Asian financial crisis that threatened to sweep the globe under Clinton.

But liberals blame him for spearheading financial deregulation that they charge helped create the financial crisis, and say his work at hedge fund D.E. Shaw makes him the epitome of a revolving door between Wall Street and government.

A representative for Summers, who writes an opinion column for Reuters, declined to comment for this article, as did the White House and the Fed.

Some powerful Democrats, including former Treasury Secretary and one-time Citigroup executive Robert Rubin, have been speaking up behind the scenes for Summers, according to multiple sources with close ties to the Fed or the White House.

If Obama tapped Summers, he would be picking him over the Fed's current vice chair, Janet Yellen, who is seen as the other main candidate for the job.

Both Yellen and Summers would be expected to hew fairly close to the policy course set by Bernanke.

Supporters of Summers argue he should have an edge given his crisis-management experience.

"When there is consensus, who the Fed chair is hardly matters, and the times when it matters are the times when you have to think outside the box, and then his strengths shine," said Brad DeLong, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who worked with Summers in the Clinton Treasury Department.

According to aides, Senate Democrats who oppose him have penned a letter urging Obama to choose Yellen, who has been a major force in the Fed's efforts to stimulate a sluggish U.S. recovery using unconventional monetary policies. Yellen would be the first woman to head the central bank.

Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio was circulating the letter, the aides said. It was unclear how many senators had signed it, but several Democrats have already spoken out in favor of Yellen and against Summers.

"I am for Janet Yellen. I am taking that position," Democratic Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa told Reuters.

A spokeswoman for Brown did not respond to emails requesting comment, and a Fed spokeswoman said Yellen declined to comment.

Bernanke's second four-year term at the helm of the central bank expires on January 31, 2014. While he has not discussed his plans, it is widely expected he will step down.

Some critics of Summers wonder why Obama might turn down a woman for a man who has been accused of sexism. As president of Harvard, Summers sparked a firestorm by suggesting intrinsic aptitude might explain why relatively fewer women reach top academic positions in math and science - comments for which he later apologized.

"The president's track record of appointing women is mediocre at best," Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group, said in a note to clients. "So there's a brilliant female candidate to replace Ben Bernanke; she's highly respected within the Fed - and Obama is going to appoint someone who will never live down his comments that women lack the qualifications for some university jobs?"

CONCERNS ON REGULATION

When he served as Treasury chief under Clinton, Summers helped clinch the law that revoked the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment banking activities from those of commercial, deposit-taking institutions.

That opened the gate for commercial banks to get involved in riskier financial products, such as the credit default swaps that were at the heart of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Moveon.org, a liberal group that provided major support to both Obama presidential campaigns, is circulating a petition entitled: "Don't let Larry Summers head the Fed," which accuses him of laying the groundwork for the deep U.S. recession.

Senate Banking Committee member Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, told Reuters he would find a nomination of Summers "disconcerting."

"Many questions need to be asked and answered related to his philosophy of regulation and deregulation," he said.

LEANING TOWARD SUMMERS?

A person with close ties to the Obama administration said he had reason to believe the president was closely considering Summers, and perhaps even leaning toward him. The source said Obama would likely view Summers' ties to Wall Street and crisis-management experience as important attributes.

At the same time, sources familiar with thinking inside the Fed say staff and some members of the central bank's board are concerned Summers' often blunt manner could be a detriment in shaping policy at the consensus-driven central bank.

Those sources requested anonymity given the sensitive nature of the personnel discussions.

Yellen has been the runaway favorite to replace Bernanke in media polls of financial market participants, but analysts say Summers has the advantage of a close relationship with Obama.

He also has powerful supporters.

"His allies have been ginning up support, making it clear that he's interested - and that's the kiss of death. If you want a major job in this town, you have to be coy," Valliere said.

A person familiar with the nomination process said Obama had yet to make a decision. An announcement is not expected until the autumn.

Alabama executed a convicted murderer on Thursday who prisoners' rights groups said was mentally ill.

Andrew Reid Lackey, 29, was put to death by lethal injection at Holman Prison in Atmore, Alabama, prison officials said. It was the state's first execution since 2011.

Lackey was convicted of killing Charlie Newman, an 80-year-old World War Two veteran in Athens, Alabama.

Lackey made no statement before his execution, according to prison officials. He was pronounced dead at 6:25 p.m. CDT (2325 GMT).

Newman's grandson had told Lackey that his grandfather had a vault filled with gold bars, according to court documents.

On a 911 recording from Newman's home, the veteran's last words were, "Come sit down and let me pray for you." He was trying to calm Lackey, who was a close friend of his grandson, according to court records.

On the recording, Lackey could be heard asking for the location of the vault.

The Equal Justice Initiative, a Montgomery-based prisoners' rights group, argued that Lackey was mentally ill and had attempted suicide. He "lives in Andrew land," and takes multiple psychotropic drugs, the group said in a statement before the execution.

Even though he had not exhausted his legal appeals, according to court records, Lackey wrote to the Alabama Supreme Court last year requesting that his death sentence be carried out.

The prisoners' rights group went to court to stop the execution. It argued that the judge should have properly evaluated Lackey's mental competency before permitting him to waive his appeals, but an appeals court allowed the judge's ruling to stand.

Bryan Stevenson, the Equal Justice Initiative's director, said on Thursday that a family member had intervened on Lackey's behalf to expedite the execution.



headline: Accused Cleveland abductor to appear in court amid reports of plea deal
byline: By Kim Palmer
8:31am EDT

Accused Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro is scheduled to appear in court on Friday amid reports that he is close to agreeing to a plea deal under which he would serve a life sentence for kidnapping and raping three women and holding them captive for years.

Several media reported on Thursday that prosecutors had offered Castro a deal to avoid a trial, and spare him the death penalty.

Under the offer, Castro, 53, would spend the rest of his life behind bars plus 1,000 years, without the possibility of parole, NBC news reported late on Thursday, citing sources involved in the investigation.

Several other Cleveland media reported a deal was imminent.

Earlier on Thursday, Castro defense lawyer Jaye Schlachet told Reuters a plea agreement had not yet been reached.

Jay Frolik, a spokesman for prosecutors, on Thursday declined comment on reports of a possible deal.

Cuyahoga County Judge Michael Russo set a 10 a.m. EDT Friday court hearing and said the parties "had entered into plea negotiations on this case."

Castro has been charged with 977 counts, including kidnapping and rape, for the abduction and imprisonment of Gina DeJesus, 23, Michelle Knight, 32, and Amanda Berry, 27.

The women disappeared beginning in 2002 and were freed from Castro's home in a rundown area of Cleveland on May 6. Also freed was a 6-year-old girl who, according to DNA evidence, was fathered by Castro with Berry during her captivity.

The women had been bound for periods of time in chains or ropes and endured starvation, beatings and sexual assaults, according to court documents and a police report. Avoiding a trial would spare them from having to testify.

He has also been charged with murder under a fetal homicide law for allegedly forcing one of the women to miscarry.

Under Ohio law, prosecutors could seek the death penalty for the murder charge and said they were considering it.

If no plea agreement is reached, Castro's trial is scheduled to begin on August 5. Prosecutors have said they would be ready for trial but Castro's defense team argued they would not have enough time to review a huge amount of evidence.



headline: Massive California wildfire sparked by faulty electrical gear
byline: By Steve Gorman
8:31am EDT

old forest fire that had threatened the scenic mountain resort of Idyllwild in Southern California before cooler, rainy weather helped crews largely subdue the blaze, fire authorities said on Thursday.

The so-called Mountain Fire charred 27,000 acres in mountains near Palm Springs, forcing the evacuation of several communities and destroying seven homes.

The blaze, which was first reported on July 15, was 92 percent contained by Thursday evening, authorities said, as crews worked to mop up hot spots.

The faulty equipment that led to the fire was on private property, on a customer's side of an electrical meter, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.

The agency said investigators were still trying to learn more details about how the fire started.

About 3,400 firefighters worked for more than a week against the fierce blaze, which roared through dry brush and timber in the rugged San Jacinto mountain range.

The blaze, which ranked for several days as federal fire managers' top priority among 17 large wildfires across several western states, erupted in the San Bernardino National Forest, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles.

The San Jacinto range overlooks Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage and several smaller desert towns to the northeast, but the main threat was to the village of Idyllwild, a popular vacation destination in the mountains.

The mile-high community, known for its hiking trails, rock climbing and arts and music scene, was ordered evacuated last week, along with the neighboring town of Fern Valley and surrounding parks and campgrounds as flames advanced.

Authorities estimated that some 6,000 residents, campers and other seasonal visitors had been chased out by the fire.

The famed Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, a rotating gondola that carries visitors from the desert floor to an observation post near the San Jacinto peak, was also closed when the fire was raging last week.

Experts say this year could bring one of the worst U.S. fire seasons ever. In recent weeks, a Colorado wildfire ranked as that state's most destructive on record ravaged more than 500 homes and killed two people. In Arizona, 19 members of an elite "hotshot" crew died while battling a fire on June 30.

The Mississippi Supreme Court has ruled that death row inmate Willie Jerome Manning can ask a lower court judge to allow DNA and fingerprint testing in a bid to overturn his conviction for murdering two college students.

The ruling came more than two months after the same court stopped Manning's execution on May 7, hours before it was scheduled to take place.

The order, dated Tuesday, also reverses an earlier decision in which the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against Manning's request for DNA testing.

His case is one of as many as 27 death penalty cases included in a unprecedented review by the U.S. Justice Department of old criminal cases in which convictions may have been influenced by erroneous forensic evidence.

In their request for DNA testing, Manning's attorneys said technological advancements since his trial could lead to proof through DNA evidence that he is innocent of killing two Mississippi State University students in 1992.

Manning has 60 days as of July 23 to ask Judge Lee J. Howard to grant DNA and fingerprint testing in Oktibbeha County Circuit Court.

Mississippi Innocence Project Director Tucker Carrington, whose organization aided in Manning's appeals, said he was relieved the Mississippi Supreme Court stopped short of denying post-conviction DNA testing for a death row inmate.

"I feel like Mississippi stepped back from the precipice, regardless of the results ... by allowing the testing and avoiding becoming one of a few if not the first state ever to ignore ... the probative value of post-conviction DNA evidence," Carrington said.

The bodies of Jon Steckler, 19, and Tiffany Miller, 22, were found in rural Oktibbeha County. Manning was convicted in 1994 and sentenced to death.



headline: Juror says Zimmerman 'got away with murder'

A juror in the trial of George Zimmerman says the former neighborhood watch volunteer "got away with murder" when he was acquitted earlier this month in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.

The woman, who is part Hispanic and was identified in court as juror B29, said she would have liked to convict Zimmerman of murdering Martin but her hands were tied by a lack of evidence.

"You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty," she said in an interview due to be aired on ABC's "Good Morning America" on Friday. "But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence," the woman said.

Excerpts of the interview were published on ABC's website, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-juror-murder/story?id=19770659.&lt;/p&gt;"></a>

Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, responded to the interview excerpts in a statement on Thursday evening.

"It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from juror B29, comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true: that George Zimmerman literally got away with murder," Fulton said.

Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter on July 13 after a racially charged trial. The verdict triggered demonstrations across the United States.

The jurors have remained anonymous under a judge's order. Juror B29 allowed her face to be shown and used her first name, Maddy. ABC said the 36-year-old woman is Puerto Rican and that she recently moved to Florida from Chicago. She is a nursing assistant and mother of eight.

Juror B29, the only non-white member of the jury, is the second juror to speak in a televised interview, and the first to show her face.

Juror B37, a mother of two who grew up in a military family, appeared last week on CNN with her face obscured. She said she believed Zimmerman, 29, was "justified" in shooting Martin, 17, during a confrontation in a gated community in central Florida in February 2012.

She said she did not think Zimmerman racially profiled Martin and believed Martin attacked Zimmerman first.

INITIALLY FAVORED CONVICTION

Shortly after the interview, which prompted a hostile backlash on social media, CNN said four other jurors released a statement distancing themselves from B37's comments.

Juror B29 agreed with B37 that the case was never about race, despite accusations by the prosecution that Zimmerman had profiled Martin when he called police to report someone acting suspiciously in the community near Orlando.

Zimmerman's lawyers said he acted in self-defense after Martin started beating his head against a concrete sidewalk.

Whatever the truth, juror B29 said Zimmerman had a lot to answer for. "George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with," she said. "(But) the law couldn't prove it."

When the jury began deliberations, she said she initially favored convicting Zimmerman. "I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury. I fought to the end," she said.

On the second day of deliberations she realized there was not enough proof to convict Zimmerman of murder or manslaughter under Florida law, she said.

When asked whether the case should have gone to trial, the juror said: "I don't think so." She added: "I felt like this was a publicity stunt."

She said that after the trial had ended, she wrestled with her decision and had a hard time sleeping and eating. She said she feels she owes Martin's parents an apology.

"I'm hurting as much as Trayvon Martin's mother because there's no way that any mother should feel that pain," she said.

headline: After massacre, Connecticut town to design new Sandy Hook school

Newtown, Connecticut took another step this week toward replacing the Sandy Hook Elementary School, where a gunman in December killed 26 people including 20 young children, the town's top elected official said on Thursday.

Fearing that a return to the school would further traumatize the remaining students, the town has decided to raze the existing building. Planning and design for the new Sandy Hook school will be funded with a $750,000 grant from the state, said First Selectman Patricia Llorda.

"This was the first of two crucial steps in getting a new school built and it was a tremendous show of support by the community," Llorda said of a meeting late Wednesday where more than 150 people -- about ten times many people as usually attend town meetings -- crowded into the municipal chambers and unanimously approved the plan.

The town has scheduled a public referendum for October 5 where voters will approve or knock down a plan to spend an additional $50 million remaining from the state grant.

Students, faculty and staff who survived the rampage have been moved to another school building in a neighboring town.

The existing school, where 19-year-old Adam Lanza carried out his attack, will not be demolished until the final vote on the spending, Llorda said.

Llodra said Sandy Hook School students will continue to attend Chalk Hill School in neighboring Monroe until June 2016. She said she expects the new school in Sandy Hook to open that September.

School Board member John Vouros, a retired Newtown teacher, welcomed the news.

"Having taught here for 35 years, this was very important to me personally and to the entire school community and town," Vouros said. "This shows the town is moving forward ... and this is a giant step."

The body of a man that former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez is accused of murdering last month was found with the keys to a black Chevrolet Suburban that Hernandez had rented, according to court papers released on Thursday.

The victim, semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, was discovered on June 17 in an industrial area not far from Hernandez' North Attleborough home. His cell phone contained messages exchanged with Hernandez the night of Lloyd's death.

Authorities on Thursday released about 100 pages of heavily redacted search warrants and affidavits related to their investigation of Lloyd's death.

Hernandez was cut from the National Football League team on June 26, shortly after police arrested him on charges that he orchestrated the execution-style murder.

The former tight end has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts including murder and weapons charges tied to Lloyd's death last month.

Hernandez made a brief appearance in Massachusetts state court on Wednesday, when Judge Daniel O'Shea agreed to a request by prosecutors to delay until August 22 a hearing to establish probable cause in the case.

Lloyd's body, which was found about a less than a mile from Hernandez's home, had been shot five times at close range with two of the bullets passing through his body, prosecutors have said.

Prosecutors said that Hernandez soured on Lloyd, 27, a few nights before the body was found, with the two arguing after Lloyd socialized at a nightclub with people that Hernandez disliked.

Two other men have been taken into custody in connection with the case. Ernest Wallace, who is suspected of being an "accessory after the fact," turned himself in to police in Miramar, Florida, last month. Another man, Carlos Ortiz, was arrested in Connecticut on charges of being a fugitive from justice.

Hernandez, 23, had been a rising young star in the NFL who had signed a $41 million contract with one of the league's top franchises before his arrest.

Patriots Coach Bill Belichick on Wednesday made his first remarks on the case, saying that the team had been "shocked and disappointed" by the news.

The man accused of abducting and raping three women and holding them captive for years is due to appear in a Cleveland court on Friday amid media reports that an agreement is in the works that would allow him to avoid the death penalty.

TV said an agreement was imminent. But Castro's lawyer Jay Schlachet told Reuters reports that an agreement had been reached "were false".

Joe Frolik, a spokesman for Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty, said he had no comment on the reports.

Cuyahoga County court spokeswoman Laura Creed said in an email, "The parties have entered into plea negotiations on this case." She said the hearing had been scheduled for Friday at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).

Castro's lawyers have said for weeks that they would consider an agreement under which the former Cleveland school bus driver would plead guilty to some charges in return for his life.

Castro, 53, has been charged with 977 counts including kidnapping and repeated rape. He has also been charged with murder under a fetal homicide law for allegedly forcing one of the women to miscarry. The murder charge could carry the death penalty.

Gina DeJesus, 23, Michelle Knight, 32, and Amanda Berry, 27 were freed from Castro's home in a rundown area of Cleveland on May 6. Also freed was a 6-year-old girl who, according to DNA evidence, was fathered by Castro with Berry during her captivity.

The women had been bound for periods of time in chains or ropes and endured starvation, beatings and sexual assaults, according to court documents and a police report. Avoiding a trial would spare them from having to testify.

If no plea agreement is reached, Castro's trial is scheduled to begin on August 5.

headline: Los Angeles-area campgrounds closed after squirrel found with plague
byline: By Dan Whitcomb
8:31am EDT

Authorities have evacuated and shut down a section of a national forest outside Los Angeles for at least a week after a ground squirrel was found there infected with the plague, county public health officials said on Thursday.

The squirrel tested positive for plague after it was trapped in the Angeles National Forest during "routine surveillance activities," the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a written health advisory.

Health officials said that as a precaution, visitors were ordered to leave three campgrounds and a recreation area of the Angeles National Forest, which encompasses some 655,000 acres in the San Gabriel Mountains just north of metropolitan Los Angeles.

Plague, known as the "Black Death" when it was blamed for killing some 25 million Europeans during the Middle Ages, is a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas.

A health department spokesman said no people were believed to have been infected.

"It is important for the public to know that there have only been four cases of human plague in Los Angeles County residents since 1984, none of which were fatal," the health department chief, Dr. Jonathan Fielding, said in a statement.

An average of seven cases of plague are reported each year in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mostly in western states. The disease is typically not fatal if treated with antibiotics.

Officials said further testing of squirrels would be conducted in the Angeles National Forest before the Broken Blade, Twisted Arrow and Pima Loops campgrounds were re-opened to the public.

According to the health department, plague has been known to reside in the San Gabriel Mountains ground squirrel population. Previous surveillance efforts have identified five other squirrels carrying the disease since 1996.

The most recent squirrel found to be infected was trapped on July 16 during routine checks in the park and confirmed to carry the disease on July 23, according to the health advisory.

Last year, an Oregon man survived a bout with plague, one of three reported in that state since the mid-1990s, none of which were fatal.



headline: Judge approves suit tying Morgan Stanley to toxic lending in Detroit
byline: By Bernard Vaughan
8:31am EDT

A federal judge on Thursday approved a lawsuit accusing Morgan Stanley of discrimination for encouraging a subprime mortgage lender to target black homeowners in Detroit.

In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer in New York made a connection between predatory lending in the run-up to the financial crisis in 2008 and Detroit's bankruptcy petition last week.

"Detroit's recent bankruptcy filing only emphasizes the broader consequences of predatory lending and the foreclosures that inevitably result," Baer wrote in a 13-page opinion. "It is not difficult to conclude that Detroit's current predicament, at least in part, is an outgrowth of the predatory lending at issue here."

The plaintiffs include five black homeowners in Detroit who accuse the bank of discrimination for giving New Century Mortgage Company incentives to issue loans, including loans with balloon payments, that were likely to fail.

The bank did this by routinely purchasing loans unlikely to be repaid and packaging them in securities that were then sold, providing funding that helped New Century stay in business until it filed for bankruptcy in 2007, according to the plaintiffs.

"These high-risk loans as opposed to better loans or even no loan at all caused Plaintiffs a concrete injury," Baer wrote in his ruling on Thursday. "Thus, Plaintiffs have adequately pled injury in fact."

The ruling allowed the plaintiffs to move ahead with their claims under the Fair Housing Act.

However, Baer dismissed claims they had brought under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Michigan's Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act.

The plaintiffs brought the proposed class-action lawsuit with assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union in October 2012.

Laurence Schwartztol, a staff attorney in the ACLU's racial justice program, said Thursday that he was pleased with the decision.

headline: U.S. HPV vaccination rates far from goal, officials say
byline: By Yasmeen Abutaleb
8:31am EDT

term goal of 80 percent.

The vaccination rate to protect against human papillomavirus (HPV) was 53.8 percent last year for teen-age girls, just marginally higher than the 53 percent rate a year earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday.

The rate reflected girls who had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Full vaccination requires a three-dose series.

HPV is responsible for an estimated 26,000 cancers in the United States each year. About 79 million people in the country have the sexually transmitted virus, and 14 million are newly infected each year.

"We're dropping the ball," Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on a conference call with reporters. "We're missing opportunities to give HPV vaccines and that needs to change."

The CDC collected data from the National Immunization Survey-Teen, which collects vaccination data for 13-17-year-olds.

The CDC recommends routine HPV vaccination for boys and girls at age 11-12, before they are sexually active.

The CDC noted that among unvaccinated girls, 84 percent had missed the opportunity to get an HPV shot when they visited a healthcare provider for another immunization. Had they also received an HPV vaccine at that time, the percentage of girls who had received at least one dose could be as high as 93 percent.

Each year the vaccination rate remains at its current 33 percent for girls who have received all three doses, an additional 4,400 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer, according to the CDC.

HPV, which most often does not show symptoms for several years, can also cause vaginal and vulvar cancer in women and can lead to penile cancer in men. It may also lead to anal and throat cancers among men and women as well as genital warts.

HPV vaccines are sold by Merck &amp; Co, under the name Gardasil, and by GlaxoSmithKline, under the name Cervarix.

The vaccination rate for adolescent girls who received the recommended three-dose series decreased slightly in 2012 to 33.4 percent from 34.8 percent a year before.

Health officials hope to achieve an 80 percent vaccination rate within seven years, according to goals laid out in 2020's Healthy People, a set of 10-year objectives aimed at improving health in the United States.

President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, which requires almost all Americans obtain health insurance or pay a penalty beginning in 2014, could help increase the vaccination rate as uninsured families gain coverage for the shots, health officials said.

Health officials said many parents do not believe their daughters need to be vaccinated because they are not sexually active, or are afraid that receiving the vaccine will open the door to sex.

But Frieden and Thomas McInerny, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said like other vaccines, the HPV vaccine needs to be administered well before exposure to potential diseases.

For example, health officials have seen high success rates with a three-dose vaccine series for hepatitis B, a contagious liver disease. The doses for hepatitis B vaccine are typically given at birth and through the first few months of a child's life.

"We don't wait for exposure for any other vaccine," McInerny said on the call. "We recognize that the conversation about HPV can take extra time in practice."



headline: U.S. indicts hackers in biggest cyber fraud case in history
byline: By David Jones and Jim Finkle
8:31am EDT

Federal prosecutors said on Thursday they have charged five men responsible for a hacking and credit card fraud spree that cost companies more $300 million and two of the suspects are in custody, in the biggest cyber crime case filed in U.S. history.

They also disclosed a new security breach against Nasdaq, though they provided few details about the attack.

Other companies targeted by the hackers include a Visa Inc licensee, J.C. Penney Co, JetBlue Airways Corp and French retailer Carrefour SA, according to an indictment unveiled in New Jersey.

Authorities have been pursuing the hackers for years. Many of the breaches were previously reported, though it appeared the one involving Nasdaq OMX Group Inc was being disclosed for the first time.

Prosecutors said they conservatively estimate that the group of five men from Russia and Ukraine helped steal at least 160 million payment card numbers, resulting in losses in excess of $300 million.

Authorities in New Jersey charged that each of the defendants had specialized tasks: Russians Vladimir Drinkman, 32, and Alexandr Kalinin, 26, hacked into networks, while Roman Kotov, 32, mined them for data. They allegedly hid their activities using anonymous web-hosting services provided by Mikhail Rytikov, 26, of Ukraine.

Russian Dmitriy Smilianets, 29, is accused of selling the stolen data and distributing the profits. Prosecutors said he charged $10 for U.S. cards, $15 for ones from Canada and $50 for European cards, which are more expensive because they have computer chips that make them more secure.

The five hid their efforts by disabling anti-virus software of their victims and storing data on multiple hacking platforms, prosecutors said. They sold payment card numbers to resellers, who then sold them on online forums or to "cashers" who encode the numbers onto blank plastic cards.

"This type of crime is the cutting edge," said New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman. "Those who have the expertise and the inclination to break into our computer networks threaten our economic wellbeing, our privacy and our national security."

The indictment cited Albert Gonzalez as a co-conspirator. He is already serving 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to helping mastermind one of the biggest hacking fraud schemes in U.S. history, helping steal millions of credit and debit cards.

Prosecutors say the defendants worked with Gonzalez before his arrest in Miami, then continued on a crime spree after his capture.

Drinkman and Smilianets were arrested in June 2012, while traveling in the Netherlands, at the request of U.S. authorities. Smilianets was extradited last September and is expected to appear in New Jersey Federal court next week. Drinkman is awaiting an extradition hearing in the Netherlands.

Prosecutors declined comment on the whereabouts of the other three defendants.

Tom Kellermann, a vice president with security software maker Trend Micro, said he thinks the prospects are dim that they will be caught because authorities in some countries turn a blind eye to cyber criminals.

"There is an enormous shadow economy that exists in Eastern Europe. In some countries, sophisticated hackers are seen as national assets," he said.

Kalinin and Drinkman were previously charged in New Jersey as "Hacker 1" and "Hacker 2" in a 2009 indictment charging Gonzalez in connection with five breaches.

NASDAQ BREACH

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan announced two other indictments against Kalinin, one charging he hacked servers used by Nasdaq from November 2008 through October 2010. It said he installed malicious software that enabled him and others to execute commands to delete, change or steal data.

The infected servers did not include the trading platform that allows Nasdaq customers to buy and sell securities, prosecutors said. Officials with Nasdaq said they could not immediately comment.

A source with knowledge of the breach said on Thursday the indictment was not related to a 2010 attack that Nasdaq had previously disclosed, which was targeted against Directors Desk, a service used by corporate boards to share documents and communicate with executives, among other things.

The source, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter, said that hackers appear to have used their access to the firm's network to create their own landing page on a Nasdaq website, where users were directed when they wanted to change their passwords.

The second indictment filed against Kalinin in Manhattan, which was unsealed on Thursday, charged that he worked with a sixth hacker, Russian Nikolay Nasenkov, 31, to steal bank account information from thousands of customers at Citibank and PNC Bank from 2005 to 2008, resulting in the theft of millions of dollars.

MAKING PROGRESS

Mark Rasch, a former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, told Reuters that the arrests show that law enforcement is making progress in identifying those responsible for major cyber crimes.

"They involve dozens or even hundreds of people huddled over computer terminals all over the world in a common purpose of stealing of disseminating credit card numbers," said Rasch, who was not involved in bringing the case.

Among the breaches cited in the New Jersey indictment, prosecutors charged that the group was responsible for the theft of more than 130 million credit card numbers from U.S. payment processor Heartland Payment Systems Inc beginning in December 2007, resulting in approximately $200 million of losses. That was the same case for which Gonzalez was convicted and which was the largest case of its kind before the latest indictments.

Heartland released a statement praising authorities for their work: "We hope that this indictment further delivers the message that prolific hacking organizations worldwide will be pursued and charged for crimes such as this one."

The indictment charged that they took approximately 30 million payment card numbers from British payment processor Commidea Ltd in 2008 and 800,000 card numbers from Visa Inc's licensee Visa Jordan in 2011.

An attack on Global Payment Systems that begin in about January 2011 resulted in the theft of more than 950,000 cards and losses of about $93 million, according to the indictment.

It charged the ring with stealing approximately 2 million credit card numbers from French retailer Carrefour SA, beginning as early as October 2007 and said the theft of card numbers from Dexia Bank Belgium resulted in $1.7 million in losses.

Other victims included Dow Jones, Wet Seal Inc and 7-Eleven Inc, according to prosecutors.

Dow Jones said in a statement that there was "no evidence" that information of Dow Jones or Wall Street Journal customers information was compromised as a result of the breaches.

Officials with Carrefour, Global Payments and JCPenney declined comment.



headline: Prosecutors call U.S. WikiLeaks soldier 'traitor' for security breach
byline: By Medina Roshan
8:31am EDT

Military prosecutors called the U.S. soldier accused of the largest leak of classified information in the nation's history a "traitor" for releasing documents on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

As the court-martial of Army Private First Class Bradley Manning winds down, prosecutors in closing arguments on Thursday said the 25-year-old intelligence analyst had betrayed the trust his nation put in him.

"Manning had the general evil intent ... he acted voluntarily and deliberately with his disclosures," said Major Ashden Fein, the lead military prosecutor. "He was not a whistleblower. He was a traitor."

Closing statements for the prosecution lasted about five hours.

Attorneys for Manning, who faces 21 counts of leaking more than 700,000 documents through the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website, are due to make their closing remarks on Friday.

Earlier in the case, they portrayed Manning as well-meaning but naive, intending to provoke a broader debate on U.S. military and diplomatic policy by releasing the documents. The most serious charge he faces, aiding the enemy, carries a life sentence.

The case has pitted civil liberties groups who seek increased transparency into the actions of the U.S. military and security apparatus, against the government, which has argued that the low-level intelligence analyst, who was stationed in Baghdad at the time, endangered lives.

It also illustrates the perils of granting so many people access to classified information, said Joseph Wippl, a former CIA officer who is now a professor of international relations at Boston University.

"He leaked information to which at least half a million people had access. Giving access to that many is like laying a trap for lemmings," Wippl said. "It was bound to happen."

Army Colonel Denise Lind, who is presiding over the trial, early in the proceedings on Thursday denied a request by the defense to find Manning not guilty of five of the counts related to stealing information from government databases.

She also denied a request by the defense to declare a mistrial.

'AGENCY OF THE PEOPLE'

The case, which saw WikiLeaks publish classified files, combat videos and diplomatic cables, serves as a test of the limits of secrecy in the Internet age.

But it has recently been overshadowed to some degree by the case of fugitive U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden, who revealed to Britain's Guardian newspaper early last month the details of alleged secret U.S. surveillance programs tracking Americans' telephone and Internet use.

The WikiLeaks website has become controversial both for its publishing of secret data and for its founder, Julian Assange, who has been sheltering in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for more than a year to avoid extradition to Sweden for alleged sex crimes.

Fein said a search of Manning's computers showed he had done more than 100 searches related to WikiLeaks, which he called the "first intelligence agency of the people."

Manning was arrested in May 2010 while serving in Iraq.

He chose to be tried by a military judge, rather than have a panel of military jurors hear his case.

In February, Manning pleaded guilty to lesser charges, including misusing classified information, such as military databases in Iraq and Afghanistan and files pertaining to Guantanamo Bay detainees.

At that time, he read from a prepared 35-page statement in an attempt to explain why he released classified information to WikiLeaks: "I believe that if the general public ... had access to the information ... this could spark a domestic debate as to the role of the military and foreign policy in general."

The prosecution maintained that Manning sought fame, not openness.

Major Fein described a photo he said the soldier took of himself after sending documents to WikiLeaks: "This is a picture of a person who thought he'd finally become famous."

in cabana.

"He slammed the table. Then he takes a shotgun that was on the table and sticks it in my mouth," Buccheri said, his voice trembling. "He said he wanted 200... he meant $200 thousand."

Buccheri's testimony on Thursday, during the seventh week of Bulger's murder and racketeering trial, was the latest of many accounts of violence and extortion by people who dealt with the longtime leader of Boston's Winter Hill crime gang. Prosecutors are expected to finish making their case as soon as Friday.

The 83-year-old Bulger, Boston's most feared crime boss during the 1970s and '80s, has been charged in connection with 19 murders. He has pleaded not guilty, though his lawyers have admitted Bulger was a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark.

Buccheri told the jurors that when Bulger removed the shotgun from his mouth, he picked up a handgun and pressed it against the side of his head.

"He said, 'If you don't pay me in 30 days I'm going to kill you and your family,'" Buccheri said. "I agreed to pay. I got out of the screen house alive."

Bulger faces a life sentence if convicted of the charges stemming from a bygone era when machinegun-toting mobsters left a trail of unsolved killings as they fought for control of lucrative rackets including smuggling and race-fixing, killing anyone they thought might talk to authorities. Prosecutors say Bulger himself was an informant to a corrupt FBI agent who ignored his crimes as long as he informed on other criminals.

His attorneys have conceded that Bulger was an "organized criminal," but dispute the prosecution's contention that he was an informant for the FBI. Bulger insists he took information but never gave it.

The FBI listed Bulger and his main partner Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi as informants. On Thursday, Flemmi wrapped up nearly a week of testimony, disputing the suggestion by Bulger's attorneys that he has an easy life serving a life sentence in prison after confessing a decade ago to 10 murders.

"If I gave that food to my dog, he'd bite me," Flemmi said in a rare moment of comic relief.

Flemmi, the prosecution's star witness, has delivered vivid accounts of murders he said he saw Bulger commit. Defense attorneys have been trying to undercut his testimony and that of two other close associates of Bulger.

Among the murders Flemmi described were those of his own girlfriend and his stepdaughter. He said Bulger strangled both women because he believed they knew too much about the gang's dealings and risked tipping off police.

Asked by defense attorney Henry Brennan whether he expected a reduced sentence for his testimony, Flemmi said: "I don't know what the future holds ... Everybody hopes that at some point in the future something beneficial will happen to them. I'm still alive and that's the hope."

The two other associates who have testified against Bulger received shorter sentences in exchange for their cooperation with prosecutors. Flemmi drew a life sentence, but he did avoid the death penalty and kept possession of bank accounts, a laundry business, and numerous condominiums.

Bulger's story inspired the 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed," in which Jack Nicholson played a character loosely based on Bulger.

After fleeing Boston in 2004, Bulger spent 16 years in hiding, evading capture even while on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list. Agents arrested him in June 2011 in a seaside Santa Monica, California home where he lived, keeping a cache of guns and $800,000 cash.



headline: Alabama set to execute man for murder of World War Two veteran

Day paratrooper.

It will be the state's first execution since October 2011.

Andrew Reid Lackey's execution by lethal injection is scheduled for 6 p.m. local time at Holman prison in Atmore.

Lackey was sentenced to death in 2008 for the murder of Charlie Newman, a paratrooper during World War Two, who was stabbed 70 times in the small town of Athens, Alabama.

The victim's grandson had told Lackey that his grandfather had a vault filled with gold bars, according to court documents.

On a 911 recording from Newman's home, the veteran's last words were, "Come sit down and let me pray for you." He was trying to calm Lackey, who was a close friend of his grandson, according to court records.

On the recording, Lackey could be heard asking for the location of the vault.

The Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), a Montgomery-based group focusing on the rights of prisoners, argued that Lackey was mentally ill and had attempted suicide. He "lives in Andrew land," and takes multiple psychotropic drugs, the group said in a statement.

Even though he has not exhausted his legal appeals, according to court records. Lackey wrote to the Alabama Supreme Court last year requesting that his death sentence be carried out.

EJI went to court to stop the execution arguing that the judge should have properly evaluated Lackey's mental competency before permitting him to waive his appeals, but an appeals court allowed the judge's ruling to stand.

Bryan Stevenson, EJI's director, said on Thursday that a family member had intervened on Lackey's behalf to expedite the execution.

If he is put to death, Lackey will be the 21st person executed in the United States so far this year.

Former football star O.J. Simpson asked the Nevada parole board on Thursday to reduce his prison sentence of up to 33 years for his role in the robbery of two sports memorabilia dealers and said he has missed key moments with family while he was behind bars.

Simpson, convicted in 2008 of storming a Las Vegas hotel room with other men and taking thousands of dollars worth of memorabilia he said dated from his sports career, is seeking parole for convictions on robbery, kidnapping and burglary charges.

Simpson, 66, is serving consecutive sentences and would still need to finish his sentences for assault with a deadly weapon and other charges related to the 2007 incident.

The Pro Football Hall of Fame running back was dressed in prison denim when he appeared via video conference on Thursday from Lovelock Correctional Center and spoke to a parole board commissioner 100 miles away in Carson City.

A somber-looking Simpson said the sports collectors he took property from "could have it all" if he could "get these five years back" that he spent in prison.

"I missed my two younger kids, for the most part, getting through high school," Simpson said. He added that he also was unable to attend his sister's funeral.

In 1995, Simpson was acquitted in California of two counts of murder in the stabbing and slashing deaths of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. He later lost a wrongful death case brought by Goldman's family.

Even if Simpson were successful in this and future parole requests, he would not be released from prison before 2017, said David Smith, a spokesman for the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners.

The Nevada parole board will likely rule next week on Simpson's request, Smith said.

"He's been a model inmate, so we don't expect him to have any problems making parole," said Simpson's attorney, Patricia Palm, who is representing him in his request for a new trial on the charges.

Simpson told the parole commissioner he was only trying to retrieve property that he believed belonged to him.

He is eligible for parole on his convictions for robbery, kidnapping and burglary, but not assault with a deadly weapon, Smith said.

Simpson, who has gained weight and seen his hair recede and turn greyer while behind bars, said on Thursday that he has mentored young inmates and that he performs custodial duties in the gym at his prison in remote northeast Nevada.

Because of credits for good behavior, Simpson would likely serve a total of no more than about 20 years in prison even if he were never granted parole, said Clark County Chief Deputy District Attorney Leon Simon, who is involved in fighting Simpson's request for a new trial.

In May, Simpson requested a new trial on the grounds that his former attorney, Yale Galanter, mishandled the 2008 case and had a conflict of interest because he knew in advance that the former athlete planned to confront the sports dealers.

A Clark County judge is expected to rule within weeks on Simpson's request for a new trial.

headline: House panel passes bill to cut back mail delivery

door delivery to help the struggling U.S. Postal Service shave costs. But the plan faces stiff opposition in the Senate.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted 22-17, along party lines, late on Wednesday to send the bill to the full Republican-led House. But if it passes there, Democrats who lead the Senate have said they would oppose service cuts.

Most lawmakers agree Congress must do something to help the Postal Service, which lost $16 billion last year because of dwindling mail volumes and massive payments into its future retirees' health fund.

The Postal Service, which does not receive tax dollars, has said it could need a taxpayer bailout of nearly $50 billion by 2017 if it doesn't get permission from Congress to overhaul its business. The agency wants to cut $20 billion in costs by 2017.

The bill, introduced by Republican Representative Darrell Issa, the committee chairman, revives a previously defeated plan to move to five-day delivery of first-class mail to save about $2 billion annually, but continue Saturday delivery of packages and pharmaceutical drugs.

The bill would also convert all homes and business deliveries to either curbside or neighborhood clusterbox delivery. It includes a waiver for people with extreme hardship and an option to pay extra for continued door delivery.

Direct-to-door delivery costs the Postal Service about $353 per address each year. Curbside delivery costs $224, and cluster boxes cost $160 per address.

Eliminating door delivery, Issa said, would save the agency $4 billion annually. The Postal Service has already phased out direct-to-door delivery for newly built homes.

The bill also addresses the massive payments the Postal Service must make into a fund for its future retirees' healthcare. It would allow the agency to forego past due payments and postpone payments until 2015. The agency expects to default on its next installment of $5.6 billion due in September.

Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings said the bill would hurt Postal employees by intruding on negotiations between the Postal Service and the unions. The National Association of Letter Carriers said the bill would worsen the Postal Service's financial troubles by degrading service and driving customers to alternatives.

The Greeting Card Association, which supports Issa's plan for clusterbox delivery and reviewing the heavy healthcare prefunding requirement, opposes other parts of the bill such as eliminating Saturday delivery, said Rafe Morrissey, GCA's vice president of postal affairs.

The Postal Service said it would evaluate Issa's legislation and determine whether it would do enough to provide the flexibility it needs to reform its operations.



headline: Weiner defiant amid calls to quit New York mayoral race
byline: By Jonathan Allen and Edith Honan
8:31am EDT

Anthony Weiner resisted mounting calls to bow out of the New York City mayoral race on Wednesday, a day after admitting he had continued the sexually charged online chats that led him to resign from Congress in disgrace two years ago.

Weiner, who took the lead in several polls soon after announcing his political comeback in May, said in an email to supporters that he should have been clearer about how long the behavior had persisted but that he hoped voters would give him another chance.

The New York Times and the New York Daily News both published editorials on Wednesday urging Weiner, a Democrat who was once a leading liberal voice in Congress, to end his bid to follow Mayor Michael Bloomberg into City Hall.

"The serially evasive Mr. Weiner should take his marital troubles and personal compulsions out of the public eye, away from cameras, off the Web and out of the race for mayor of New York City," the New York Times wrote in its lead editorial, adding he had "disqualified himself" for public service.

Weiner told a news conference on Tuesday he had sent lewd images of himself to women online until at least last summer.

The New York Post, known for its outrageous headlines, went with "Meet Carlos Danger" - a reference to Weiner's reported pseudonym in the online chats with a woman he met over the Internet.

Weiner insisted he would not drop out. In his email, he said his campaign was about something larger than himself and that he would not "leave New Yorkers without a choice."

Of the resumption of online activity that had cost him his last job, Weiner said: "It was a terrible mistake that I unfortunately returned to during a rough time in our marriage."

Until the revelations, Weiner was ahead in the mayoral race. On Wednesday, Quinnipiac University released a poll - conducted before Weiner's news conference - that found him leading Democratic candidates with 26 percent of the vote. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn followed with 22 percent, and former City Comptroller Bill Thompson had 20 percent.

Weiner's latest troubles began on Monday after a gossip website called The Dirty published a series of sexually explicit messages and images an unnamed young woman said she received from Weiner, including pictures of his penis.

The woman was identified by CNN on Wednesday as Sydney Elaine Leathers, 23, of Evansville, Indiana. CNN interviewed an acquaintance who said she had engaged in a sexually explicit text relationship with Weiner.

Reuters was unable to independently verify the identity of the woman. She could not be reached by Reuters for comment. The acquaintance, contacted by Reuters, declined to be interviewed.

The woman gave the website numerous screenshots of what the website said were chats on Facebook and another social media website in which Weiner described the sexual acts he wanted to perform on her and which she apparently encouraged.

"You are a walking fantasy," Weiner reportedly said in one of the chat's less explicit exchanges, which took place after the two began communicating in July 2012, when the woman was 22.

Buzzfeed, a news and entertainment website, said it had identified a woman in her early 20s from Indiana as the source of the new chats.

Nik Richie, the owner of The Dirty, told Reuters in an interview that he could not confirm the woman's name. But he described her as "star struck" and said she genuinely believed she and Weiner were in love.

"They would have conversations all the time. He was like a little child. He needed validation from her all the time. They talked every day, sometimes several times a day," he said.

'HUMA FOR MAYOR'

During Tuesday's news conference, Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, stood at his side, alternately smiling and looking awkwardly away. After apologizing for her nervousness, she read out her own statement saying she had forgiven him.

To many New Yorkers, Abedin, a longtime aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, proved a sympathetic figure.

"I say Huma for mayor," Tina Brown, the editor of Newsweek, wrote on Twitter. "She has all the qualities he doesn't."

Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp owns the New York Post, called Weiner a "sicko."

"Should help city by just fading away," he wrote on Twitter.

Some voters shared the sentiment.

"I know nobody's perfect, but I don't think he's trustworthy," said Dottie Lipski, 55, a graphic designer.

Other voters said they didn't think Weiner's personal failings had anything to do with his ability to lead.

"It's two separate things. It doesn't have anything to do with his qualifications to be mayor," said Racquita McMillon, a 38-year-old merchandise analyst.

One of his rivals in the Democratic primary, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, who was in fourth place with 15 percent of the vote in the latest Quinnipiac poll, urged Weiner to withdraw. Thompson, who often appears in third place in the polls, said the news was "deeply disturbing."

Quinn, Weiner's nearest rival, stopped short of calling on Weiner to withdraw, but criticized what she described as "a pattern of reckless behavior, consistently poor judgment, and difficulty with the truth," in a statement on Wednesday.

Weiner, who has often gamely conceded that his name is ready-made for late-night comedians' jokes, was ribbed on Tuesday night by David Letterman, who suggested other pseudonyms for Weiner to consider: Carlos Dangler, Throb Reiner and Eliot Spitzer.



headline: Milwaukee County reports 27 cases of Legionnaire's disease
byline: By Mary Wisniewski
8:31am EDT

A late start to summer weather in the Upper Midwest may be linked to an outbreak of 27 cases of Legionnaire's disease in Milwaukee County since June 1 of this year, a health official said on Thursday.

The outbreak includes 19 cases of the illness, a severe form of pneumonia, among Milwaukee residents, according to the city's health department. Two other county cases are suspected.

The disease is contracted by breathing in a mist or vapor contaminated with the Legionella bacteria, which can grow in cooling towers, showers, decorative fountains and other water sources. People already in poor health, including those who smoke heavily and have chronic lung disease, are the most vulnerable.

The Milwaukee outbreak may be linked to cooling towers on large buildings, according to Paul Biedrzycki, director of disease control and environmental health for the Milwaukee Health Department. They are typically readied for hot weather in late April and early May, but were turned on later this year because warm weather arrived unusually late, he said.

The delay, which left the towers without maintenance, may have allowed for the growth of the bacteria.

"I think this is an interesting hypothesis," Biedrzycki said. He said health officials may never know for sure.

The number of illnesses is unusual - the county typically sees 24-27 cases for the entire year.

The rate of reporting in Milwaukee dropped slightly in the last week, so Biedrzycki said the area "may be out of the woods." There have been no deaths.

The illness is named for a 1976 outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia.

Three deaths were tied to a Legionnaire's outbreak in a Chicago hotel last summer. Biedrzycki said that the disease tends to be more lethal when it is from a source inside a building.



headline: Detroit Windsor Tunnel operator files for bankruptcy
byline: By Tom Hals
8:31am EDT

American Roads LLC, the privately owned operator of the international border crossing tunnel that links Detroit to Windsor, Ontario in Canada filed for bankruptcy on Thursday, citing reduced traffic.

The bankruptcy was not the result of last week's petition for bankruptcy by Detroit, although the city's problems contributed to the company's difficulties, Neal Belitsky, American Roads' chief executive, said in court documents.

American Roads is seeking to restructure $830 million in debt. Traffic volumes fell short of projections made in 2006 when it took on its debt, according to court documents.

The company, owned by infrastructure investor Alinda Capital Partners LLC, also indirectly owns four toll roads in Alabama.

American Roads said in court papers that its plan of reorganization was already approved by creditors and that it proposed August 28 as a date for the bankruptcy court in Manhattan to approve its plan.

Under the plan, Syncora Guarantee Inc will become the owner of the company upon its exit from bankruptcy. Syncora insured the company's bond and swap obligations.

American Roads said in court papers it anticipated that most of its low-priority general unsecured creditors will be paid in full.

The company blamed a decline in the population of the Detroit area for the drop in traffic through the Detroit Windsor Tunnel.

Detroit's population has fallen from a peak of 1.8 million in the middle of last century to under 700,000 today.

Detroit sought Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection last week to restructure $18 billion in retiree and bond obligations. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Detroit will consider the city's eligibility for bankruptcy next month.

Belitsky, American Roads' CEO, did not immediately return a call for comment.

The case is In Re American Roads LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-12412.

headline: Detroit area's battle with blight may be key to survival
byline: By Nick Carey
8:31am EDT

strewn and overgrown lots, there are few better places to start than in Brightmoor in the northwestern corner of the city.

"Brightmoor is arguably one of the most blighted areas in Detroit, which makes it one of the most blighted areas in the country," said Kirk Mayes, executive director of community group the Brightmoor Alliance. "If you can tackle blight in Brightmoor, you can do it anywhere."

Local non-profit, the Detroit Blight Authority, aims to do just that, with a budget of up to $500,000 to clear 14 blocks of this neighborhood and more to come once it raises more funds.

The group has hired 25 local residents, clearing an urban jungle of brush, trees and garbage to the point where occupied and abandoned homes are visible from the street and to each other. In a Detroit neighborhood like Brightmoor that is regarded as a victory.

When Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr filed last week for the city to enter into the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, he cited the need to tackle widespread blight, including many abandoned homes and other buildings, as one of Detroit's most urgent problems.

"Perhaps no issue is as fundamental to - or emblematic of - Detroit's decline as urban blight," Orr wrote in a declaration in the filing, adding "These decrepit eyesores dramatically undermine Detroit's efforts to maintain public safety (as they contribute to the proliferation of crime and arson) and contribute to declines in property values."

The rise of Detroit alongside the U.S. auto industry brought a tide of humanity to the area, making this the fastest-growing city in the world in the first three decades of the 20th century and reaching a peak population of 1.8 million mid-century. That tide ebbed as automotive jobs faded and initially white residents - and later middle-class black residents - fled to the suburbs, leaving thousands of decaying buildings and just 700,000 residents.

The city estimates it has 78,000 "abandoned and blighted" structures, roughly one fifth of Detroit's housing stock, and 38,000 are considered dangerous. This in an area of 139 square miles - big enough to fit Manhattan, Boston and San Francisco.

As part of a proposal to city creditors in June, emergency manager Orr outlined plans to spend $1.25 billion over the next decade to overhaul its police, fire and emergency services and modernize Detroit's infrastructure. The proposal also calls for $500 million to be spent on blight removal through 2019 and mentions the Detroit Blight Authority as a group the city would work with.

But given it costs the city more than $8,500 to tear down just one home, that might not be quite enough to deal with the full extent of the problem.

"If you address Detroit's blight problem, you make the rest of the city's problems easier to solve," said Brian Farkas, executive director of the Detroit Blight Authority and a former assistant attorney general for the state of Michigan.

Residents of Brightmoor, which is about 12 miles from downtown Detroit, fear that open discussions about downsizing Detroit mean they will be deprived of the few basic services they currently receive and hope the blight cleanup project will help their efforts to prove theirs is a viable community.

COCKROACHES, BE GONE

When homes are abandoned they become a magnet for crime, not least because of the dense brush and high grass that grow up around them. Drug dealing and prostitution are common, plus Detroit's contractors drive into blighted neighborhoods from outside the city to illegally dump waste they would otherwise have to pay to dispose of.

Of Detroit's 12,000 fires each year, 60 percent involve blighted and unoccupied buildings. If you live next door to one, forget about homeowner's insurance.

In clearing the brush from the 14 blocks in Brightmoor, the Detroit Blight Authority found 300 tires, tons of garbage and a dead body. Drive along streets in Brightmoor that are not part of the project and the brush is so dense you could easily hide a corpse there.

Backed by local foundations and businesses, the non-profit authority was founded by Bill Pulte, grandson of Pulte Homes founder William Pulte who built his first home in Detroit in 1950. It selected Brightmoor because 7,000 of its 23,000 residents are children, many of whom have to walk to school through the area currently being cleared.

This particular area contains 562 properties, 108 occupied houses and 71 abandoned homes have so far been identified as "candidates" for destruction. Using an approach based on the way Pulte Homes builds large numbers of homes fast, as opposed to the city's piecemeal, regulation-laden process, the group has reduced demolition costs to under $5,000 a property.

"This has been a long time coming," said Terence Gore, 25, a home remodeler who lives right in the middle of the blight removal site and has been hired to work on the project. "This area is supposed to be called Brightmoor, but it's been gloomy around here as long as I can remember."

In a pilot project earlier this year, the Detroit Blight Authority cleared a 10-block area not far from the downtown area known as Eastern Market.

Andrew Arena, formerly a Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent in charge of the Michigan area who now runs a non-profit called the Detroit Crime Commission, said that area was low on population but was a center for drug and prostitution operations before the cleanup.

"There's nothing going on there now," Arena said. "The criminals who were there are like cockroaches. If they've no place to hide they move on."

"THROWAWAY COMMUNITY"

Pittsburgh could serve as an example of what blight removal can achieve. Like Detroit, that city had begun to decline after hitting a peak population of nearly 680,000 in 1950 and that accelerated when Pittsburgh's steel industry base disintegrated in the early 1980s. In the 60 years following the city's peak, the population fell to just over 300,000.

Concerted blight removal efforts in Pittsburgh have been underway for more than two decades, with abandoned land turned into green space and parks. The city still has more than 10,000 abandoned buildings, but local groups say that is a manageable number. Home prices have ticked up an average of 3.3 percent annually over the past decade and the population rose by a few thousand from 2010 to 2012.

Ernie Hogan, executive director of the Pittsburgh Community Reinvestment Group, said the focus now is on reconstructing abandoned homes for new owners instead of demolition.

"The question now is how do we stop tearing down these assets?" he said.

In Detroit, a tech-fueled boomlet has pushed residential occupancy rates to more than 95 percent in the downtown and midtown areas.

NCB Capital Impact, a lender that operates in areas traditional banks tend to leave well alone, has a $30 million fund geared toward refurbishing stone and brick buildings in neighborhoods bordering on the midtown area.

"We are focused on the parts of Detroit that work," said NCB's chief lending officer Scott Sporte. "Not on tearing down buildings where people no longer live."

Still, Detroit's population decline has given rise to a debate over whether to provide services to sparsely-populated areas. People in these areas argue they are already largely ignored by the city's underfunded police, fire and emergency services.

"These areas are like the mining towns in the Old West: the gold and silver have run out," said Richard Ebeling, a conservative economics professor at Northwood University. "Many of these neighborhoods will have to be abandoned."

For Brightmoor residents, the debate over Detroit's future footprint has encouraged them to embrace the blight removal project alongside other efforts to prove people live here and deserve the services they pay taxes for. They don't want to be cast off.

"Brightmoor has not come out favorably in conversations about the future of Detroit," the Brightmoor Alliance's Mayes said. "Our actions are fueled by urgency because if we don't make a mark with our own vision we could become a throwaway community."

headline: Third woman accuses San Diego mayor of unwanted advances
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

A third woman came forward on Wednesday to accuse embattled San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of making unwelcome sexual advances, telling a local television station that he tried to kiss her at a restaurant in 2009.

School psychologist Morgan Rose's interview with KPBS-TV came the same day the mayor appointed a woman as his new chief of staff and a state agency said it would investigate an employment complaint against Filner.

A former aide filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Filner earlier this week and Democrats in the city have urged the 70-year-old politician to resign.

Rose told KPBS she met with Filner in 2009, when he was a California congressman, to promote the work of America's Angel Campaign, a nonprofit she founded to help children.

Rose told the station Filner had asked a private meeting at a San Diego-area restaurant and that after they sat down together he said, "Your eyes have bewitched me."

"And then the next thing I knew, he got up from across the booth, he came over and sat next to me, pinning me into my side of the booth and wanted to kiss me," Rose told KPBS. "And I started to ask him, 'What would your wife say if she was sitting here?' And he just laughed this really odd laugh, as if that was the craziest thing he had ever heard."

Rose added that Filner "tried to move my face towards his to kiss me on the mouth."

A Filner spokeswoman did not return calls seeking comment. The former 10-term congressman, who was elected mayor of California's second-largest city last year, has faced mounting pressure to resign despite his vows to stay in office.

Jack Brandais, spokesman for the San Diego Unified School District, confirmed that Rose works for the district as a psychologist but said he could not arrange an interview with Rose. There was no response to an email sent to Rose's charity, America's Angel Campaign, on Wednesday seeking comment.

On Tuesday, KPBS aired an interview with former Filner aide Laura Fink, who said that he patted her on the behind at a public event in 2005 when she was employed by the then-congressman.

EMPLOYMENT COMPLAINT

An employment complaint against Filner in his role as San Diego mayor has been filed with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), the agency confirmed in a statement on Wednesday.

The statement said DFEH could not provide more information about the complaint which it called "open and being investigated."

A separate complaint requesting a right to sue had also been filed, but that is not being investigated by DFEH because the complainant - whose name was not released - chose to pursue a lawsuit, the agency said.

In a sexual harassment lawsuit filed on Monday, Irene McCormack Jackson, who served as Filner's press secretary after he was elected mayor, accused Filner of asking her to "get naked."

She also accused him of once placing her in a virtual "head lock" - drawing her close with an arm gripped around her neck - while he suggested they get married.

McCormack Jackson was the first woman to publicly step forward to accuse Filner of inappropriate advances.

Calls for his resignation began on July 11, when former San Diego City Councilwoman and fellow Democrat Donna Frye joined two attorneys in leveling allegations that at least one woman, whom they did not name, had accused the mayor of harassing her.

Filner responded by acknowledging that he had "failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them."

In recent days, a number of prominent local Democrats have publicly urged Filner to quit, including San Diego-area U.S. Representatives Susan Davis and Scott Peters and San Diego City Council President Todd Gloria.

Amid the scandal, Filner has pledged to continue governing and appointing new staff.

Filner announced on Wednesday that he had appointed his legal adviser, Lee Burdick, to be his chief of staff. She replaces Vince Hall, who announced his resignation on Twitter a day after the first accusations of sexual harassment were made against Filner by Frye.

Burdick said in a statement she was taking the job "fully aware of the allegations and concerns confronting the mayor and the city" and that she decided to "step forward to help the city through these challenging times."

San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith, who has clashed with Filner in the past, told reporters on Monday that after the allegations arose against the mayor the city took certain precautions, but did not "acknowledge culpability."

"Arising out of that, and at my request, the mayor is not permitted to meet with women alone in city facilities," he said. "That was agreed to with his (personal) lawyer and it is enforced by the chief of staff, the deputy chief of staff. The chief of police is also aware of that and has made some commitments."



headline: Federal jury sentences cop killer to death in New York
byline: By Joseph Ax and Jessica Dye
8:31am EDT

A jury in New York on Wednesday sentenced Ronell Wilson to death for killing two undercover police officers in 2003, setting up what would be the first federal execution of a New York defendant in six decades.

The jury's verdict in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn is the second capital sentence for Wilson, 31, who originally was sentenced to death in 2007 for murdering two officers posing as gun buyers during an attempted sting operation in Staten Island.

That sentence was thrown out by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2010 due to prosecutorial errors, although Wilson's conviction was upheld.

On Wednesday, jurors deliberated for only a few hours following a month-long trial focused on whether to impose the death penalty. If the jury had decided not to sentence Wilson to death, he would have automatically received a life sentence in prison without parole.

The case has seen a number of dramatic twists since Wilson was granted a new sentencing proceeding. Last year, after a hearing that lasted several weeks, U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis ruled that Wilson was not mentally retarded and was therefore eligible for the death penalty.

In February, federal authorities arrested a female corrections officer from the Brooklyn detention center where Wilson was being held and charged her with having sex with him. She gave birth to their son in March and pleaded guilty earlier this month.

Wilson's attorney did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

New York's highest state court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in 2004. Despite the state ban on capital punishment, federal prosecutors are still permitted to seek executions for federal cases.

The last time a federal defendant was executed in New York state was in 1954.

The United States has executed three federal prisoners since the death penalty was reinstated in 1988, including Timothy McVeigh, the man responsible for the 1995 bombing of an Oklahoma City federal building that killed 168 people.

Wilson will be the 60th inmate on federal death row, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Senate on Wednesday approved a bipartisan deal to reverse a recent spike in interest rates on millions of new federal student loans.

The legislation now moves to the House of Representatives, which is hoping to approve the deal before lawmakers leave Washington for a recess in early August.

The Senate voted 81-18 in favor of the deal.

The bill has the support of President Barack Obama, who was involved in negotiating a compromise, and Education Secretary Arne Duncan who said on Tuesday that the deal would be a win for students.

However, in a speech at the University of Central Missouri on Wednesday, Obama said that it was not enough to just lower the cost of student loans, and he promised to lay out a list of "aggressive" ideas by the fall to rein in college costs. "If college costs keep on going up, then there's never going to be enough money," Obama said.

Interest rates on new federal Stafford student loans automatically doubled to 6.8 percent on July 1 after lawmakers, trapped in partisan wrangling, failed to reach an alternative deal on time.

Congress has since sought a retroactive fix that would keep new borrowers from paying the higher rate.

After extensive negotiations last week, senators including Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Republican Richard Burr of North Carolina and Independent Angus King of Maine agreed to a plan to switch loans for the coming school year to a market-based rate.

The rate would roughly work out to 3.86 percent this year for undergraduates.

"This is a prudent and responsible proposal. It's a best of all worlds for students because they get low rates now and a cap if the rates go higher," King said before the vote.

The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act would also retroactively lower interest rates for all borrowers who have taken out federal student loans from July 1, 2013.

The Senate-passed legislation would tie interest rates on undergraduate subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans to the 10-year Treasury note plus 2.05 percentage points, and plus 3.6 percentage points for graduate loans.

It would cap rates at 8.25 percent for undergraduates, 9.5 percent for graduate students, and 10.5 percent for PLUS loans for parents who borrow to pay for their children's college.

The Democrat-led Senate earlier blocked a number of bills addressing student loan interest rates due to partisan disagreements.

Democrats in both the Senate and the House have consistently opposed market-based approaches because they feared students would not be adequately protected from future interest rate spikes as the economy recovers.

They have also criticized Republican plans that would use proceeds from federal student loans to help pay down the nation's debt.

The new student loan deal would reduce the nation's deficit by $715 million over a decade, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.

That is just a fraction of other bills, such as the market-based plan passed by the House that would have reduced the deficit by $4 billion over a decade.

"We wanted this to come as close to deficit neutral as possible and that's what we've come to," said Democratic Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of the lead negotiators. "That's the closest we can come to zero and at the same time have hard caps and keep interest rates low."

In a letter right after the vote, California Representative George Miller, the senior Democrat at the House Committee on Education and the Workforce urged House Speaker John Boehner to immediately bring the bill to vote in the House.

Some critics of the deal said it did not do enough to protect borrowers from paying exorbitant rates when market interest rates rise sharply.

Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer of California said that plan is worse than what would happen under the current law, because rates could go higher than today's rate of 6.8 percent.

But lawmakers voted against any amendments such as one by Democratic Senators Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts that sought to cap undergraduate rates at 6.8 percent for undergraduates and 7.9 for graduate and parent loans.

"This permanent, market-based plan makes students' loans cheaper, simpler and more certain," said Alexander, the senior Republican on the U.S. Senate education committee. "It ends the annual game of Congress playing politics with student loan interest rates at the expense of students planning their futures."



headline: Chicago schools budget seen sinking deeper in the red despite cuts
byline: By Brendan O'Brien
8:31am EDT

Chicago's public schools on Wednesday forecast a record $1 billion fiscal 2014 budget deficit despite layoffs of 1,000 teachers and the expected closing of 50 schools, prompting one credit agency to downgrade its debt rating.

The nation's third-largest public school district blamed the mounting red ink on an expected sharp rise in annual pension payments for teachers, because the state of Illinois has failed to curb ballooning pension costs.

The district also said that salary increases negotiated last September to settle a bitter strike with the Chicago Teachers Union contributed to the budget deficit.

Chicago schools said in a statement that it would slash administrative costs and tap financial reserves to help balance the 2014 budget, forecast to total $5.6 billion.

In May, the Chicago Board of Education approved closing 50 schools, including about 10 percent of all elementary schools - in the largest mass school closing in U.S. history. Two federal court lawsuits have been filed by the teachers union in an attempt to halt the closings.

Last Friday, about 3,000 school district employees were laid off including more than 1,000 teachers.

Chicago student enrollment has been falling for years in part because of residents moving out of the inner city, leaving mostly poor neighborhoods with predominantly African-American and Hispanic students.

Dozens of teachers, wearing red union T-shirts, protested the layoffs and school closings on Wednesday at Chicago City Hall, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the City Council met.

Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded the rating on the Chicago Board of Education's general obligation debt from A2 to A3 in response to its fiscal struggles. The Board of Education issues bonds for the school district.

"We see the direction of the credit profile for the district and the city trending in a more negative direction at this time," said Rachel Cortez, a Moody's analyst.

The state of Illinois faces an unfunded pension liability for state and local workers of some $100 billion but has failed to rein in the ballooning costs. This has had a domino effect on the city of Chicago, which manages its pensions separately but has suffered debt rating downgrades along with Illinois.



headline: Oakland, California, residents warned of rabies risk after bat bites girl
byline: By Laila Kearney
8:31am EDT

Public health officials in the northern California city of Oakland have warned residents to watch out for animals "roaming, staggering or otherwise acting in a strange manner" after a girl was bitten by a rabid bat at the city zoo.

The Mexican free-tailed bat wandered onto the ledge of an otter aquarium and bit the girl on Saturday when she tried to handle it, Oakland Zoo spokeswoman Nicky Mora said.

The girl, a teenage volunteer at the zoo, was recovering on Wednesday and being treated for rabies, Mora said.

She said the bat was wild and did not belong to the zoo. Veterinarians euthanized the bat, which tested positive for rabies, Mora said.

The bite victim, a minor, has since received post-exposure treatments for the disease and appears to be doing fine, she said.

Alameda County health officials sent a warning about rabid animals.

"There may be other rabid animals still undiscovered," the Alameda County Vector Control Services District said on flyers posted around the community. "Report any animals roaming, staggering or otherwise acting in a strange manner in the daytime," it said.

A person does not need to be bitten or scratched by a rabid animal to get the virus, said Daniel Wilson, a spokesman for the vector control district. He said rabies can be contracted when infected saliva touches skin abrasions or mucus membrane.

People exposed to the disease are treated with a vaccine.

Rabies is almost always fatal once symptoms begin to show.

Nationwide, there are one or two cases of human rabies infections reported each year, with the majority of cases being caused by bats, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 40,000 people in the country are exposed to the disease annually and are given post-exposure treatment.



headline: Fugitive Snowden's hopes of leaving Moscow airport dashed
byline: By Lidia Kelly
8:31am EDT

Fugitive U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden's hopes of leaving Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport for the first time in a month on Wednesday were dashed when he failed to secure permission from Russia to leave.

An airport source said Snowden, who is wanted by the United States on espionage charges for revealing details of government intelligence programs, was handed documents by his lawyer that were expected to include a pass to leave the transit area.

But Snowden did not go through passport control, and lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, who is helping him with his request for temporary asylum in Russia until he can reach a country that will shelter him, said the American did not have the pass he needed.

It was not clear whether there had been last-minute political intervention or a hitch, or whether the pass had never been in his possession.

Kucherena said he hoped Snowden's status would be resolved soon. "I must say he is of course anxious about it and I hope that this situation will be resolved in the nearest future," Kucherena said at Sheremetyevo.

"This is the first time Russia is facing such a situation, and this issue of course requires time for the immigration workers."

In Washington, the White House said it was seeking clarification of Snowden's status, the State Department made clear that allowing him to leave the airport would be "deeply disappointing" and Secretary of State John Kerry telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov about the situation.

"The secretary spoke with Foreign Minister Lavrov this morning," said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. "He reiterated our belief ... that Mr. Snowden needs to be returned to the United States where he will have a fair trial."

Bolivia, Nicaragua and Venezuela have said they could offer sanctuary to Snowden, who arrived on June 23 from Hong Kong, where he had fled to escape capture and trial in the United States on espionage charges.

None of the three Latin American countries can be reached by a direct commercial flight from Moscow, so Snowden has requested temporary asylum in Russia until he believes he can safely reach one of them.

The United States wants him extradited to face prosecution and has revoked his passport.

Russia has refused to send him home and risks damage to its relations with the United States if it grants him temporary asylum - a process that could take three months.

Kucherena confirmed Snowden was staying somewhere in the many corridors and rooms of the transit area between the runway and passport control - an area Russia considers neutral territory - and that he had learned the Russian for "Hi", "Bye-bye" and "I'll ring you."

The 30-year-old had received calls from across Russia, with offers to give him money and a place to stay, and even a suggestion by one woman to adopt him. He said he had enough money to get by for now.

Kucherena said he had brought him fresh underwear and shirts and added that he had given him the novel "Crime and Punishment" by 19th-century writer Fyodor Dostoevsky and short stories by Anton Chekhov.

President Vladimir Putin signaled last week that he did not want the dispute to derail Russia's relations with the United States, and the decision on temporary asylum could be delayed until after U.S. President Barack Obama visits Moscow for a summit in early September.

It will be Putin's first summit with Obama since the former KGB spy started a new term last year, and precedes a subsequent G20 summit in St. Petersburg.

DIPLOMATIC FALLOUT FROM LEAKS

Both Russia and the United States have signaled they want to improve ties, strained by issues ranging from the Syrian conflict to Putin's treatment of opponents and Western-funded non-governmental organizations since he started a third term in 2012.

Putin has said Snowden must stop anti-U.S. activities. Snowden has said he does not regard his activities as hostile to the United States, but Kucherena said last week that he had agreed to halt such actions.

Snowden, who has been assisted by the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group, has not been seen in public since June 23, although he had a meeting at the airport with human rights groups on July 13.

He fears the United States will persuade its allies to prevent him using their airspace, or that his plane might be forced down so that he can be taken into custody and extradited.

Kucherena said earlier this week that he did not rule out Snowden seeking Russian citizenship.

There has already been diplomatic fallout from Snowden's leaks, which included information that the U.S. National Security Agency bugged European Union offices and gained access to EU internal computer networks, although the EU is an ally.

China, Brazil and France have also voiced concern over the spying program.

U.S. relations with Latin American states have been clouded by the refusal of four U.S. allies in Europe to let a plane carrying Bolivia's president home from Moscow use their airspace because of suspicion that Snowden might be on the plane.

U.S. lawmakers were also clashing over the case as the House of Representatives debated the 2014 defense spending bill.

The House on Wednesday rejected a proposed amendment from Michigan Republican Justin Amash that would bar the NSA from collecting telephone call records and other data from people in the United States not specifically under investigation.

Obama opposed Amash's amendment, saying it would "hastily dismantle one of our intelligence community's counterterrorism tools."



headline: Capitol Hill hearing focuses on Trayvon Martin shooting
byline: By Deborah Zabarenko
8:31am EDT

The racially charged shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin was the focus of a congressional hearing on Wednesday, where Martin's father vowed to find a way his son's death could lead to positive changes for other black American men.

"We won't let this verdict sum up who Trayvon was," Tracy Martin told a packed hearing of the new Congressional Caucus on Black Men and Boys.

"A lot of people say nothing positive can come out of death, but I disagree wholeheartedly, because what we can do tomorrow as a nation, as a people to stop someone else's child from being killed is certainly a positive," Martin said.

Unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot and killed in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012 by 29-year-old George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who is white and Hispanic, in a case that sparked public debate about racial profiling and Stand Your Ground laws that permit the use of deadly force in self-defense.

Zimmerman's acquittal on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter on July 13 prompted demonstrations across the United States and an extraordinary statement of concern by President Barack Obama.

Federal prosecutors say they are investigating whether Zimmerman violated civil rights laws. But legal experts have said they think new charges are unlikely.

The Martin family has also called for reform of Florida's Stand Your Ground self-defense law, which permits the use of deadly force rather than retreating, when a person has a reasonable fear of serious bodily injury.

"They need to make an amendment that says you can't get out of your vehicle, pursue someone and become confrontational," Tracy Martin told Reuters at a rally last weekend.

On Wednesday Martin praised Obama's comments on the case, in which the president said he himself might have been like Trayvon Martin 35 years ago.

"The most influential man on the planet is weighing in from an African American perspective and just to have the president of the United States comment on our situation really touched me," Martin said.

Martin was flanked by prominent African-American men who testified about their own experiences growing up, including David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellences for African Americans, Michael Eric Dyson, professor of sociology at Georgetown University, and Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman and president of the NAACP.

"All black people live under suspicion," Dyson told the hearing, eliciting nods around the chamber.



headline: Iraq war veteran indicted in death of former U.S. military sniper
byline: By Karen Brooks
8:31am EDT

An Iraq war veteran accused of gunning down former U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, a decorated military sniper, at a Texas shooting range was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday.

Eddie Ray Routh, 25, faces a capital murder charge for allegedly killing Kyle, 38, and a neighbor of Kyle's, 35-year-old Chad Littlefield, with a semiautomatic pistol in February at a shooting range near Fort Worth.

The charge is punishable by life without parole or the death penalty.

The victims were at a shooting range designed by Kyle at the Rough Creek Lodge, an upscale retreat about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth that offers horseback riding, fishing, golf, shooting sports and other outdoor activities.

Kyle and Littlefield took Routh to the shooting range to try to help him relax and deal with personal problems, police have said.

After the shooting, Routh drove in Kyle's truck to his sister's home in Midlothian, a Dallas suburb, and confessed to shooting the two men.

In a 911 call to Midlothian police, Routh's sister and her husband told the dispatcher that Routh suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and had recently been a patient at a mental hospital.

Routh was on active duty in the Marines from 2006 to 2010, and is currently a reservist. He served in Iraq in 2007 and in Haiti following a devastating earthquake there in 2010, and received several medals, including one for good conduct.

Kyle served four combat tours of duty in Iraq and elsewhere, and he won two Silver Stars and five Bronze Stars for bravery, according to his book, "American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History."

After leaving the Navy, Kyle founded Craft International, a firm that provided combat and weapons training to military, police, corporate and civilian clients.

Kyle is the co-author of another book, "American Gun - A History of the U.S. in Ten Firearms," which will be published in May.

headline: Two years after Wisconsin union law, police arrest protesters
byline: By Brendan O'Brien
8:31am EDT

Two years after a Wisconsin law severely curbed public sector union power, police on Wednesday arrested more than two dozen people who have continued to hold daily protests against the law in the rotunda of the State Capitol building.

Capitol Police in Madison, Wisconsin said they arrested 25 people for not having the required permit to demonstrate. Another person was arrested for disorderly conduct after allegedly spitting on a protestor.

Those arrested were taking part in the daily Solidarity Sing Along of Arlo Guthrie and Billy Bragg protest songs every weekday at noon for the last two years.

The sing-a-long began after tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered to protest Republican Governor Scott Walker's February, 2011 plan to reduce the power of unions.

The law made it voluntary for public sector employees to pay union dues and required unions to be certified by a regular vote of members. The protests in 2011 and 2012 forced Walker to face a recall election last year, which he won.

Bill Dunn, 63, one of the regular singers, said the purpose of the demonstrations was to continue opposing Walker's policies and to express the "voices of working class and poor people heard in the halls of power, instead of only those of influence peddling lobbyists."

Dunn and the other protesters were fined $200 and released.

"The Capitol Police are upholding the law to ensure the building can be shared by all citizens who come to the Capitol," said Stephanie Marquis, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Administration, which oversees the Capitol Police Department.



headline: Detroit manager scores first win over unions in bankruptcy bid
byline: By Bernie Woodall and Joseph Lichterman
8:31am EDT

A U.S. bankruptcy court judge on Wednesday dealt a blow to Detroit's public employee unions and pension funds opposed to the city's historic bankruptcy filing by suspending legal challenges in Michigan state courts while he reviews the city's petition for protection from creditors.

Judge Steven Rhodes ordered three lawsuits filed by city workers, retirees and pension funds be halted and extended that stay to suits against Michigan's governor, treasurer and Detroit's emergency manager. Rhodes' action ensures that the only path to fight the city's Chapter 9 bankruptcy petition runs through his courtroom in downtown Detroit.

It also sets the stage for what is expected to be a protracted and bruising battle over the city's eligibility to restructure more than $18 billion in debt and pension and healthcare liabilities under the broad protections of federal bankruptcy law.

"It gives us one venue to settle our disputes. This brings it into one court where it should be," said Bill Nowling, a spokesman for Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr, who attended the oral arguments before Rhodes on Wednesday morning but did not return for the judge's ruling from the bench in the afternoon.

The city's unions and pension funds had hoped to keep the fight in state court, where they felt Michigan's constitutional protections of retiree benefits would prevail against efforts by Orr to scale them back. Now, barring an appeal of the Rhodes ruling, their fight likely turns to convincing the judge that Orr has not dealt with them in good faith in negotiations since he was appointed by state officials in March.

"Stay or no stay, we will never stop fighting for Detroit and its workers," Al Garrett, president of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 25, Detroit's biggest union, said in a statement.

Union members in the packed courtroom held their heads in their hands or shook their heads as Rhodes ruled against them on all three of the motions at issue in the day's proceedings. Meanwhile, city firefighters, worried that the bankruptcy case will lead to stinging cuts in their retirement benefits, protested outside.

Ironically, Wednesday's launch of the bankruptcy case began exactly 312 years after the settlement that became Detroit was founded in 1701 by French soldier Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, after whom the iconic Cadillac automobile brand was named when the city grew to be the cradle of the U.S. automotive industry.

Detroit, which also gave birth to the music industry's Motown sound in the 1960s, has struggled for decades as companies moved or closed, crime became rampant and its population shriveled by almost two-thirds since the 1950s to about 700,000 at present. The city's revenue failed to keep pace with spending, leading to years of budget deficits and a dependence on borrowing to stay afloat.

PROVE INSOLVENCY, GOOD FAITH

The immediate next step in the case now is a procedural hearing before Rhodes set for August 2. At some point after that, Rhodes will preside over formal hearings to determine whether Detroit is eligible to declare bankruptcy. The city's Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy petition is the largest in U.S. history.

The next phase of the case involves the city proving that it is insolvent. The city will also have to prove it made a good-faith effort to negotiate with its creditors or that there are too many creditors to make negotiating possible.

In his initial court filing last week, Orr said the pool of potential creditors, including current city workers, retirees, and bondholders, is vast and it would have been essentially impossible to negotiate with each of them outside of the Chapter 9 process.

In a signal that the judge is going to press both sides into hard negotiations, Rhodes has proposed the appointment of a federal judge as mediator in the case.

Gerald Rosen, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, can direct parties in the case to mediate and designate other mediators, according to the proposed order, which also said information from the mediation sessions would not be disclosed or placed in evidence. Rosen's appointment will be at issue during the August 2 hearing.

Detroit has more than $18 billion of debt and unfunded liabilities it is seeking to restructure, some at rates as low as pennies on the dollar, according to Orr's preliminary offer to creditors last month. Roughly half its liabilities stem from retirement benefits, including $5.7 billion in liabilities for healthcare and other retiree benefits and a $3.5 billion pension liability.

Orr wants to wrap up the city's bankruptcy case by September 2014, but the process for determining a municipality's eligibility for bankruptcy, which in Detroit's case may involve arguments concerning the state constitutionality of the filing, could drag on. In Stockton, California's case, it took almost a year.



headline: Planned Parenthood to pay Texas $1.4 million to settle alleged fraud
byline: By Jim Forsyth
8:31am EDT

Women's health group Planned Parenthood has agreed to pay the state of Texas $1.4 million to settle allegations of fraud in billing to a health program for the poor, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said on Wednesday.

But a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast strongly denied the allegations and said the group settled to avoid a lengthy battle with Texas.

The settlement is the latest in a series of confrontations between Planned Parenthood and the Republican-led state government of Texas.

It follows one week after Texas approved a new law that will force Texas clinics performing abortions to upgrade facilities to those of outpatient surgery centers, which could cost thousands of dollars for each clinic.

Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider operating 13 clinics in Texas which perform abortions, staunchly opposed the new law and has threatened to sue the state.

Texas had previously banned Planned Parenthood facilities in Texas from participating in a state health program for poor women which funds care such as annual exams, cancer screenings and birth control. Planned Parenthood sued the state but ultimately lost in court.

Abbott, a Republican who is running for Texas governor, said on Wednesday that a whistleblower accused Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast of improperly billing Texas for products and services which were never rendered, not medically necessary, or were not covered by Medicaid, the government health program for the poor.

Medicaid is mostly funded by the federal government but administered by the states.

Investigators determined that Planned Parenthood "falsified material information in patients' medical records" in order to support fraudulent reimbursement claims, Abbott said.

Planned Parenthood said the allegations are without merit and the group was settling "as a practical matter."

"Continuing this litigation in the hostile environment for women's health would have ensured a lengthy and costly process that would have distracted our energies and required us to share the private medical information of thousands of women," spokeswoman Rochelle Tafolla said in a statement.

"We are ending this lawsuit in order to devote all of our time and energy to delivering high quality affordable health care."

Abbott, a strong opponent of abortion, is campaigning to succeed longtime Republican Governor Rick Perry in 2014.

Funding for women's health programs has been repeatedly cut by majority Republicans in the Legislature, and last week, Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast announced the closing of three clinics in Texas, one of which performs abortions.



headline: Obama seeks second-term jolt with economic speech
byline: By Roberta Rampton
8:31am EDT

U.S. President Barack Obama sought to inject momentum into his economic and domestic policy agenda on Wednesday with a speech designed to clarify his vision for his second term and hammer Republicans in the House of Representatives for getting in his way.

Obama defended his government's record managing the economy through the recession in his first term and said new spending on infrastructure and education were needed now to grow the middle class, which he argued would boost the nation's economy.

"As Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class could not be higher," Obama said.

His speech was immediately criticized by Republicans for being long on soaring rhetoric, but short on details.

"Americans aren't asking the question â&euro;&tilde;where are the speeches?' They're asking â&euro;&tilde;where are the jobs?'" said John Boehner, the speaker of the House of Representatives.

In coming weeks, Obama said he would give more details of plans to bring back manufacturers that have left America for countries with cheaper costs and to create jobs by investing in bridges, roads and ports.

He also said he wants to give new tax breaks to people trying to save for retirement.

Obama promised an "aggressive" strategy to overhaul education, lower costs and help students gain more relevant skills. That pledge drew sustained applause from supporters in a gymnasium at Knox College in Galesburg.

The Illinois town left a lasting impression on Obama who visited when he was first elected as a senator, a time when Galesburg was struggling after it lost its factories.

GIRDING FOR BATTLE

The buildup to Obama's speech has been relentless, as the White House seeks to get past a rough start to his second term, which has been dominated by a series of thorny domestic and foreign issues.

An early push to toughen gun laws failed in Congress, and the Republican-led House has said it will not move ahead on sweeping immigration reforms passed by the Senate.

The White House has also been thrown off-message by controversies over phone and internet surveillance, and over the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservatives groups seeking tax-exempt status.

Obama faces a battle this fall with Republicans in Congress over the budget and raising the debt ceiling.

While the president wants to increase investment in areas he argues would spur economic growth, Republicans contend that businesses would create jobs if there was less regulatory red tape and lower taxes.

They want to cut spending and have tried to force the administration to scale back its signature healthcare program.

"If his economic agenda is to raise taxes and spend more money, we can't work with him," Republican Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho told reporters in Washington.

Obama has said he does not believe his speech will change minds in Congress, but he hopes to reach constituents to exert pressure on lawmakers from their home states.

"Repealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan. It's not," said Obama. "You can't just be against something, you've got to be for something."

Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, praised Obama's emphasis on infrastructure and education, but said he should also trim regulations to spur job growth.

"Americans need more than a new speech. They need new policies," Donohue said.

headline: Third woman accuses San Diego mayor of unwanted advances
byline: By Marty Graham
8:31am EDT

A third woman came forward on Wednesday to accuse embattled San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of making unwelcome sexual advances, telling a local television station that he tried to kiss her at a restaurant in 2009.

The woman's interview with local television station KPBS came the same day the mayor appointed a woman as his new chief of staff and a state agency said an investigation will be conducted based on an employment complaint against Filner.

It also follows a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Filner earlier this week by a former aide and comes amid calls by fellow Democrats for the 70-year-old politician to resign.

School psychologist Morgan Rose told KPBS she met with Filner in 2009, when he was a California congressman, to promote the work of America's Angel Campaign, a nonprofit she founded to help children.

Rose told the station Filner had asked for a private meeting at a San Diego-area restaurant and that after they sat down together he said, "Your eyes have bewitched me."

"And then the next thing I knew he got up from across the booth, he came over and sat next to me, pinning me into my side of the booth and wanted to kiss me," Rose told KPBS. "And I started to ask him, 'What would your wife say if she was sitting here?' And he just laughed this really odd laugh, as if that was the craziest thing he had ever heard."

Rose added that Filner "tried to move my face towards his to kiss me on the mouth."

A Filner spokeswoman did not return calls seeking comment. The former 10-term congressman, who was elected mayor of California's second-largest city last year, has faced mounting pressure to resign despite his vows to stay in office.

Jack Brandais, spokesman for the San Diego Unified School District, confirmed Rose works for the district as a psychologist but said he could not arrange an interview with Rose. There was no immediate response to an email sent to Rose's charity, America's Angel Campaign, seeking comment.

On Tuesday, KPBS aired an interview with former Filner aide Laura Fink, who said that he patted her on the behind at a public event in 2005 when she was employed by the then-congressman.

EMPLOYMENT COMPLAINT

An employment complaint against Filner in his role as San Diego mayor has been filed with the California Department of Fair Employment (DFEH) and Housing, the agency confirmed in a statement on Wednesday. The statement said DFEH could not provide more information about the complaint which it called "open and being investigated."

A separate complaint requesting a right to sue had also been filed, but that is not being investigated by DFEH because the complainant - whose name was not released - chose to pursue a lawsuit, the agency said.

In a sexual harassment lawsuit filed on Monday, Irene McCormack Jackson, who served as Filner's press secretary after he was elected mayor, accused Filner of asking her to "get naked."

She also accused him of once placing her in a virtual "head lock" - drawing her close with an arm gripped around her neck - while he suggested they get married.

McCormack Jackson was the first woman to publicly step forward to accuse Filner of inappropriate advances.

Calls for his resignation began on July 11, when former San Diego city councilwoman and fellow Democrat Donna Frye joined two attorneys in leveling allegations that at least one woman, who they did not name, had accused the mayor of harassing her.

Filner responded by acknowledging that he had "failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them."

In recent days, a number of prominent local Democrats have publicly urged Filner to quit, including San Diego-area U.S. Representatives Susan Davis and Scott Peters and San Diego City Council President Todd Gloria.

Amid the scandal, Filner has pledged to continue governing and appointing new staff members.

Filner announced on Wednesday that he had appointed his legal adviser, Lee Burdick, to be his chief of staff. She replaces Vince Hall, who announced his resignation on Twitter a day after the first accusations of sexual harassment were made against Filner by Frye.

Separately, Filner had been scheduled to speak next month at a gathering of the National Women's Veterans Association but on Wednesday the group's spokeswoman, Donna Ontjes, said it will no longer host him. The group had originally planned to honor Filner with a lifetime achievement award for his work for members of the military.

Military authorities are investigating several soldiers at the U.S. Army post at Fort Carson in southern Colorado over accusations of sexual misconduct with underage girls, base officials said on Wednesday.

A statement released by Fort Carson said commanders are aware of the probe, but offered few details, citing an ongoing probe into the matter. The base did not identify the soldiers involved.

"We assure the community that the Army is taking this situation very seriously," the statement said.

The allegations are the latest in a series of sexual abuse cases that have rocked the U.S. military in recent years.

A study released by the Pentagon in May said reports of unwanted sexual contact in the armed forces - ranging from groping to rape - jumped from 19,000 in 2011 to 26,000 the following year.

Lieutenant Jeff Kramer, spokesman for the El Paso County Sheriff's Office, said his agency has no involvement with the Fort Carson criminal probe.

Fort Carson is home to the 4th Infantry Division, among other units.

headline: Former UBS banker gets 18 months, $1 million fine, for muni bid-rigging scheme

Former UBS AG banker Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months in prison on Wednesday for his role in deceiving U.S. municipalities by rigging bids to invest municipal bond proceeds, a much shorter sentence than prosecutors had sought.

U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood also ordered Ghavami, a Belgian national and the former global head of commodities at UBS, to pay a $1 million fine.

Ghavami, 45, was the first of three former members of UBS' municipal securities desk to be sentenced in federal court in New York on Wednesday for their role in the scheme. The others, former vice presidents Gary Heinz and Michael Welty, await sentencing.

"I've always tried to conduct my life with integrity and consideration," Ghavami told Wood, before apologizing to affected municipalities and his wife, Julie, and daughter, Athena. "All I want to do is to protect Julie and Athena from harm and to get to the point where we can be a family again."

Prosecutors said the bankers steered financial contracts to their friends in exchange for kickbacks and other favors between 2001 and 2006, while falsely certifying that the processes were competitive.

A federal jury convicted all three last August of conspiring to defraud municipal bond issuers, and also convicted Ghavami and Heinz of wire fraud. UBS agreed in 2011 to pay $160 million in restitution, penalties and disgorgement for the scheme.

Prosecutors were seeking much higher prison sentences for all three, including at least 17-1/2 years for Ghavami. Kalina Tulley, an attorney with the Department of Justice's antitrust division, called Ghavami the "architect" of the scheme.

"These were municipalities that were looking to invest the taxpayers' money," Tulley told Wood. "These defendants abused that trust."

But Wood cut the range of Ghavami's potential sentence, in part because he will not be eligible to serve time in a federal camp, like his fellow defendants; because he will be deported to Belgium after serving his sentence; and because the victims have been made whole by the UBS settlement.

A smiling Ghavami declined to comment after his hearing. But his lawyer, Charles Stillman, said, "We're very pleased at the outcome and we feel that justice was done."

The U.S. Department of Justice charged Heinz, Ghavami and Welty in 2010 as part of its broad investigation of the $3.7 trillion U.S. municipal bond market, in which at least 19 people have been convicted or pleaded guilty.

The case is U.S. v. Ghavami et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-cr-01217.

headline: Hopes of family reunification dashed in immigration reform debate
byline: By Saundra Amrhein

Epifania Rojas' family broke apart in stages. At age 12, she learned how to live without her father. At 16, she is learning how to live without her mother.

The disintegration of Rojas' family began four years ago when she, her parents and four U.S.-born siblings became one of many thousands of families separated by immigration regulations or record-level deportations.

Hopes of reunification for many families swelled this summer with the passage of a sweeping immigration reform bill in the U.S. Senate, only to be dashed by subsequent efforts to kill the bill in the U.S. House of Representatives, where members are focused instead on piecemeal bills heavy on enforcement and more spending on border security.

"It has been an emotional roller coaster," said Cheryl Little, executive director of the Miami-based advocacy group Americans for Immigrant Justice.

U.S. immigration policy has long favored families, though conservative advocates of reform, including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, argue that the number of relatives who are allowed to immigrate to be reunited with family members is too high.

Family-based immigration places a strain on the economy because many who are allowed entry are not of working age and "typically do not produce economic benefits," Bush wrote in his recent book "Immigration Wars."

Expectations among separated immigrant families and advocates ran high after the Senate passed its version of a comprehensive immigration bill on June 27. The bill, were it to become law, would offer a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States while also bolstering spending on border security.

Although Little and other advocates for immigrant families did not approve of provisions that would end sibling sponsorship by U.S. citizens and permanent residents, they applauded other measures that would wipe out a backlog for millions of people waiting years on family-based petitions.

They also celebrated another provision that could make it easier for U.S. citizens and permanent residents to petition for parents, children or spouses who have been deported or blocked from returning to the United States.

"It would be wonderful to see this issue addressed in a humane way," Little said. "We've seen countless wonderful families torn apart."

'THESE KIDS HAVE PARENTS'

Republican House leaders have voiced willingness to support legislation to help undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children - known as "Dreamers" - but not their parents.

The issue was debated Tuesday during a House judiciary subcommittee hearing where key Republicans suggested they would support an exception for the children.

"They surely don't share the culpability of their parents," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said at the hearing. "I do not believe that parents who made the decision to illegally enter the U.S. while forcing their children to join them should be afforded the same treatment as these kids."

Dreamers have been vocal about their rejection of such a proposal that would benefit them, but not their mothers and fathers. The idea also chafed at Little.

"These kids have parents," she said. "To suggest that these children are entitled to a break but we're not going to do anything to keep these families together - it's very disingenuous ... They continue to suffer until that family is made whole."

There are no figures on the exact number of families separated by immigration enforcement. However, among the unprecedented number of deportations that have occurred during the Obama administration - 1.5 million people in his first term - almost 205,000 immigrants deported from July 2010 to the end of September 2012 were parents of U.S.-citizen children, according to official statistics.

Many immigrant families have been separated by other ways, including regulations that blocked immigrants from returning to the United States if they had been in the country illegally for more than a short duration.

In 2009, eight years after her father petitioned as a permanent resident for green cards for Rojas and her mother, they were summoned to a U.S. Consulate office in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, for an appointment. Once there, Rojas was told she could not return with her father and four U.S.-born younger siblings. Her mother was barred from coming back for 10 years.

Rojas tried to calm her weeping siblings. "I told them maybe in a few days or weeks we'll be together again," she said.

Her father, Josefino Rojas, returned to work in the United States with one of Epifania's younger sisters, while his wife took the rest back to her birthplace near Oaxaca.

Epifania was later able to obtain a green card, and she and three of her siblings now live with their father. Between schoolwork, Epifania helps her father in the fields as they migrate between Florida's strawberry fields and Midwest vegetable crops.

Josefino Rojas said he saves what he can after gasoline, rent and food to send to Mexico or to help pay for the next trip there to see his wife and their 5-year-old daughter, also a U.S. citizen.

For some families under the financial and emotional strain of separation, reform may be too late.

This spring, when Juan Aquino graduated with honors from a high school east of Tampa, Florida, one person was missing: his father.

Deported three years ago, Aquino's father pleaded in phone calls with his mother to bring the family to Mexico. Then, last year, giving up on reuniting with his family, he broke the news that he had met another woman in Mexico.

Juan, 18, now enrolled in college courses and active in marches for immigration reform, hopes his mother can gain legal status and that other families won't be split apart. But he no longer dreams of reuniting with his father.

"I don't want to see him anymore," Juan said.

headline: Biggest fines for gouging after Sandy imposed on NY fuel sellers
byline: By Noreen O'Donnell
8:31am EDT

The biggest fines to date for gas price gouging after Superstorm Sandy have been imposed on a gasoline wholesaler in New Paltz, New York and a gas station on New York's Long Island, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced on Wednesday.

Wholesaler, CPD Energy Corp., has been ordered to pay a $50,000 penalty for charging excessive prices at six gas stations that it owns in Westchester, Putnam and Ulster counties, north of New York City, Schneiderman said in a statement.

On Long Island, Mena Inter Inc., which runs a USA Petroleum gas station in Farmingdale was ordered to pay a $23,733 penalty.

New York's price gouging law prohibits merchants from taking unfair advantage of consumers by selling goods or services for an "unconscionably excessive price" during natural disasters.

"As thousands of New Yorkers sat in line for hours waiting to buy gasoline during the state of emergency created by Hurricane Sandy, some crooked station owners increased their retail prices by excessive and illegal amounts," Schneiderman said.

The storm hit the New York area on October 29, 2012, killing more than 200 people and causing $50 billion in damage along the East Coast. In the days afterward, New York saw some of the largest jumps in gas prices in state history, Schneiderman's office said.

After the storm, CPD incurred additional costs of about 16 cents per gallon to transport gasoline to the six stations. However, it increased prices by as much as 70 cents per gallon, the Attorney General's Office said.

So far, total penalties and costs paid by 42 gas stations found to have engaged in price gouging have amounted to $287,618, according to the Attorney General's Office.



headline: U.S. warship returns to sea after generator issues
byline: By Andrea Shalal-Esa
8:31am EDT

The USS Freedom, one of the U.S. Navy's new coastal warships, has returned to sea to participate in a naval exercise with Singapore, after generator problems forced it to return to port over the weekend, a Navy spokeswoman said on Wednesday.

Technicians replaced parts in two of the three diesel generators that power the ship, which was built by Lockheed Martin Corp, Navy Lieutenant Caroline Hutcheson said.

The generator was the latest in a series of problems faced by the warship on its first major overseas deployment. Freedom, the first in the new class of Littoral Combat Ships, arrived in Singapore on April 18.

Officials with the Navy and Lockheed have called the issues typical of those faced by the first ship in a new class.

Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told reporters on Tuesday that the company was working with the Navy on increasing the reliability of the generators, but defended the ship's overall performance.

Among the parts replaced were turbochargers, which increase the speed and power of the generators, worn fuel oil couplings, clogged fuel injectors and temperature sensors - all of which contributed to the overheating that caused the generators to shut down while the ship was preparing for the naval exercises.

Hutcheson said the ship would still be able to participate in the at-sea part of the exercise, also called Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) Singapore.

The ship will join the USS Fitzgerald, a destroyer, USNS Washington Chambers, a cargo ship, a U.S. Navy P-3 aircraft and several Singaporean Navy ships in "the most complex scenario of the exercise, featuring combined training in surface warfare, air defense and anti-submarine warfare," Hutcheson said.

Rear Admiral Tom Rowden, director of surface warfare for the Chief of Naval Operations, said was pleased with the ship's performance during the deployment.

Since departing for Singapore, Freedom has also faced issues with its coolant system, which forced it to port for repairs. Navy tests also found vulnerabilities in its computer network.

Rowden said the Navy would look at whether the generators needed to be modified to improve their reliability.

Rowden said he remained confident that the LCS steel monohull design built by Lockheed, and an aluminum trimaran built by Australia's Austal, would fill gaps in the Navy's ability to detect and destroy mines, fight enemy submarines and conduct surface warfare operations.

The ships' smaller size and ability to integrate new weapons would help the Navy more affordably respond to emerging challenges, such as piracy, he said.

The Navy plans to spend $34 billion to build 52 of the new warships, which were designed to patrol coastal waters while addressing threats like mines and enemy submarines.



headline: Obama halts delivery of F-16s to Egypt amid unrest
byline: By Phil Stewart and Matt Spetalnick
8:31am EDT

16 fighter jets to Egypt, U.S. officials said on Wednesday, in the strongest signal yet of U.S. impatience with Egypt's armed forces after its toppling of President Mohamed Mursi.

The decision appears to underscore deepening U.S. concern about the course taken by the Arab world's most populous country, reeling from violent street clashes following Mursi's July 3 overthrow.

Still, Obama administration officials offered no hint that the decision on the F-16s signaled a shift in broader U.S. policy on aid to Egypt. Washington still has not decided whether to call Mursi's overthrow a coup, something that would legally trigger a cut-off in U.S. assistance.

However, suggesting mounting impatience with Egyptian generals' handling of the situation after Mursi's ouster, an administration official said one of the main objectives was to press the military-led government in Cairo to "move forward and get this democratic transition correct."

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel informed Egypt's military chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, of Obama's decision to halt the delivery of the F-16s in a phone call on Wednesday, the Pentagon said.

"Given the current situation in Egypt, we do not believe it is appropriate to move forward at this time with the delivery of F-16s," Pentagon spokesman George Little said, referring to the situation on the ground as "fluid."

Sisi has called for mass rallies on Friday to give him a mandate to tackle surging violence, fanning fears within Mursi's Muslim brotherhood of a military crackdown. The Muslim Brotherhood has warned of possible civil war.

Sporadic street clashes in recent days have killed more than 100. An overnight bomb attack on a police station north of Cairo killed one person and wounded two dozen.

BRIGHT STAR TO GO AHEAD

16s, despite Mursi's removal.

The Pentagon on Wednesday stressed the importance of ties with Egypt's armed forces and said there was no freeze on overall military assistance, which totals $1.3 billion a year.

This year's Bright Star military exercise with Egypt is still scheduled to go ahead as planned, for example, it said.

"It shouldn't be seen as distancing ourselves from the military," the Obama administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Egypt has been one of the world's largest recipients of U.S. aid since it signed a 1979 peace treaty with Israel.

It was the first Arab country to buy F-16s, widely viewed as a symbol of political and security ties with Washington. U.S.-Egyptian co-production of the M1A1 Abrams battle tank has also been a key part of U.S. assistance.

Obama administration officials played down any connection between the decision on the F-16s and the White House and State Department review of whether to call Mursi's overthrow a coup.

The foot-dragging by the administration has been viewed in Egypt as tacit support for military's overthrow of Mursi.

"The bottom line is, as we've been saying all along, you had tens of millions of people who basically felt like this was the popular will of the people," the Obama administration official said.

"But to be fair, you have tens of millions of people who feel there was an election, Mursi won ... It's not a black-and-white issue on either side."

Lockheed Martin, which builds the jets and is the Pentagon's biggest supplier, declined comment on the issue.

For fiscal year 2013, which ends in September, the United States had already disbursed $650 million in military aid to Egypt as of July 10. An additional $585 million was pending.

An additional eight F-16s are due to be delivered in December. It was not clear whether those deliveries had been suspended as well.

headline: Bulger crony says he confessed to murders to avoid death penalty
byline: By Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

A former top henchman of James "Whitey" Bulger said he pleaded guilty to 10 murders so he could avoid the death penalty after the FBI cracked down on their gang, their boss fled Boston and other gang members started talking to prosecutors.

"However you looked at it, I was dead," Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi testified.

He recalled that in late 1994, a corrupt FBI agent told him and Bulger that authorities were closing in. Flemmi stuck around and got arrested, believing he and Bulger could avoid prosecution since they had spent years informing the FBI about other criminal gangs.

Flemmi said he held out for years, confident he could beat the rap. But he ultimately decided to confess after learning that fellow gangster John "The Executioner" Martorano had begun to talk.

Defense lawyers were questioning Flemmi about why he confessed to the murders, seeking to cast doubt about his five days of testimony against Bulger. Flemmi, the prosecution's star witness, has provided jurors with vivid accounts of several murders he said Bulger committed in front of him.

Bulger, for decades the notorious leader of Boston's Winter Hill gang, is on trial for charges related to 19 murders he is accused of committing or ordering in the 1970s and '80s.

Flemmi, who is serving a life sentence in prison, said he made the plea deal to avoid execution for murders in Florida and Oklahoma, states that have capital punishment.

"I survived an awful lot of things," Flemmi said, but when asked by defense attorney Henry Brennan whether he believed he could have survived the death penalty, he replied, "No."

Flemmi, 79, is among three of Bulger's top henchmen who have taken the stand against their former boss at his federal trial, now in its seventh week. Unlike the other witnesses, Martorano and Kevin Weeks, Flemmi is still in prison.

Martorano and Weeks, who started cooperating with prosecutors before Flemmi did, each served shorter sentences and now are free.

The 83-year-old Bulger, whose story inspired Martin Scorsese's 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed", has pleaded not guilty to all charges, though his lawyer admitted Bulger had been a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark - in other words "an organized criminal."

BLIND EYE OF JUSTICE

For more than a decade, Bulger and Flemmi met regularly with corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, who shared Bulger's Irish ethnicity and a South Boston upbringing. Connolly turned a blind eye to the gangsters' crimes in exchange for information about the Italian Mafia, which was a top FBI target at the time.

Flemmi recalled how Connolly had once kept the heat off him and his boss, sparing them indictment in 1979 when other members of their gang were arrested on charges of fixing horse races.

Fellow gang member Howard Winter was arrested in that sweep, convicted and spent 10 years in prison, Flemmi testified, while he and Bulger continued their crimes with the FBI's knowledge.

Bulger denies being an informant, insisting that he paid Connolly for information but offered none of his own.

Nevertheless, his attorneys had sought to argue that Bulger could not be prosecuted due to an immunity deal with federal authorities. U.S. District Judge Denise Casper did not allow that argument, saying an immunity deal that allowed murder would not be legal.

Flemmi said the 1979 incident convinced him that Connolly could keep protecting him and Bulger from the law. But the corrupt agent was ultimately arrested himself, and is now serving a 40-year prison sentence on murder and racketeering charges.

Bulger's defense has worked to call attention to past lies by prosecution witnesses, and Brennan got Flemmi to concede that when he was arrested in 1994, he did not immediately disclose the relationship with Connolly.

"I was told by John Connolly that he would come forward," Flemmi said. "If I showed that there was a corrupt relationship I wouldn't have had any defense."

The trial has brought jurors back to a different era in Boston history, when Bulger's gang acted with impunity. Some of the murders described took place just blocks from the waterfront site that today is home to Boston's federal courthouse, where the trial is underway.

After fleeing Boston, Bulger spent 16 years in hiding, evading capture even while on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list. Agents arrested him in June 2011 in a seaside Santa Monica, California home where he lived, keeping a cache of guns and $800,000 cash.

headline: Display of loyalty by Weiner's wife draws praise and pity
byline: By Edith Honan
8:31am EDT

If Anthony Weiner remains a contender in the New York City mayor's race after admitting a second time he sent lewd pictures to women he met online, he will have his wife, Huma Abedin, to thank, political watchers said on Wednesday.

Weiner, who resigned from Congress in disgrace two years ago and is now attempting a political comeback, acknowledged on Tuesday that he continued having sexually charged chats for more than a year after his tearful resignation.

Abedin, 36, a longtime aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, broke from the usual playbook of supporting wives when Weiner resigned in 2011 and was conspicuously absent from her husband's side.

But the couple stayed together and Abedin has played a critical role in rehabilitating Weiner's image by sacrificing her well-guarded privacy to publicly support him.

On Tuesday, after a website published a new series of online chats and pictures in which Weiner reportedly used the pseudonym "Carlos Danger," Abedin smiled as she told voters the scandal was behind them and this was a personal matter.

"Anthony's made some horrible mistakes, both before he resigned from Congress and after, but I do truly believe that that is between us and our marriage," Abedin said, allowing she was "a little nervous" about her first press conference. "I love him, I have forgiven in him, I believe in him."

Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, gave Abedin high marks for her appearance on Tuesday.

"I think she did exactly what she needed to do," Miringoff said. "Without her, he was walking to a trapdoor and his candidacy was over. She provides credibility for the changes that he says he's gone through. If you don't believe him, maybe you'll believe her."

'I BELIEVE IN WHAT HE WANTS TO DO'

Others questioned her decision.

The New York Post ran a photograph of Abedin, her head bowed, on its cover, saying Weiner had sent her to "new depths of humiliation." In its editorial calling on Weiner to step out of the race, the New York Times wrote that it was difficult "not to feel for Ms. Abedin."

In an essay to be published next month in Harper's Bazaar magazine, Abedin writes of her long-held reluctance to call attention to herself and why she believes she is doing the right thing in standing by Weiner.

"Quite simply, I love my husband, I love my city, and I believe in what he wants to do for the people of New York," she wrote, according to an excerpt posted on the magazine's website.

Born to an Indian father and a Pakistani mother, Abedin began working at the Clinton White House as a intern in 1996. A decade later, she was featured in a photo spread in Vogue magazine under the headline, "Hillary's Secret Weapon." The weaponry appeared to be her fierce but appealing protectiveness toward the candidate coupled with a distinctive fashion sense.

Often described as Hillary's second daughter, the two remain close.

When she joined Clinton on the presidential campaign trail, the New York Times wrote that Abedin, a practicing Muslim, enjoyed "semi-legendary status for maintaining an improbable level of chic on the campaign trail with a wardrobe of Yves Saint Laurent, Prada and Marc Jacobs."

The image of the hurt but resolute spouse has a secure place in the history of American political sex scandal, at least since Hillary Clinton famously stood by Bill Clinton, then a presidential candidate, in 1992 to defend him against allegations of infidelity.

More than a decade later, when U.S. Senator David Vitter of Louisiana admitted he had paid for prostitutes but said he would stay in office, his wife, Wendy, stood at his side.

And in 2008, when Eliot Spitzer resigned as New York governor after admitting he paid prostitutes for sex, the image of Silda Spitzer standing at his side became the inspiration for the hit TV show "The Good Wife."

On the streets of New York, voters said they were as conflicted in their view of Abedin's role in Weiner's comeback as they were by Weiner's candidacy.

Not Carla Mannino, a Manhattan psychotherapist. "Leave him," she said, echoing several New Yorkers questioned by Reuters. "If I was his wife, I would walk out that door."

headline: Chicago approves $500 million revamp of Wrigley Field
byline: By Mary Wisniewski

old baseball venue.

The privately financed proposal calls for a $300 million renovation of the park itself and $200 million for improvements outside the park, including the hotel.

Famous for its ivy-covered outfield walls, hand-operated scoreboard, and urban location where home run balls sometimes drop onto a residential street, Wrigley Field is a top tourist attraction and has been declared a city landmark.

Approval by the Chicago City Council on Wednesday came after months of tortured negotiations between the Ricketts family - which has owned the team since 2009 - and city officials including Mayor Rahm Emanuel. The park is located in a densely populated and affluent neighborhood.

At one point in May, Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts was so frustrated with the negotiations that he threatened to take the team out of Chicago if he did not obtain the outfield signs for advertising.

The upgrades also include luxury boxes for fans and corporations, new bullpens for the teams and more space for concessions.

Some owners of buildings across the street from Wrigley, who sell tickets to watch games from their rooftops, have objected to the renovation because new outfield signs could obscure their views.

GOAT'S HEAD

Before construction can begin, the Cubs franchise must resolve the threat of a legal challenge from the rooftop club owners, said Julian Green, a spokesman for the Cubs. Another unresolved issue is a proposed pedestrian bridge from the hotel.

Ricketts has agreed not to put up the outfield signs for 10 years, on condition that the rooftop owners do not sue and the city strictly enforces its laws on rooftop viewing, such as limits on the capacity of the rooftops, Green said.

"Thanks to his efforts we are one big step closer to a major investment in one of the top tourist destinations in the state and a major economic engine for Chicago," Green said, referring to Emanuel.

Emanuel said he thought the proposal struck "the perfect balance" between the interests of the neighborhood and those of the team, and praised the Cubs ownership for investing in the community.

"They actually stepped up in the way the prior ownership never had stepped up," Emanuel said, referring to the Chicago Tribune, which owned the team before Ricketts.

The Cubs started playing at Wrigley in 1916 and have not won a World Series since 1908, the longest championship drought in Major League Baseball.

Attendance at the park, which holds 41,100, has fallen to 12th place from 6th place among all Major League clubs over the last 10 years, according to league data. Crowds at home games this year have averaged 33,000, down from an average of 37,000 in 2003.

The Cubs are currently in fourth place of five teams in the National League Central Division, with a losing record.

A lurid reminder of the Cubs' record was sent to Ricketts in April - a goat's head in a box. Chicago legend says that a bar owner cursed the Cubs in 1945 when his pet goat was not allowed into Wrigley during the team's last failed trip to the World Series.



headline: Obama returns to Galesburg, a case in point for a spending appeal
byline: By Roberta Rampton
8:31am EDT

John Eskridge knows what he wants to hear President Barack Obama say when he returns to Galesburg, Illinois, on Wednesday for what the White House has billed as a major economic address.

This town where plants once rolled out refrigerators, ovens, lawnmowers and other stock furnishings of the American home has been hit hard by globalization, losing factories that gave generations of people good jobs right out of high school.

Eskridge, 52, worked at the last plant to close in Galesburg. Maytag, now owned by Whirlpool Corp, shut the plant doors in 2004 and moved the jobs to Mexico - jobs the company has since moved to China.

long resident of the town of 30,000 told Reuters.

The White House has signaled that Obama is unlikely to make any such sweeping announcement in his speech, slated for 12:55 ET (1655 GMT). Instead he will try to get past a bumpy start to his second term in office.

On Monday night, before a group of donors to Organizing for America, an advocacy group run by his former campaign staffers, he previewed his remarks in Illinois: "There's no more important question for this country than how do we create an economy in which everybody who works hard feels like they can get ahead and feel some measure of security."

FROM ANTI-SLAVERY TO MINIMUM WAGE

Eskridge now runs an auctioneering business and appraises antiques. He knows everything about the rich history of this town, once a stop on the Underground Railroad and home to poet Carl Sandburg and George Washington Ferris, who invented the Ferris wheel.

He rattles off visits by at least six other presidents, and speculates that Obama likes Galesburg because it's where Abraham Lincoln argued for the abolition of slavery in 1858 during the fifth of the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates. One of Eskridge's ancestors sat on the speakers' platform.

Obama spoke at Knox College in Galesburg in 2005 when the plant-closing was on everybody's mind. He has said he considered the commencement address his first big speech about the economy.

Many plant workers there had been making $50,000 to $60,000 a year with good benefits. A Knox College study done in 2010 found average income dropped by $10,000. Forty percent of workers said they felt they would never recover financially.

The town hasn't got over the loss of its manufacturing sector, said Eskridge. "You can get jobs, but most of them are at minimum wage. A lot of places don't want to give you too many hours at that, because they don't want to have to provide any benefits."

BACKDROP FOR AN ARGUMENT

It's a district where a Democrat, Cheri Bustos, pulled off an upset in 2012, defeating a congressman backed by the Tea Party in 2010 when Republicans took control of the House of Representatives and began to thwart Obama's agenda.

Galesburg is a symbolic backdrop for the arguments Obama wants to make to Americans in coming weeks and months to prod Congress to allow him to spend more building roads and bridges and giving states grants to hire teachers.

He has described his speech in Galesburg as a "thematic" look at the issues, with details still to come.

Richard Stout, a economist who worked at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors until he moved to Galesburg to teach at Knox College in 1981, said he will be listening for those details.

He stood in line to get tickets for the event, but said he doesn't have high expectations because he thinks Congress will reject anything Obama proposes.

Stout worked on the study of how Galesburg was hurt by the plant closures, and said he thinks infrastructure programs and federal grants would be good steps to help spur the economy.

More jobs would mean people have more money to spend, which means they can buy more manufactured goods, made in factories in towns like Galesburg, he said.

It would also restore faith in the American Dream that hard work can lead to a good living and decent retirement, said Stout. "If you've lost your union job with good benefits and you're now working two part-time jobs and earning $10,000 a year less than you did before ... I think there's a sense of unfairness about that.

"I grew up blue-collar, and I was really lucky. I hit the jackpot. I'm a college professor. But if you're blue-collar, you're saying, 'My God, I've been screwed.'"

Despite empty homes and storefronts, not everyone is despondent about Galesburg.

"People think - and we did too - when a factory closes, that's the end of the town," said Marilyn Webb, journalism professor emeritus at Knox College. She worked on the study with Stout and is writing a book about the surprising number of positive stories.

About a third of the people who lost their jobs say their lot has improved, some in intangible ways.

Nearly 900 people took advantage of government aid to go to college for retraining and found new sources of satisfaction, Webb said. She cited Becky Nott, a woman who pursued her talent for gardening after Maytag closed, finding a job she loves at a garden center.

"These are working-class people who just basically started thinking, 'I've been a cog in a wheel, and life is short - what can I do that makes me feel good about myself?'

"They would have never taken that risk had they not had the factory leave," she said.

Former New England Patriots football star Aaron Hernandez was due in court on Wednesday afternoon for a preliminary hearing on murder charges that could reveal new details in the latest National Football League scandal.

Hernandez was arrested on June 26, nine days after police found the bullet-riddled corpse of a friend, Odin Lloyd, in an industrial park near Hernandez's house in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. He was cut from the Patriots on the same day as his arrest.

The Hernandez case is the latest setback for the NFL, which over the years has struggled with a string of scandals involving players - from O.J. Simpson's murder trial in 1995 to dog fighting, injury bounties, spying and gambling.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his lawyers say the case against him is circumstantial.

Lloyd, a 27-year old semi-professional football player in Boston, was found dead on June 17.

Prosecutors said Hernandez had soured on Lloyd a few nights before the killing after they had been at a nightclub where Lloyd spoke to people with whom Hernandez said he had trouble.

The prosecutors said Hernandez, accompanied by two friends, drove Lloyd to the industrial park, where he shot him five times, twice while Lloyd lay helpless on the ground.

The former tight end also faces a civil suit filed by a Connecticut man, who claims Hernandez shot him in the face after a night together at a Miami strip club in February. Florida police dropped the case after the man, Alexander Bradley, declined to cooperate with investigators.

The Boston Globe reported on Wednesday that prosecutors have also begun presenting a case to a grand jury that Hernandez should be charged in the shooting death of two men on a Boston street last July, citing two unnamed law enforcement officials.

The Suffolk County prosecutor's office and Boston police declined comment on that case on Wednesday.

Hernandez, who was a key piece of the Patriot's offense, had recently signed a $41 million contract with the Patriots, one of the league's top teams.

He is being held without bail at a county jail.

A third woman whose body was found wrapped in a garbage bag in East Cleveland, Ohio, was identified on Wednesday as Shirellda Terry of Cleveland, the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner said on Wednesday.

Two other bodies were previously identified as Shetisha Sheeley, 28, and Angela Deskins, 38, both of Cleveland.

Terry, 18, was identified by dental records and DNA, according to the medical examiner, Tom Gilson.

Terry was the first body found wrapped in plastic bags in a garage of an apartment building on Friday after residents complained of a pungent odor. The two other bodies were found on Saturday.

Michael Madison, 35, of East Cleveland, is accused of the murders. He was arraigned on Friday on three counts of kidnapping and three counts of aggravated murder and is being held on $6 million bond. East Cleveland is a mostly low-income city of about 27,000 people outside Cleveland.

The medical examiner's office said it may take several days to determine the cause of death because of severe decomposition.

The bodies of the women were believed to have been exposed to 90-degree heat for 6 to 10 days.

During a police interview, Madison mentioned the name of a Cleveland serial killer, Anthony Sowell, according to East Cleveland mayor Gary Norton. Sowell was convicted of murdering 11 women and dumping their bodies in garbage bags in and around his home in 2009.

headline: For Detroit, all roads probably lead to bankruptcy court
byline: By Nick Brown
8:31am EDT

With fights over whether Detroit can pursue its bankruptcy filing playing out in both federal bankruptcy court and Michigan state court, many are wondering how the matter will be resolved.

It is impossible to predict precisely how the two cases will play out, but experts agree that sooner or later the dispute is likely to end up with the bankruptcy court handling the city's financial restructuring.

Under federal rules, a bankrupt municipality like Detroit benefits from an automatic stay of litigation taking place in other courts. But before that can take effect, a bankruptcy court must rule that the municipality is eligible to file for bankruptcy.

While the bankruptcy court will not decide Detroit's eligibility for several weeks, the city can in the meantime invoke the right to an automatic stay in the face of any adverse court ruling in state court, experts said, forcing opponents to litigate in bankruptcy court.

Here are the scenarios under which the bankruptcy court gets jurisdiction of Detroit's bankruptcy.

THE CASES

On July 17, retired city workers filed a lawsuit in state court in Lansing, Michigan, saying a bankruptcy filing would violate protections for their pensions under the state constitution.

On July 18, Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr filed the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy, with $18.5 billion in debt and unfunded liabilities, in federal bankruptcy court in Detroit.

STATE COURT LITIGATION

On July 19, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina ordered Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to withdraw his consent for the bankruptcy. The state appealed the ruling. The appeals court's eventual decision could itself be appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court.

1) If the state court system reverses Aquilina's order, the bankruptcy court case would continue on its current course.

2) If the state courts uphold Aquilina's order, Orr could simply refuse to comply. He could argue, under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, that the automatic stay in bankruptcy bars the enforcement of legal judgments from state courts. This would force the objectors to litigate that question in the bankruptcy court.

EXTENSION OF AUTOMATIC STAY

Also on July 19, Orr asked Judge Steven Rhodes to expand the reach of the automatic stay to cover Snyder and other state entities. The city retirees objected, saying Rhodes lacks jurisdiction to act on the request because Detroit should not be in bankruptcy. Rhodes set a hearing on that request for July 24.

1) If Rhodes grants Detroit's request, it will show he believes his court has jurisdiction over Detroit. But, in practice, such a ruling would have little effect on state courts, which may continue to consider state constitutional questions. The bankruptcy case would then likely proceed to its eligibility hearing.

1) If Rhodes denies Detroit's request, it could mean many things, depending on the reasoning he gives. But the case would still likely proceed to an eligibility hearing in bankruptcy court.

The city's request was "expedited," which experts say is likely to result in a ruling within days, or even immediately.

ELIGIBILITY

The next stage would be an eligibility hearing in bankruptcy court, in which Detroit must prove it is eligible to go bankrupt under Chapter 9, which governs municipal bankruptcies.

The eligibility hearing is the forum in Chapter 9 for objectors like Detroit pensioners to have their say in court.

Rhodes has not set a date for an eligibility hearing, which typically comes within several weeks after a bankruptcy filing. The city has asked Rhodes to compel opponents to file their briefs by August 19, which, if he agrees, would suggest a hearing soon after that.



headline: Chicago council to approve $500 million Wrigley Field upgrades
byline: By Mary Wisniewski
8:31am EDT

The Chicago City Council is expected to approve on Wednesday a $500 million proposed renovation of Wrigley Field, the historic home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team.

The 99-year-old ballpark, famous for its ivy-covered outfield walls and hand-operated scoreboard, is a key tourist attraction and has been declared a city landmark, so major plans like a jumbo video message board in left field and a neighboring hotel need approval.

The privately financed proposal includes a $300 million renovation of the park itself and $200 million for improvements outside the park, including the hotel.

The plans have already been approved by the city's landmarks and plan commissions, and the city council's zoning committee approved the proposal on Tuesday evening.

The Cubs started playing at Wrigley in 1916 and have not won a World Series since 1908, the longest championship drought in Major League Baseball.

The Ricketts family, which bought the Cubs from the Chicago Tribune in 2009, say they want to change that losing record and need to revamp Wrigley to generate more revenue to invest in the team.

Attendance at the park, which holds 41,100, has fallen to 12th place from 6th place among all Major League clubs over the last 10 years, according to league data. Crowds at home games this year have averaged 33,000, down from an average of 37,000 in 2003.

With the alderman for the densely populated neighborhood surrounding the park agreeing to support the proposal after months of negotiations, the full council is expected to approve it on Wednesday.



headline: Judge delays enforcement of Alabama abortion law until 2014
byline: By Verna Gates
8:31am EDT

A federal judge on Tuesday delayed until next year the enforcement of Alabama's new abortion law, which tightens restrictions on providers and, according to opponents, could force the closing of more than half of the state's abortion clinics.

The law, signed by Republican Governor Robert Bentley in April, requires every doctor who performs an abortion at a clinic to have staff privileges at a local hospital and mandates the clinics meet the same facility standards as ambulatory care centers.

The law was set to go into effect on August 15.

Tuesday's order by U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson delays the law until March 24, 2014, while the court moves forward on a lawsuit filed in June by Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union.

The delay comes as similar laws have been passed in a number of states.

A law in Mississippi threatens to close the state's sole abortion clinic, which has been unable to obtain hospital privileges for its physicians.

Nine states, including Alabama, have laws on the books requiring abortion clinics to conform to ambulatory care center standards, according to the National Abortion Rights Action League.

Supporters of the law argue it is intended to make abortions safer and improve patient care. But critics say the law will unnecessarily restrict a woman's right under the U.S. Constitution to have an abortion.

The lawsuit said the law will lead to the closure of three out of the state's five licensed health centers that provide abortions.

Most Alabama clinics hire out-of-town physicians to perform abortions and partner with local doctors who have hospital admitting privileges to provide follow-up care.

Doctors at the clinics are often unable to obtain staff privileges because local hospitals oppose abortion or they live too far from the area, the lawsuit said.

The law "would unconstitutionally restrict the ability of Alabama women, including victims of rape and incest, to access safe and legal abortions," said Wayne Sabel, an attorney representing Planned Parenthood Southeast.

State Representative Mary Sue McClurkin, a Republican who sponsored the legislation, said the law's aim was not to shut abortion clinics.

"I am surprised they are filing lawsuits instead of bringing the clinics up to code," she said when the suit was filed.



headline: Detroit bankruptcy judge finally gets his big case
byline: By Tom Hals
8:31am EDT

When Judge Steven Rhodes convenes the first hearing in Detroit's bankruptcy on Wednesday, more than a hint of irony will permeate the city's federal courthouse.

The 64-year-old veteran bankruptcy judge will be presiding over the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, sifting through more than $18 billion in debt and unfunded liabilities, and taking decisions that will affect the lives of city residents, workers and retirees.

But earlier in his career, Rhodes worked hard to attract very different kinds of bankruptcy cases to his courtroom - those of major corporations.

When big companies file for bankruptcy, they almost invariably do so in New York and, to a lesser extent, in Delaware. Lawyers who file the cases cite the experience of the federal bankruptcy judges in those two jurisdictions as the reason for their choice of venue.

Critics, such as Representative John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, say this situation denies unions, employees and local creditors the opportunity to argue their case in a local bankruptcy court.

In 2004, Rhodes drew up new rules that streamlined the administration of large corporate bankruptcies in his judicial district.

And in 2008, at the end of his seven-year stint as the chief bankruptcy judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, he implemented a rule allowing the chief judge to decide who would handle "very large, complex case of national significance." The change ended the random assignment of big cases, a move that bankruptcy lawyers viewed as a signal that complex filings would be handled by experienced judges.

While Rhodes declined to comment on his reasons for his changes, big cases promise business for local lawyers and local businesses like hotels, as well as potential prestige and speaking engagements for the judge.

Despite Rhodes' changes, when General Motors Co and Chrysler, both with big operations in Detroit, filed for bankruptcy in 2009, they elected to do so in New York. Parts maker Delphi Corp also filed for bankruptcy in New York while Visteon Corp filed in Delaware.

Now, four years later, the city that hosts the U.S. auto industry has itself filed for bankruptcy, filing its case based on its geographical location in the Eastern District of Michigan.

Alice Batchelder, the chief judge on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the appeals court for Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, assigned the case to Rhodes under the assignment rules governing Chapter 9 municipal cases.

A graduate of Purdue University and the University of Michigan Law School, Rhodes became a federal bankruptcy judge in 1985. Bankruptcy judges are appointed not by the president but by majority of judges on the relevant appeals court.

Prior to his stint on the bench, Rhodes was in private practice and was an assistant federal prosecutor.

Rhodes, who began his legal career as a clerk in Detroit in 1973, now finds himself presiding over the low point for the city where he has spent his working life.

Attorneys who did not want to be identified because they may end up in front of Rhodes said he is a stickler for procedure and will not be cowed by pricey New York lawyers.

Peter Kelley, who was in private practice with Rhodes in Ann Arbor, Michigan, between 1978 and 1981, said Rhodes will demand everyone come prepared and won't tolerate any attempts to game the system. "He can smell that a mile away," said Kelley.

In 1996, Rhodes rejected a fee application seeking $100 an hour, citing the poor quality of the attorney's work.

In his 24 years on the bench, he has been reversed only a handful of times, according to a search of the Westlaw legal database, an unusually strong record.

Detroit's bankruptcy is likely to be much more bitter than those of Chrysler and GM, which led to taxpayer supported snap restructurings for both companies.

Wednesday's hearing will be to determine whether Detroit's bankruptcy will put on hold various lawsuits that have been filed in Michigan state court by labor unions. The unions are hoping to stop the bankruptcy which they fear will slash retiree benefits.

But while Rhodes may be remembered as the man who oversaw huge cuts to pensions and benefits for the city's retired workers, it is also a chance to oversee a historic case.

"I think it's one of those incredibly unique, challenging cases that's going to raise all sorts of unusual challenges from a legal standpoint, said Sheryl Toby of the law firm Dykema Gossett in Detroit. "I think he likes that."

headline: California men accused of locking girl in box face new drug charges
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
8:31am EDT

Two California men accused of holding a teenage girl captive as a sex slave on their marijuana farm and locking her inside an oversized metal toolbox have also been charged with forcing her to help prepare their cannabis crop for illegal distribution.

Federal prosecutors have seized on the case to support their crackdown against a burgeoning network of pot cultivation and dispensaries they say are fronts for large-scale drug traffickers operating under the guise of California's medical marijuana law.

But advocates of more liberalized cannabis laws argued that the case illustrates how law enforcement efforts have failed, while broad legalization and regulation of pot would remove the marijuana trade from its criminal element.

Ryan Balletto, 30, and Patrick Pearmain, 25, were charged in a criminal complaint unsealed late on Monday with conspiring to distribute more than 1,000 illegally grown marijuana plants and with using a minor in connection with their alleged drug ring.

Balletto also was charged with possessing a firearm for drug trafficking.

The two men were arrested in May on state drug charges, as well as false imprisonment, rape and other sex offenses stemming from the captivity of a 15-year-old girl who police said was held against her will on their remote compound in Northern California.

Balletto and Pearmain were slated to appear on Wednesday for a detention hearing in federal court in Eureka, though the pot farm in question was located to the south in rural Lake County.

State charges against the men were dismissed on Friday to allow federal authorities to more quickly pursue their case against the pair, who could face life in prison if convicted.

According to the federal criminal complaint, authorities searching Balletto's 680-acre property in May found three greenhouses with 1,320 marijuana plants and a cache of ammunition and weapons.

Investigators also seized equipment used for sexual bondage and sadomasochism, a rope tied with a noose and a 4-foot-long metal toolbox "altered to imprison a human," the complaint says.

It says the girl told investigators she was twice locked in the box for a total of three days, and Balletto told her she was a "trouper" for not screaming during her confinement.

She told authorities the two men also put her to work cutting cannabis buds and preparing them to be dried.

The girl, who had been reported missing from Los Angeles, has not been publicly identified because she is a minor. She was taken into protective custody when Balletto and Pearmain were arrested.

"Some in our community believe that marijuana grow operations are run by compassionate caregivers interested only in supplying medicine to the sick," U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag said in a written statement about the case. "Unfortunately, this case illustrates what we in law enforcement see - marijuana grow operations that include heavily armed, violent individuals motivated by profit, carrying out abuses of vulnerable victims."

Amanda Reiman, a California policy manager for the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance, countered that the public would be better served by lifting the federal prohibition on marijuana and allowing state and local authorities to control cannabis.

"Regulation can help deter folks from getting involved in the illicit market," she said. "What Melinda Haag's really doing is making a call for the taxation and regulation of marijuana."

California was the first of 19 states and the District of Columbia to pass laws approving of marijuana for medical purposes, though the federal government continues to classify pot as an illegal narcotic.



headline: $5 million lottery ticket lands New York man in prison

off lottery ticket and sentenced on Tuesday to up to 25 years in prison.

Seven years ago, Andy Ashkar was working behind the counter at his family's store in Syracuse. He took a winning ticket from customer Robert Miles, which was worth a $5 million prize.

Instead, Ashkar told Miles that the payout was worth $5,000, giving Miles $4,000 and keeping $1,000 as the store's portion.

Ashkar claimed the ticket within the mandatory one-year window, according to lottery spokesperson Carolyn Hapeman, and then waited five years to claim the award at the lottery office in Schenectady, New York.

Lottery officials in Schenectady became suspicious when Ashkar couldn't answer simple questions about how he acquired the ticket and called authorities.

Nayef Ashkar, father of Andy Ashkar and owner of the Green Ale Market, is facing a conspiracy charge related to the stolen ticket.

At the sentencing on Tuesday, Onondaga County Judge Joseph Fahey described Ashkar's actions as predatory.

"You've exhibited some of the most rapacious greed I have seen in a long, long time," Fahey said. "You had six years in which you could have righted what you did to Mr. Miles."

The judge noted that Ashkar worked at an auto dealership making $150,000 a year while Miles works as a maintenance worker in the apartments across the street from the convenience store. He sentenced Ashkar to the maximum term of 8-1/3 to 25 years.

Ashkar's attorney, Robert Durr, filed court documents saying he would appeal the sentence, according to Syracuse.com, a news website. Durr was not immediately available for comment.

Assistant District Attorney Beth Van Doren said she was happy with the outcome.

"Robert Miles has waited a long time for this day. We're sending the message to the community that we're not going to tolerate such greed and deception." Miles, who said he forgave Ashkar, may end up with the $5 million after all.

Hapeman said the lottery is in the final stages of its investigation and soon will determine whether Miles will be awarded the latent $5 million prize.

Police returned fired and hit the suspect in the head. The suspect, who was hospitalized in critical condition, was not identified.

Officer Charles Lodatto, 45, the Arlington police 2012 detective of the year, was struck in the right groin. Surgeons repaired his femoral artery but he will need more surgery, Dr. Will Witham told a briefing at Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital in Fort Worth, where they were taken.

Six-year-old Alanna Gallagher's body was found on July 1 wrapped in a tarp about a mile from her home in Saginaw, about 40 miles west of Dallas. The suspect was in a house a few doors from where Gallagher had lived.

"The suspect produced a weapon and shots were fired," said Katherine Chaumont, spokesperson for the Dallas FBI.



headline: Lance Armstrong's former charity Livestrong says donations down

time Tour de France champion, the charity said in its 2012 tax return released on Tuesday.

Livestrong, the Austin, Texas-based charity Armstrong founded in 1997 after he survived testicular cancer, also said sales volume of its signature yellow bracelets had fallen 4.8 percent so far this year compared with a year ago.

The charity has sold 87 million of the ubiquitous bracelets since they were introduced in 2004 to symbolize the fight against cancer.

Armstrong was charged by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency with systematic cheating in June 2012. He was stripped of his Tour de France titles in October and severed official ties to Livestrong in November 2012.

He admitted doping in a January 2013 television interview with celebrity host Oprah Winfrey.

Armstrong has slowly begun to re-emerge in public since then. On Monday, he joined about 20,000 others in a segment of a bicycle ride across Iowa sponsored by the Des Moines Register newspaper.

"People, in general, have been supportive," he was quoted by the Register as saying of the reception he has received in Iowa.

Asked about doping in cycling, he said: "It wasn't a pretty time (in professional cycling). I didn't invent it and I didn't end it."

"My bad for playing along," he told the newspaper.

Armstrong said people should not retaliate against Livestrong because the charity was founded by him.

Livestrong said in the tax return that its revenue fell to $38.1 million in 2012 from $48.8 million the previous year, a 22 percent decline.

But Livestrong Chief Financial Officer Greg Lee said that amount did not include investment gains and other contributions, and Livestrong listed a much higher figure for 2012 total revenue of $48.1 million in its annual report.

"We were very happy that even though there were headwinds faced by investigations and other things around our founder, the foundation weathered through that very well," Lee said in a conference call with journalists.

enhancing drugs.

In papers filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, Armstrong's lawyers said the Postal Service benefited from the sponsorship and they asked a judge to dismiss the federal government's fraud lawsuit demanding its money back.

"The government wanted a winner and all the publicity, exposure and acclaim that goes along with being his sponsor. It got exactly what it bargained for," the lawyers wrote. The Postal Service is an arm of the federal government.

The once-revered athlete is fighting to hang on to what remains of his reputation and his earnings after he was stripped last year of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life from cycling.

In February, a month after Armstrong admitted to doping, the Justice Department said it was joining a fraud suit filed in 2010 by Floyd Landis, a former Armstrong teammate. Landis filed the suit under a federal law that allows whistle-blowers to report fraud in exchange for a reward.

The Postal Service paid $40 million from 1998 through 2004 to have Armstrong and his teammates from Tailwind Sports wear its logo during record-breaking wins. At least $17.9 million of these fees went to Armstrong, according to the government.

The sponsorship contract included promises to obey cycling rules. In arguing those rules were broken, the government is asking for triple damages.

"The Postal Service contract with Tailwind required the team to enter cycling races, wear the Postal Service logo and follow the rules banning performance-enhancing substances - rules that Lance Armstrong has now admitted he violated," Stuart Delery, an acting assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, said in February.

Armstrong's lawyers wrote that despite intense international attention on doping and a French investigation, the U.S. government never suspended the cycling team. Instead, the government renewed its sponsorship.

"It is now far too late for the government to revisit its choice to reap the benefits of sponsorship rather than investigate allegations of doping," they wrote.

The filing argues that the six-year statute of limitations under the anti-fraud False Claims Act expired in 2010, nine days before Landis filed his suit, barring the government's claims.

FORMER TEAMMATES BATTLE

While the court papers argued that the suit was filed too late, Armstrong's lawyers separately asked U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins, who is overseeing the case, to dismiss Landis' complaint against his former teammate.

Landis won the Tour de France in 2006 but was stripped of the title a year later after testing positive for synthetic testosterone.

The fact that Landis, like Armstrong, used performance-enhancing drugs should prevent him from suing under the False Claims Act and getting a reward, Armstrong's lawyers wrote.

"Landis defrauded his fans and other donors in order to amass a fund to pay the legal fees he racked up litigating his false denials," they wrote. "Now he would like to be paid for casting the first stone."

The False Claims Act, which dates to 1863, allows whistle-blowers to sue over suspected fraud involving U.S. government money and, if successful, get a percentage of whatever the government recovers.

Landis' lawyer Paul Scott has said that Armstrong's "false victories" forever hurt the Postal Service. He said on Tuesday that he was still reading through the new legal briefs but that he disagreed with the conclusions of Armstrong's lawyers.

Armstrong's doping scandal led to a cascade of difficulties for the cancer survivor, including the loss of sponsorships, private lawsuits and the end of his affiliation with the Livestrong Foundation, the cancer charity he founded.

Justice Department officials have said they have no plans to bring a criminal prosecution against Armstrong.

medical use of pot.

After two hours of public comments, the Colorado Springs City Council voted 5-4 to bar retail pot stores from opening within the city limits. The debate and vote came after Mayor Steve Bach publicly said he would veto the ordinance if the council approved allowing the recreational outlets.

"I say we should stand with our neighbors on this issue," Bach testified before the vote, referring to nearby communities in the same county that have banned the pot shops.

Colorado Springs has a population of about 420,000 with a large military and evangelical Christian presence and is one of the most conservative and Republican areas in a state which in recent election cycles has turned leftward.

Last year, Colorado and Washington were the first U.S. states to legalize recreational marijuana, and the Colorado law allows cities or counties to outlaw marijuana stores in their communities. Nearly 20 states, including Colorado, allow marijuana use for medical purposes.

Colorado Springs does have medical marijuana dispensaries, which would be unaffected by the recreational pot vote.

But the federal government lists cannabis as a dangerous narcotic and considers it illegal for any purpose, a point underscored by Colorado Springs residents who spoke on Tuesday in favor of the ban.

Brian Burnett, vice chancellor of finance for the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs, said allowing cannabis stores could affect the school's ability to seek government research grants and provide college educations to military veterans.

"We are heavily federally funded," he said.

But resident Rob Wiley urged the council to approve the shops so "black market street dealers no longer will have the exclusive franchise" on marijuana sales.

Elected bodies of 35 Colorado towns or cities have voted to opt out of allowing recreational marijuana stores, according to data from the Colorado Municipal League. The possession and use of small amounts of cannabis by adults is still legal in the communities that have banned non-medical pot shops.

In November, voters statewide will decide whether to impose a 25 percent excise and sales tax on recreational pot sales to fund its regulation and enforcement.

frisk policing policy, setting up a likely showdown with the City Council.

Bloomberg called the bills dangerous and irresponsible and said they would make the city less safe.

One measure would create an independent inspector general to monitor the New York City Police Department. The other would expand the definition of racial profiling and allow people who believe they have been profiled to sue police in state court.

Bloomberg has defended the policy of stopping, questioning and frisking suspected wrongdoers to fight crime.

Opponents of stop-and-frisk, among them minority groups, civil libertarians and some of the Democratic mayoral candidates, have said police officers disproportionately target young black and Hispanic men.

Each of the measures, together called the Community Safety Act, passed the 51-member City Council with the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto.

City Council members who back the measures vowed to override Bloomberg's vetoes.

"The Community Safety Act will help us make New York a place where everyone can walk the streets without fear of violence or discriminatory policing," said Democratic council members Jumaane Williams and Brad Lander. "We look forward to overturning Mayor Bloomberg's veto and making this legislation law."

Bloomberg argued that the first measure would create not an inspector general but an official who would rival the police commissioner on law enforcement policy and strategy.

"The consequences would be chaotic, dangerous, and even deadly for our police officers and for our city," he wrote. The second, he said, would unleash an avalanche of lawsuits against the police department.

Communities United for Police Reform, an organization that advocates an end to the stop-and-frisk policy, said it was disappointed by the vetoes, which it called "misguided."

"New York City must outlaw racial profiling and all discriminatory profiling," it said in a statement.

One of the Democratic mayoral candidates, Bill de Blasio, said Bloomberg was turning a blind eye to racial profiling.

"I believe we need a real change, and encourage City Council members to stand by their votes and override the Mayor's veto," he said in a statement. "Our young men cannot afford for us to waver in the face of intimidation from City Hall."



headline: U.S. probes Southwest Air's LaGuardia landing

8:31am EDT

U.S. safety regulators launched an investigation on Tuesday into the collapse of the front landing gear on a Southwest Airlines plane shortly after it touched down at New York's LaGuardia Airport on Monday evening.

The National Transportation Safety Board said the Boeing 737 skidded 2,175 feet on its nose after the front gear collapsed backwards into the fuselage, damaging avionics and electronics. Nine people out of 150 passengers and crew on board suffered minor injuries, the NTSB said.

The agency had been considering not investigating the incident further, but decided on Tuesday it required further scrutiny. The accident occurred at 5:45 p.m. (2145 GMT) as Southwest's Flight 345 arrived at LaGuardia from Nashville, Tennessee.

The NTSB has an investigator at LaGuardia and is reviewing flight data and cockpit voice recorders at its Washington headquarters. It will also interview the pilots.

Boeing said it has people at the airport who are supporting Southwest and is providing technical assistance to the NTSB.

The landing gear is made by a unit of United Technologies Corp. Company officials have said they were looking into the incident, but could not be reached for further comment.

The accident closed one of the busiest airports in the region for more than an hour Monday evening. More than 180 flights in and out of the airport were canceled by Tuesday afternoon, according to the FlightStats tracking service.

The runway where the jet landed reopened on Tuesday, though the airport reported delays through the day. There were delays of around 90 minutes on Tuesday morning as result of the incident, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the area's airports. There were similar delays at the airport on Tuesday afternoon, but they were a result of low clouds, he said.

The hobbled plane was towed to a hangar, Coleman said.

Southwest spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger said the carrier was cooperating with the safety probe but could not predict how long it would take.

The runway where the jet landed reopened on Tuesday, though the airport reported delays through the day. There were delays of around 90 minutes on Tuesday morning as result of the incident, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the area's airports. There were similar delays at the airport on Tuesday afternoon, but they were a result of low clouds, he said.

The hobbled plane was towed to a hangar, Coleman said.

Southwest spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger said the carrier was cooperating with the safety probe but could not predict how long it would take.



headline: For new U.S. homes, no more mailman at the door under postal plan
byline: By Elvina Nawaguna
8:31am EDT

saving plan by the U.S. Postal Service, Americans moving into newly built homes will not have mail delivered to their doors and will instead have to trek to the curb or neighborhood cluster boxes.

The Postal Service began the change in April, and Congress is considering an even bolder shift that would also affect existing houses. It's unclear if delivery to the door will eventually be eliminated entirely.

"Converting delivery away from door delivery to either curb line or centralized delivery would enable the Postal Service to provide service to more customers in less time," Postal Service spokeswoman Sue Brennan said Tuesday.

More than 30 million American homes get door-to-door delivery and another 50 million get their mail dropped at their curbside mailboxes.

But the Postal Service, which is buckling under massive financial losses, sees savings in centralized mail delivery. Door-to-door delivery costs the Postal Service about $353 per address each year.

Curbside delivery costs $224, and cluster boxes cost $160 per address. With cluster boxes, mailboxes for individual addresses are grouped together at a central neighborhood location.

The move is one of many cost-cutting steps the Postal Service is trying as it continues to plead with Congress for permission to overhaul its business and avert a bailout.

The agency also proposed eliminating Saturday mail delivery but was forced to back off that plan earlier this year after lawmakers and some industries balked at the proposal.

Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican who has spearheaded Postal Service reforms, has introduced a bill that would also completely do away with door delivery and require curbside or cluster boxes for existing residences with an exemption for people with disabilities.

The legislation will be considered on Wednesday by the House Committee on Oversight &amp; Government Reform.

A senior committee staffer said the legislation could realize annual savings of $4 billion from switching to curbside and $6 billion from cluster boxes.

The Postal Service last year lost $16 billion, mostly due to dwindling mail volumes and massive payments into a mandatory fund for its future retirees' healthcare.

The agency, which does not receive taxpayer funds, is under pressure to modify its business model and raise revenues or risk requiring a bailout of nearly $50 billion by 2017.

PHASING IN

The Postal Service's efforts to require cluster boxes for new residences are being received with trepidation.

Cranberry Township, 25 miles north of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, earlier this month received a letter from the local postmaster saying that all new homes would be serviced by cluster box units rather than door-to-door or curbside delivery.

Most new residential construction plans have already been approved and the change would require going back to the drawing board, said Ron Henshaw, the town's director for community development.

"Our board supervisors who actually run the township are very concerned about this," he said.

Since April, residential developers can no longer choose between curbside or cluster box delivery, agency spokeswoman Brennan said. The Postal Service now makes that determination based on what it considers to be more effective.

The Postal Service has also been asking shopping malls and business parks to voluntarily convert to centralized delivery.

Some in the mailing community such as the Greeting Card Association support a switch to a cluster box system.

But others such as the National Association of Letter Carriers and the American Postal Workers Union oppose it.

Sally Davidow, spokeswoman for APWU, said that moving to cluster delivery would put the Postal Service at a competitive disadvantage against its main competitors, FedEx and UPS , which continue to deliver at the door.

headline: House Republicans favor helping children of illegal immigrants
byline: By Rachelle Younglai and Richard Cowan
8:31am EDT

Republicans in the House of Representatives started to coalesce on Tuesday around the idea of legalizing the children who were brought to the country by their parents, marking their first step toward dealing with the millions of undocumented foreigners living in the United States.

Under pressure from members of their own party, religious groups and Hispanics, House Republicans are bucking their traditional position of opposing citizenship for illegal immigrants, saying those children should be given a reprieve.

"They surely don't share the culpability of their parents," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said at a hearing to examine the issue.

But Goodlatte, whose committee is in charge of writing immigration laws, made it clear he did not think the parents should get a pass.

"I do not believe that parents who made the decision to illegally enter the U.S. while forcing their children to join them should be afforded the same treatment as these kids," he said.

The majority of Republican lawmakers believe that giving the illegal immigrant population a route to citizenship is akin to rewarding lawbreakers. Although they agree with Democrats that the country's immigration system does not work, they are deeply divided on how to change the laws.

Of the estimated 11 million foreigners living in the country illegally, around 2 million entered under the age of 16, experts have said.

Goodlatte is working with Eric Cantor, the second-ranking Republican in the House, on legislation to give young illegal immigrants a way to earn citizenship, an approach that could be similar to a Democratic bill they voted against in 2010.

Cantor and Goodlatte have not said when they will introduce the legislation, and it is unlikely they will do so before members hear from their constituents during the month-long August break.

They also have not provided details on their bill or said how it might differ from the Senate's treatment of these children as part of a larger immigration bill.

At the House Judiciary subcommittee hearing, Republican after Republican representative spoke about how it was unfair to lump the undocumented youth with their parents, who broke the law when they crossed the border illegally.

SERVING IN THE MILITARY

Jeff Denham of California suggested that the undocumented children be required to serve in the military to earn legal status in the United States, while Ted Poe of Texas called them special children who should be treated in a special way that would bring them into society because they did not have the intent to break the law.

The Republican chairman of the immigration subcommittee, Trey Gowdy, said the children who were brought to the United States have not committed a crime.

The hearing was stacked with witnesses sympathetic to the undocumented youth, a sign of how Republicans' positions have shifted from the last time Washington debated overhauling the immigration system during the George W. Bush administration.

Republican Representative Steve King, who is vehemently opposed to legalizing any of the undocumented foreigners, asked when would the United States start enforcing the law - though he said the illegal youth's plight tugged "at his heart" as well.

TEARING FAMILIES APART

Known as DREAMers, the undocumented children have already rejected the House Republican approach, saying it will tear their families apart and discriminate against the rest of the undocumented population in the United States.

"Our parents sacrificed everything for our future and we will not leave them behind," Cristina Jimenez, 29, whose parents brought her to the United States illegally from Ecuador when she was 13, said outside the hearing room.

Gowdy and fellow Republican Representative Raul Labrador expressed frustration over how the DREAMers were pushing for citizenship for all of the undocumented foreigners. They said there were people that warranted more scrutiny and that other foreigners working in the United States do not automatically become citizens.

The Senate, with the support of 14 Republican members, has already passed an immigration bill that would increase work visas, bolster security at the U.S.-Mexico border and provide a 13-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is considering a way to force the House to act on the Senate bill. Speaking to a small group of political donors late on Monday, Pelosi outlined a strategy that would require a minimum of 25 Republicans to join Democrats to move the Senate bill in the House.

It is a strategy that traditionally has been difficult for the minority party in the House to pull off successfully.



headline: New Jersey hospitals brace for baby boom from Superstorm Sandy
byline: By Dave Warner
8:31am EDT

When Superstorm Sandy doused the lights along coastal New Jersey nine months ago, it laid the groundwork for a summertime baby boom that has hospitals jumping.

"It was a crazy time," said Dr. Steven Morgan, who practices obstetrics and gynecology at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. "A lot of people were home, a lot of people didn't have TV, and obviously a lot of reproduction was happening."

Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch is on track to deliver about 500 babies this month, up from 371 delivered at the same time last year, said Dr. Robert Graebe, who heads the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department.

Jersey Shore University Medical Center expects about 200 births this month, up from 160 in July 2012.

Both hospitals said they were bringing in extra staff to cope with the baby boom.

Sandy slammed into the area on October 29, causing more than 200 deaths and $50 billion in damage along the East Coast.

Many Jersey communities were without power for long periods of time.

"There is something about that heightened arousal, that sense of emergency and danger that does seem to cause people to form this physical connection, to kind of compensate in some way," said Dr. Christine Tintorer, a psychiatrist at Monmouth Medical.

"It almost sounds like psychobabble kind of stuff, but I think it does tap into this kind of primitive instinct, like to preserve the species."



headline: Ex-CIA official to address government-wary hackers
byline: By Jim Finkle
8:31am EDT

A former CIA official and a retired Air Force general will address next week's Def Con hacking convention, which for the first time asked federal officials to steer clear because of anger over alleged government spying.

Joseph DeTrani, a long-time CIA official who served as a U.S. envoy in talks with North Korea regarding its nuclear activities, will open the hackers' conference on August 2 with a speech about weapons of mass destruction and cyber technology. Former Air Force General Robert Elder, who created one of the U.S. military's first cyber units, will speak the following day.

Def Con founder Jeff Moss said the two had been invited long before his July 11 request that federal officials stay away from the convention to defuse tensions over the U.S. mass surveillance programs leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Moss said that having former U.S. officials at the conference could be useful to the hacking community because they are uniquely placed to help explain the government's position on the surveillance programs.

"Being former, not current, they might be able to speak more freely and offer a more nuanced perspective," said Moss, who is known in hacking circles as The Dark Tangent.

"They would probably offer more credible perspective that people are not going to just dismiss out of hand and say â&euro;&tilde;Of course you are going to say that. That's your job,'" he said in an interview.

Def Con - short for Defense Condition, in military speak - has since 1992 been bringing together people with a common interest in software, computer architecture, and any high-tech system that can be hacked. It typically attracts a small contingent of officials from the CIA, NSA, FBI, and military among hackers, researchers, security workers, activists and others. The conference this year is expected to draw 15,000 people.

DeTrani told Reuters that after his speech he will address surveillance programs, if asked.

"Everything I've heard about these programs is that they were authorized with oversight. From what I know Americans were not spied upon," he said. "Hopefully nobody throws marshmallows at me and says â&euro;&tilde;You wacko, go back to North Korea.'"

DeTrani stepped down as a senior advisor to the Director of National Intelligence in May 2012, ending more than three decades in government, the bulk of the time at the CIA.

His speech will be followed by several panels led by critics of government surveillance. The American Civil Liberties Union is holding a Friday afternoon session on "NSA surveillance and more." Representatives of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group that has filed lawsuits against the NSA over surveillance programs, will review "the year in digital civil liberties."

Elder, who is currently an engineering professor at George Mason University, plans to talk about applying lessons from military operations to protecting computer networks.

He said that while he knows nothing more about the Snowden case than what he has read in the paper, he expects the issue will come up. "I expect there to be some tension," he said.

headline: Despite mutual dislike, Michigan may need Detroit
byline: By Nick Carey
8:31am EDT

Defending his decision to approve America's largest ever bankruptcy filing in Detroit last week, Rick Snyder returned to a point that he has been hitting on since his successful run for governor in 2010: for Michigan to thrive, Detroit must prosper.

"We're the comeback state in Michigan, but to be a great state we need...Detroit on the path to being a great city again," the Republican governor said at a press conference on Friday.

Snyder is one of a growing number of voices arguing that strong economic growth for the only U.S. state to lose population in the past decade cannot come from Detroit's thriving suburbs or smaller prosperous cities, and that the state has an interest in helping Detroit recover.

"There's no such thing as a growing regional economy that is not anchored by a growing, vibrant urban core," said Sandy Baruah, head of the Detroit Regional Chamber.

But when it comes to shelling out money to help, Snyder faces a tough sell with Republicans who feel the city has received too much statewide largesse already. The governor has ruled out a state bailout to cover the city's $18.5 billion in long-term debt but has said repeatedly he wants to help the city. In June Snyder announced a $100 million blight removal program using federal dollars that would benefit Detroit and four other cities in Michigan.

Conservatives say they are fed up with footing the bill for Detroit's mistakes and Detroit, a historically Democratic stronghold, should fix itself by cutting taxes and encouraging business.

"Snyder has won no friends on the left and his own political base thinks he's throwing good money after bad in Detroit," said Bill Ballenger, a longtime pundit and publisher of Inside Michigan Politics. "He's losing support in his own party."

URBAN CORE

Just as cities like Boston, which is a growth engine for Massachusetts with a high number of college graduates that help make it the No. 2 U.S. state for per capita income, Detroit was long the economic driver for Michigan. The Motor City was the cradle of the automotive industry, making Michigan the No. 9 state in terms of per capita income in 1950.

According to the Michigan Future Inc think tank, states like Massachusetts, New York, Illinois and California have leveraged an established industrial base in order to produce high per capita income by taking advantage of the density of well-educated people in their urban cores. Detroit, even in its withered state, has highways and density enough to become such a platform for Michigan's resurgence.

Last week, state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in order to tackle the city's $18.5 billion debt problem. The city's population fell 25 percent in the past decade to around 700,000, atrophied police and fire departments are ill-equipped to battle crime and arson, and basic infrastructure and city services desperately need repair.

Michigan is stagnant, too, falling to 35th place among states in per capita income in 2012. Its employment base has lost 350,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000.

The Detroit metropolitan area's gross domestic product accounts for nearly 46 percent of Michigan's GDP in 2011, the most recent year data is available.

The U.S. auto industry has rebounded after a 2009 government bailout, but it is not expected to create many more new jobs.

David Egner, executive director of the New Economy Initiative, a $100 million fund to aid entrepreneurs in Detroit, said the chances of a comeback all come down to one word. "Talent," he said. "If Detroit doesn't become a talent magnet, Michigan doesn't stand a prayer."

Companies can invest in Detroit at bargain rates, and in downtown, there have been some encouraging signs. Lou Glazer of think tank Michigan Future Inc notes that in late 2010, Google Inc paid more than $630 per square foot when it bought an office building in New York for $1.9 billion. Quicken Loans co-founder Dan Gilbert shelled out just $10 a foot for one downtown Detroit building a year later, part of the $1 billion he has invested in the past 18 months.

Detroit's boosters credit Snyder for timely investments that build on Gilbert's and other investment by philanthropic foundations and social entrepreneurs. He has helped establish lighting and transit authorities for Detroit, launched development of a new light rail line downtown and has backed a planned new bridge across the Windsor River to Canada to boost trade that will be mostly funded by the Canadian government.

Detroit is already the target for multiple state programs and tax provisions. Revenues from special levies add $164 million annually to Detroit revenues, a Snyder spokesman said.

Michigan treasury department data show that for fiscal year 2013 Detroit was slated to receive nearly $260 per person from the state, several times what other cities in the state receive. But even with revenue sharing and special levies, payments to Detroit total around $360 million for the current year, less than 1 percent of the state budget.

Convincing conservatives that Michigan should offer more help to Detroit can be a tall order.

"I am tired of tax money being sucked into that place to fix it," said Tina Dupont, an activist at the Tea Party of West Michigan. "But it's never fixed. We'd be better off without it."

Conservatives have opposed the bridge in particular as an example of government over-spending.

"Just as we have supported Governor Snyder on conservative issues where we agree with him, we will continue to oppose him energetically on issues such as tax increases, healthcare or the bridge to Canada where we disagree with him," said Scott Hagerstrom, Michigan state director of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity.

GAME CHANGER

After decades of mutual antipathy between solidly Democratic Detroit and Republican areas of the state, the city's boosters believe they have an ally in Snyder.

"Snyder knows he is not going to get any votes in Detroit regardless of what he does," said Brian Farkas, executive director of the Detroit Blight Authority, a non-profit dedicated to targeting blight, arguably one of the city's worst problems. "He's doing this because he knows it's the right thing to do."

Snyder's policies may have already dragged down his poll numbers. He faces a relative unknown in the 2014 gubernatorial race in former one-term Democratic Congressman Mark Schauer, but the two have been virtually tied in opinion polls.

Joe Lehman, president of conservative think-tank the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, argues more state aid is not the answer. "Detroit needs a game changer," such as elimination of the city income tax, he said.

Detroit emergency manager Orr has proposed lowering the city's income and property tax rates to levels competitive with surrounding communities.

If the state does let Detroit sink or swim without aid, it could have consequences for the rest of the state, according to a July 1 note from BlackRock analysts, written before the bankruptcy filing.

"Michigan's failure to intervene on Detroit's behalf could result in higher interest rates for other municipalities across the state, as well as potential downgrades as the rating agencies assess... the implications of the state's actions (or lack thereof)," they said.

byline: By Francesca Trianni
8:31am EDT

The elderly son of Brooke Astor, who is one month into a prison sentence for swindling his late philanthropist mother, has been granted an interview for possible medical parole, a Department of Corrections spokesman said on Tuesday.

Anthony Marshall, 89, began serving a one- to three-year sentence on June 21 for stealing millions of dollars from his socialite mother, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. He will appear before the parole board on August 19, said Tom Mailey, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision.

Marshall, a decorated World War Two veteran who was a Broadway producer and U.S. diplomat, has been serving his sentence at the Fishkill Correctional Facility, a prison nursing home some 70 miles north of New York City.

Marshall was in a wheelchair when he turned himself in to authorities in June. In a final attempt to keep him out of prison at the time, his lawyer said that his inability to walk or feed himself made him too frail for incarceration.

"It would be a cruel and unusual punishment to be sentenced to jail at his age, in his condition," Marshall's lawyer, Kenneth Warner, told a judge in Manhattan federal court. "The reality is that ... he is a feeble and frail 89-year-old."

Marshall was convicted in 2009 of grand larceny and other charges for keeping his socialite mother in squalid conditions in her final years and for taking advantage of her deteriorating mental state for his own financial gain.

A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, who prosecuted Marshall for looting Astor's fortune, declined to comment on the parole board's agreement to interview Marshall.

Marshall's attorney did not immediately return a call seeking a comment.



headline: Rural life riskier than city life? U.S. study says yes
byline: By Julie Steenhuysen
8:31am EDT

Contrary to what many believe, the risk of dying from an injury is far less in the city than in the country, U.S. researchers said on Tuesday.

Although homicides in cities far outpace those in rural areas, overall the risk of dying from some form of accident or injury is 20 percent greater in the most rural counties of the United States than in the nation's biggest cities.

The findings may give pause to people tempted to flee cities for the bucolic ideal of rural life, says Dr. Sage Myers, a pediatric emergency medicine specialist at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

"As you moved further and further away from cities you got less and less safe. Even going into the suburbs dropped your safety a little bit," said Myers, whose study was published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine. "It's a little counterintuitive."

Myers said when people think of their personal safety, they tend to think about intentionally inflicted injuries, such as being attacked or shot. But the researchers found that the risk of dying from an accidental injury is 40 percent higher in the nation's most rural counties than in its most urban.

"It turns out unintentional injuries dwarf intentional injuries," Myers said, and those types of injuries occur much more often in rural areas.

Part of the differences in the study may reflect reduced access to trauma centers, which are staffed with doctors who are trained to handle life-threatening injuries. Since most trauma centers are clustered near large cities, rural dwellers may be more at risk of dying from life-threatening injuries.

CAR CRASHES, HOMICIDES

Myers and colleagues studied government data on all injury-related deaths from all 3,141 counties across the United States from 1999 to 2006. They excluded deaths caused by the September 11, 2001, attacks, which the researchers deemed too anomalous to be counted.

Of the nearly 1.3 million deaths during the study period, the overall rate of deaths caused by accidents was 37.5 per 100,000, compared with 17 per 100,000 for homicide and suicides.

The most common causes of injury-related deaths were motor vehicle crashes, which occurred at more than twice the rate in rural areas than in cities. Overall, car crashes caused 27.61 deaths per 100,000 people in most rural areas and 10.58 per 100,000 in most urban areas.

That may be because people in rural areas are more prone to drive on highways at high speeds and some studies have shown people in rural areas are less likely to comply with seatbelt and child restraint laws than are individuals in urban areas.

When the team looked at firearm-related deaths, they found no significant difference in the overall risk of death between urban counties and rural counties but there were significant differences in the trends by age.

In rural areas, for example, children aged up to 14 and adults over 45 had the highest risk of dying from a firearm injury, but among adults aged 20 to 44, the risk of a firearm-related death was much higher in urban areas. The risk was about the same for youths aged 15 to 19, regardless of where they lived.

The study did not look at the number of people who were injured but survived their car crashes or gunshot wounds, which might reflect whether people in urban areas simply have better access to trauma centers than people in rural areas.

PROXIMITY COUNTS

Ian Weston, executive director of the American Trauma Society, a group that represents trauma centers and emergency experts, said when people sustain a life-threatening injury, there is "what we call the golden hour - that first hour post-injury is really the life or death hour."

That is where proximity to a trauma center makes a difference. "In rural areas, it's common that you are seeing transport times of over half hour to an hour to a trauma center," he said, noting that in South Dakota, there are just one or two trauma centers covering the whole state.

That contrasts with a state like New York, where there are nearly 50 trauma centers in the state, he said.

But Tom Smith of the University of Chicago's national opinion research group NORC said while the findings may accurately reflect access to trauma care in the United States, the notion of personal safety goes far beyond whether a person survives a life-threatening injury.

"There's a lot of other components to safety than deaths. What about crimes you weren't injured in?" said Smith, pointing to the two people in his own neighborhood in Chicago who were robbed at gunpoint the previous night. "There were no injuries, but I'm sure they don't feel very safe."

Smith said a survey his group did found many people in cities feel less safe taking a stroll around the block at night than do people in the suburbs, and much less safe than do rural residents.

Myers said more study is needed to tease out the differences in risks between urban and rural areas, but she said such studies should be taken into account as health policy experts consider the placement of new trauma centers.

The study was funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research &amp; Quality, the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.



headline: Doctor accused of Omaha revenge killings held without bond
byline: By Katie Schubert
8:31am EDT

A Nebraska judge on Tuesday ordered a doctor accused of killing four people in revenge for being fired 12 years ago from a university residency program held in prison without bond.

Dr. Anthony J. Garcia, 40, dressed in a yellow jumpsuit and heavily shackled, made his first appearance in Douglas County Court in Omaha on Tuesday morning.

Garcia has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder in connection with the deaths in May of Dr. Roger Brumback and his wife, Mary, in their Omaha home, as well as the murders of 11-year-old Thomas Hunter and his family's housekeeper, Shirlee Sherman, also in Omaha in 2008.

Police say the killings were acts of revenge against Brumback and another Creighton University doctor who fired him from a pathology residency in 2001 for unprofessional conduct.

Garcia was arrested last week in southern Illinois, and extradited late on Thursday to Omaha. An affidavit unsealed last week showed receipts, eyewitness accounts, cell phone records, and evidence at the Brumbacks' home connected Garcia to Omaha at the times of the killings.

Garcia's attorneys argued before Judge Lawrence Barrett Tuesday that the evidence in the affidavit was "circumstantial and thinly veiled." Garcia will be held in the Douglas County Department of Corrections pending a preliminary hearing set for August 14.

The Brumbacks, both 65, were found dead on May 14. Each had stab wounds to the side of their necks and Dr Brumback also was shot, according to the affidavit. Police said the stab wounds were similar to ones found in the 2008 murders.

Garcia was fired in 2001 by Dr Brumback and Dr William Hunter. The murdered 11 year old was Hunter's son, but Police have said they do not believe the boy or the housekeeper were the intended targets.

According to the affidavit and records, Garcia had applied for an Indiana medical license in 2008 and in 2012. Indiana denied his requests. Records released by the Indiana medical board from those applications show he failed to complete residencies in New York, Illinois and Louisiana in addition to Nebraska.

He was suspended from a New York residency for yelling at a radiology technician, then withdrew from the program in 1999. He also withdrew from an Illinois residency, citing migraine headaches.

Garcia's application for a Louisiana medical license was rejected in February 2008, two weeks before Hunter and Sherman were killed, in part because he had not completed the other residency programs.



headline: Pentagon offers to share airwaves with industry, FCC seeks comment
byline: By Alina Selyukh
8:31am EDT

The U.S. Defense Department is proposing to share some of its radio airwaves with the private sector, a nod to growing pressure from the wireless industry and the Obama administration for federal agencies to ease their control of valuable spectrum.

In a letter released by the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday, the Department of Defense offers to share the airwaves it now dominates in the slice of frequencies from 1755 megahertz (MHz) to 1780 MHz with spectrum-hungry wireless and Internet companies.

The military would rearrange its systems within that slice of spectrum as well as the 2025-2110 MHz band and compress programs into the 1780-1850 MHz band that it would retain.

The FCC late on Tuesday also launched a proceeding to gather public comments on a variety of proposals for how the FCC should auction those federally owned or already cleared airwaves to the wireless companies, including input on the Pentagon's new proposal.

"We are committed to finding new and innovative strategies to expedite commercial access to additional spectrum," FCC Acting Chair Mignon Clyburn said in a statement. "I encourage all stakeholders to roll up their sleeves and help us to push this proceeding forward."

The Defense Department uses the airwaves for programs such as pilot training and drone systems and has faced criticism from some in the industry and in Congress for resisting efforts to open those airwaves for commercial use to satisfy growing demands posed by data-hungry gadgets and services.

The Pentagon had pointed to its own need for airwaves as its use of drones and other reliance on wireless technology grows. It also had estimated the process of moving its programs to new frequencies would cost more than $12 billion.

Under the new plan, the Defense Department drops the cost estimate to $3.5 billion by compromising on sharing slices of airwaves without completely clearing any of the spectrum bands.

In the letter, originally sent on July 17 to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which oversees federal airwaves, DOD Chief Information Officer Teresa Takai called the proposal "a workable balance to provide access to the 1755-1780 MHz band most desired by the commercial wireless industry while ensuring no loss of critical DoD capabilities."

The NTIA, in its own letter to the FCC, said it had not had enough time to review the proposal and could not yet endorse it.

The FCC, with NTIA's help, is preparing for several auctions of airwaves to take place in coming years, including one that would sell off chunks of federally controlled spectrum. They will be the first reshuffling of airwave ownership since 2008.

Congress has required the FCC to auction off the 2155-2180 MHz band by February 2015 and the industry has sought to pair up that slice of spectrum with the valuable 1755-1780 MHz band, arguing it would collect more money. Lawmakers in the House of Representatives have introduced a bill to ensure such pairing.

President Barack Obama last month directed federal agencies to look for ways eventually to give up or share more of their airwaves with the private sector. This followed his June 2010 call to open up 500 MHz of federal spectrum for commercial use.

Although the Defense Department's move marks the first big concession by the military for upcoming auctions, the proposal leaves a number of questions unaddressed, including how long the military's programs would remain in the current bands and how the plan may complicate future attempts to clear the spectrum now used by the government.

Defense Department's spokesman Damien Pickart said the review of various options made it clear to the DOD that no one approach would resolve all of the complex concerns in reallocating spectrum and all the stakeholders would have to work out the best solution collectively.

"We remain committed to work cooperatively on a balanced approach that protects mission-critical military operations while making spectrum available for broadband use to keep our economy in a leadership position," Pickart said.

"While there are many details that need to be resolved, this is a significant breakthrough toward meeting the goal of licensing this spectrum, paired with 2155-2180 MHz, by February 2015," said Steve Sharkey, director of government affairs for technology and engineering policy at T-Mobile USA.

A runway at New York City's LaGuardia Airport, shut after a landing gear on a Southwest Airlines jet collapsed on touchdown Monday evening, was reopened Tuesday morning, an airport spokesman said.

Eight people, including three crew members, suffered minor injuries after the incident, Southwest said.

Flight delays of up to an hour were expected for the rest of the morning, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the area's airports.

The airport, one of the busiest in the region, was closed for more than an hour Monday evening after the Southwest Airlines Co plane, which took off from Nashville, Tennessee, suffered the bumpy landing.

The hobbled plane, a Boeing Co 737 with 150 passengers and crew, was towed to a hangar, Coleman said. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration were investigating the incident.

The landing gear is made by a unit of United Technologies Corp. Boeing and United Tech officials said they were looking into the incident.

During the seven weeks of his trial, James "Whitey" Bulger has been called a murderer, drug dealer and, most galling to the former Boston mob boss, a "rat," for informing the FBI about other criminal gangs so he could operate with impunity.

On Tuesday, Bulger's former right-hand man hit the 83-year-old defendant with another accusation: "pedophilia."

Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi, who testified that Bulger killed his step-daughter, was being cross-examined about his sexual relationship with the woman 22 years younger than him. After Bulger's attorney asked him whether he was a pedophile, Flemmi cracked and said his ex-boss also had a relationship with a substantially younger girl.

"You want to talk about pedophilia, right over there at that table," Flemmi said, pointing to Bulger. "He had a young girlfriend, 16 years old, he took to Mexico."

Bulger, who was partners in crime with Flemmi for 20 years, faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted on charges related to 19 murders he is accused of committing or ordering in the 1970s and '80s while running the Winter Hill gang.

The gangster, whose story inspired the 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed," has pleaded not guilty to all charges, although his attorney has admitted Bulger was a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark, in other words an "organized criminal."

On Monday, Flemmi testified that Bulger strangled his stepdaughter, 26-year-old Deborah Hussey, after convincing Flemmi that the woman was a threat to the gang. Described as a drug user, Hussey had taken to hanging out at a bar the gang's members frequented and using Flemmi's name to gain favors.

Flemmi, now 79 and serving life in prison for 10 murders he confessed to a decade ago, acknowledged he began a sexual relationship with Hussey when she was 18 years old and he was 40, which Hussey later "blurted out" to her mother, Flemmi's girlfriend.

STEPDAUGHTER KILLED

Flemmi said he at first was reluctant to help kill the girl. He paid for her rehab and sent her to California and Florida, hoping to get her away from the Boston crime scene.

"I didn't kill her but I agreed with it, yes, to go along with it," Flemmi said. "There's never any justification for murder ... I agreed because I was coerced into it."

Defense attorney Henry Brennan asked Flemmi about testimony from a prior witness that Bulger's attempt to kill Hussey had failed and Flemmi finished the job with a rope. Flemmi denied the charge that he strangled his stepdaughter.

Last week, Flemmi testified that Bulger also strangled a girlfriend of Flemmi's who Bulger feared might reveal their relationship with the FBI.

Prosecutors are expected to wrap their case in the coming days, turning the proceedings over to the defense.

Prosecutors say Bulger gave a corrupt FBI agent from his Irish-American neighborhood information about the Italian Mafia, and that the agent in turn turned a blind eye to Bulger's criminal activity. Bulger and his lawyers have vigorously denied the contention that he ever was an informant.

Witnesses at the trial have recalled an era when Bulger and his cronies routinely shook down bookies, drug dealers and business owners, threatening them with machine guns and burying victims in basements of houses and along the shore.

Bulger fled after a 1994 tip from the corrupt FBI agent that arrest was imminent. He remained on the lam for 16 years, many of them listed prominently on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list of fugitives, before agents caught up to him living in a seaside Santa Monica, California, apartment with a cache of guns and more than $800,000 in cash.

Jack Nicholson played a character loosely based on Bulger in "The Departed."



headline: SEC warns of Bitcoin scams, accuses Texas man of Ponzi scheme

8:31am EDT

A Texas man ran a Ponzi scheme through the virtual online money system called Bitcoin, pocketing some of his investors' proceeds for his personal expenses and gambling, securities regulators charged on Tuesday, warning that the rise of such digital currencies could lead to more frauds.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement that Trendon Shavers, 30, of McKinney, Texas, and his company Bitcoin Savings &amp; Trust used money from new investors to cover withdrawals by other investors and his own expenses.

He raised at least 700,000 Bitcoin, or $4.5 million, from investors in multiple states, the SEC said.

Attempts to reach Shavers or find a representative were unsuccessful. The agency is moving to freeze Shavers' assets and seeking other relief, including financial penalties.

Bitcoin, which is not managed by any one company or government, is a relatively new phenomenon that exists through an open-source software program. Users can buy Bitcoin through exchanges that convert real money into the virtual currency.

In its statement about the Shavers case, the SEC on Tuesday also said it issued an alert warning investors to be on the lookout for scams involving virtual currencies.

"We are concerned that the rising use of virtual currencies in the global marketplace may entice fraudsters to lure investors into Ponzi and other schemes," the SEC said.

Less regulatory oversight and supposed greater privacy of virtual currencies compared with conventional ones could make virtual currencies more attractive to scammers, the agency said.

The U.S. government in May seized two accounts linked to a large Bitcoin operator, Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox.

Also in May, U.S. prosecutors filed an indictment against the operators of digital currency exchange Liberty Reserve, accusing the Costa Rica-based company of helping criminals around the world to launder more than $6 billion in illicit funds.

Bitcoin grabbed headlines in early July when Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins famous for having alleged that Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea that became Facebook Inc, applied to the SEC to launch a Bitcoin-tracking exchange-traded product (ETP) called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.

It is unclear whether the SEC's concerns about Bitcoin laid out in its investor alert on Tuesday could pose a problem for that offering.

The application is currently being reviewed by the SEC's Corporation Finance Division. That division reviews applications to ensure they meet SEC filing guidelines but cannot reject one based on the offering's merits.

However, once an exchange applies to list the ETP, another division in the SEC that oversees trading and markets can explore whether a Bitcoin product is viable or potentially vulnerable to manipulation.

The price of Bitcoin rose slightly to $96.50 during early Tuesday afternoon trading, after ending Monday at midnight at $93.



headline: Proposed U.S. House bill keeps Egypt military aid, amid steep cuts
byline: By Patricia Zengerle
8:31am EDT

Leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives panel in charge of foreign aid proposed on Thursday that military aid for Egypt be kept at $1.3 billion next year, one of few programs left unscathed in a bill seeking steep cuts in international spending.

The draft spending bill from Republican leaders of the House Appropriations committee puts conditions on the military aid, including that the government in Cairo plans and holds elections and honors its 1979 peace treaty with Israel.

Reflecting Washington's struggle to respond to the upheaval in Egypt, the legislation does not include the annual $250 million in economic assistance that has been appropriated for the most populous Arab nation in recent years. That money was not included for fiscal 2014, which starts on October 1, but has not been specifically prohibited, an aide said.

Overall, the proposed State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill totals $34.1 billion, which is $8 billion - or 19 percent - below last year's level. It is even $6 billion below the current level of spending, reflecting the steep government spending cuts, with contributions to some international programs, such as the U.N. Population Fund, eliminated completely.

The House state and foreign operations subcommittee begins debate on the bill on Friday, clearing the way for its consideration by the full committee next week, before eventually making its way for a vote by the full House.

An appropriations subcommittee in the Democratic-controlled Senate is due to begin debate on its version of the measure later this month. The House and Senate bills would have to be reconciled before going to Obama for his signature.

Washington has been grappling with the thorny question of how to handle the aid it sends to Egypt since the military ousted elected Islamist President Mohamed Mursi this month.

U.S. law bars aid to countries where there has been a military coup, a determination that must be made by President Barack Obama's administration, not Congress. But many U.S. officials want to preserve ties to Egypt's military and do not want to risk contributing to further upheaval.

'DEMOCRACY'

The proposed House bill requires that Egypt "demonstrate a commitment to a pluralistic and inclusive democracy," including planning and conducting free and fair elections and protecting freedom of expression, assembly and religion.

The White House has made clear it is in no hurry to cut off aid to Egypt. Its options range from putting off the decision on whether there was a military coup, to finding that a coup took place but winning authority from Congress to keep the money flowing.

Washington still plans to deliver four F-16 fighter jets to Egypt in the coming weeks despite Mursi's ouster.

Other countries have pledged large amounts of aid for Cairo. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have each promised $4 billion.

Cuts in the overall spending bill include slashing funding for operational costs of the State Department and related agencies to $14.6 billion from $17 billion last year.

However, the bill fully funds the Obama administration's request for $4.8 billion for embassy security, to help avert more attacks like the one in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, which killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

House Republicans were criticized in the wake of the attack for having proposed diplomatic security cuts.

The bill would slash bilateral foreign assistance by $5.8 billion to $17.3 billion. Multilateral foreign assistance is cut by 61 percent to $1.2 billion from $3 billion last year.

A State Department spokeswoman said the proposed cuts would cause harm around the world, including dramatically reducing assistance to countries like Afghanistan, Somalia and Burma.

"These proposed cuts, which would be devastating if put into effect, would hurt our ability to stand up for American interests and values around the world. The U.S. can't lead if we retreat in this way," said deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf.



headline: Wrongful death suit in Quebec train crash filed in U.S.
byline: By Casey Sullivan
8:31am EDT

The guardian of a girl whose Canadian father died in the tragic Quebec train crash this month filed a wrongful death lawsuit in Illinois on Monday against a number of railway and fuel services companies connected with the disaster.

The lawsuit is believed to be the first filed in the United States related to the train derailment in the early hours of July 6 that sent 72 tankers of crude oil crashing into the village of Lac-Megantic in Quebec, where they exploded in a ball of fire, killing almost 50 people.

Annick Roy, the guardian of Fanny Roy Veilleux, whose father Jean-Guy Veilleux, a Lac-Megantic resident, allegedly burned to death as a result of the train crash, filed the lawsuit in Cook County. Court documents did not provide the age of Fanny Roy Veilleux, but described her as a minor daughter.

The defendants include railroad operator Montreal Maine and Atlantic Railway Inc, its parent company Rail World Inc, MMA Chairman Edward Burkhardt, and fuel services company World Fuel Services Corp.

Roy alleges in the suit that the companies largely failed to keep the train's oil tankers, known as DOT-111s, up to reasonable government safety standards and are therefore negligent in the death of Veilleux.

"For more than 20 years, problems with DOT-111 tankers rupturing upon derailment have been well documented by government safety regulators and media outlets," Roy said in the lawsuit. "The railroad and petroleum industries have long acknowledged the design flaws in the DOT-111, but have consistently ignored the (National Transportation Safety Board's) calls to address the dangers associated with rupture of the tankers."

Roy said in the lawsuit that the tanker cars that spilled in Lac-Megantic were the same type that ruptured in a 2009 derailment in Cherry Valley, Illinois, that resulted in a spillage of 324,000 gallons of ethanol. The Lac-Megantic tankers lacked safety improvements recommended by the NTSB, the lawsuit said.

Other defendants named in the lawsuit are Western Petroleum Company, Petroleum Transport Solutions, Dakota Plains Transloading LLC, Dakota Petroleum Transport Solutions, Dakota Plaints Marketing and DPTS Marketing.

Montreal, Maine and Atlantic, Rail World, Edward Burkhardt, World Fuel Services Corp and other defendants were approached for comment on the suit but did not immediately respond. Nor did the lawyer representing Roy, Peter Flowers of Chicago-based Meyers &amp; Flowers.

About a week after the crash, Canadian and U.S. lawyers filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of two Lac-Megantic residents, Guy Ouellet and Yannick Gagne, in Quebec Superior Court to seek compensation from the accident. Defendants included the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic and Burkhardt, among others.



headline: Officials identify second East Cleveland murder victim
byline: By Kim Palmer
8:31am EDT

old Shetisha Sheeley, the city's mayor said on Tuesday.

East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton said the body of Sheeley, a resident of Cleveland, was discovered Saturday in a weeded lot near two other bodies. East Cleveland is a low-income city of about 27,000 people outside Cleveland.

Authorities on Monday confirmed the identity of the first victim as Angela Deskins, 38, also of Cleveland.

Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner Tom Gilson said his office made a preliminary identification, based on Sheeley's multiple tattoos, which was confirmed with a fingerprint match.

The name of a third victim has not yet been released. The third woman was found after neighbors complained of a strong, pungent smell coming from a garage behind an apartment building.

The identification of the third victim as well as the cause of death of all three victims may take "a couple of days" due to the severe decomposition of the bodies, according to Gilson.

An arrest was made in the case on Friday. Michael Madison, 35, faces three counts each of kidnapping and aggravated murder, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death. He is being held on $6 million bond. No hearings have been scheduled in the case.

According to court records, he is a registered sex offender who pleaded guilty to attempted rape in 2002.

Madison was arrested at his mother's home, hours after the first body was discovered.

The bodies, two of which were found by trained cadaver-smelling dogs, were located in a garage, the basement of a building and in a weeded lot around the building where Madison lived.

During a police interview, Madison mentioned the name of Cleveland serial killer, Anthony Sowell, who was convicted of murder in the deaths of 11 women, according to Norton. Their bodies were found wrapped in garbage bags in and around his home in 2009.

"These people that are victims have stories, they have lives and they have loved ones," Norton said.

Madison was transferred on Tuesday to the Cuyahoga County jail, where Ariel Castro, 53, is being held. Castro is charged with nearly 1,000 criminal counts, including murder, rape and kidnapping, in the disappearance and the decade-long captivity of three women.



headline: Detroit bankruptcy case heads to Wednesday hearing on challenges
byline: By Bernie Woodall
8:31am EDT

Labor unions trying to stop Detroit from cutting pensions filed a new challenge to the city in bankruptcy court as the federal judge overseeing the case said he would hear arguments on Wednesday.

U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Steven Rhodes agreed on Monday to a request by Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr to fast track a hearing on whether other courts can hear lawsuits against Detroit, while it seeks federal bankruptcy court protection.

Concerned that retirement benefits will be slashed, Detroit retirees, workers and pension funds have filed three lawsuits, including one backed by the United Auto Workers union, in state court in an effort to derail the biggest Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.

A Michigan court judge, for instance, has ordered Orr to withdraw the July 18 bankruptcy filing.

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 25, which represents about 70 percent of Detroit's civilian workforce, on Monday argued if the other lawsuits were stopped, Orr, Michigan's governor and others would be able to continue to operate beyond state constitutional authority.

However, many legal experts said they expect Judge Rhodes to put the other cases on hold.

"Federal bankruptcy law generally trumps state law," and is designed to do so, said Stuart Gold, a Detroit-based bankruptcy lawyer at Gold Lange &amp; Majoros PC.

UNIONS: WE NEVER SAT DOWN WITH ORR

If Orr's request to put those lawsuits on hold is granted, top Michigan state officials, Orr and others would also be protected from litigation regarding last Thursday's bankruptcy petition.

Detroit, a former manufacturing powerhouse and cradle of the U.S. automotive industry and Motown music, has struggled for decades as companies moved or closed, crime became rampant and its population shriveled by about 25 percent in the past decade to 700,000. The city's revenue failed to keep pace with spending, leading to years of budget deficits and a dependence on borrowing to stay afloat.

To remain in bankruptcy court, Detroit must prove that it is insolvent and that it made a good faith effort to negotiate with its creditors, including its employee pension funds, over the city's more than $18 billion of debt, which includes $5.7 billion in unfunded liabilities for healthcare and other retiree benefits and a $3.5 billion pension liability.

Orr told National Public Radio on Monday that the city is broke. "It doesn't matter what I say, it doesn't matter what we look back on, there's just no money," he said.

AFSCME leaders on Monday said that Orr had rebuffed efforts by unions to discuss the issues.

"Not once, did (Orr's) representatives sit down and seek to negotiate a solution with our union," Steven Kreisberg, national director for collective bargaining for AFSCME, told a news conference.

"Our members and our retirees were never given the opportunity to address the serious issues of the type of cutback that the emergency manager is seeking," he said.

Orr has not specified how much pensions or retiree health care will have to be cut, although his June 14 proposal to creditors called for "significant cuts in accrued, vested pension amounts for both active and currently retired persons."

Orr spokesman Bill Nowling said the unions were never promised negotiations. "We will meet with the unions if they ever put a counterproposal on the table."

Under Michigan's emergency manager law the city was not obligated to negotiate in collective bargaining with the unions, Nowling said. "It's a mischaracterization to say they were promised negotiations."

Pensioners could attempt to appeal to the federal district court any order by Judge Rhodes enforcing the stay of litigation against Detroit. But, because such an order would not be considered a final judgment under bankruptcy laws, the federal court could refuse to hear the appeal, Gold said.

In a declaratory judgment on Friday, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said the state law that allowed Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to approve the bankruptcy filing violated the Michigan Constitution. The governor cannot take actions that would violate constitutional protections for retirement benefits for public workers, she said.

Aquilina on Monday morning adjourned a hearing in another case brought by city pension plans with no action taken. The pension plans asked for the proceedings to be postponed one week to July 29.

The historic bankruptcy filing roiled the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market on Friday, sending prices lower and yields higher on some bonds. But the market, where states and cities like Michigan and Detroit borrow money, settled down and prices barely budged on Monday.



headline: California court battle with unions sets stage for pension reform showdown
byline: By Jim Christie
8:31am EDT

largest city, San Jose, and its employee unions faced off in court on Monday over public pension reforms in a case that has major implications for other local governments across the state trying to rein in the costs of retirement benefits.

The lawsuit, led by San Jose's police union, shows how difficult it is for local governments to break benefit promises to current and past employees even when other public services are being cut to pay for them.

San Jose's pension overhaul was promoted by Democratic Mayor Chuck Reed and approved by nearly 70 percent of voters in 2012 but city unions argue the move violates the rights of its members and is in breach of the California constitution. They want the court to block the measure from going into effect and to maintain the current pension plan.

"If the unions prevail it will give local leaders elsewhere reason to pause. If Mayor Reed prevails, they may get even more ambitious in finding new ways to reduce pension outlays," said Larry Gerston, a political science professor at San Jose State University.

In opening remarks in court on Monday, Arthur Hartinger, a lawyer for the city of San Jose, said that the pension measure was necessary given the city's strained finances. "Retirement cost increases have gone through the roof," he said.

But Gregg Adam, a lawyer for San Jose's police officers, countered that employees' vested rights are at issue, adding that they can't be legislated away. "Decades of California law says 'No'".

The trial is expected to run through Friday. Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Patricia Lucas will have up to 90 days to make a ruling on the trial's central issue of whether the city's pension overhaul of current employee's benefits is at odds with state law. Analysts say her ruling will be appealed.

Reed told Reuters outside the courtroom the city is ready for a long legal fight regardless of Lucas' ruling. He said the city would appeal all the way to the California Supreme Court if necessary.

PENSIONS COME AT A COST

In recent decades, municipalities across the country have provided their workers with higher retirement benefits, both pensions and health coverage, often in lieu of pay increases. But this has often created a future burden for budgets, made worse in some cases by skipping payments into pension funds.

Two other California cities, Stockton and San Bernardino, last year filed for bankruptcy due to deep financial problems that include spiking pension costs.

Detroit's decision to file for bankruptcy on Thursday, the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy filing ever, was also partly related to the cost of pension and other post-retirement benefits for city employees.

San Jose's pension reform, which has not yet been adopted because of the lawsuit, does not reduce benefits already earned by employees, but would require them to either pay higher contributions to maintain current benefits or receive lower benefits.

It also requires new city employees to split pension contributions evenly with the city. San Jose, which has two pension funds, currently pays $8 toward pension benefits for every $3 contributed by its employees, according to Dave Low, a spokesman for the mayor.

Reed made tackling San Jose's pension spending, which rose to $245 million last year from $73 million in 2001, a priority. San Jose has had to slash other spending to help cover the costs and balance its budgets.

San Jose, Silicon Valley's biggest city, is starting to see its revenue pick up as its economy and real estate market strengthen, but Reed says city services could be back on the chopping block without the projected savings from the pension reform.

Savings from the measure will help balance San Jose's books in future years and restore services cut over the past decade in response to budget shortfalls, said Low.

A FLAWED MEASURE, UNIONS SAY

Unions for public employees don't see it that way.

"The mayor's initiative was flawed from the get-go because it pulls the rug out from employees who have worked hard, played by the rules and expected the city to keep its promise," said Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for Californians for Retirement Security, a coalition representing more than 1 million public employees.

"The foundation of California's public pension system for nearly a century is that pensions are a legally protected promise," Maviglio added.

The court hearing San Jose's case consolidated five lawsuits brought by two unions, individual employees and retirees.

The unions argue that any change in employee benefits needs to be negotiated and cannot just be imposed by the city.

Public sector unions in California say the law shields their pension benefits from changes as they are the property of employees tied to their compensation.

San Jose's public pensions are generous in comparison to others in California, which are already well above the country's average.

The average San Jose police officer and firefighter who retired in the past decade, and worked for 26 years, gets an annual pension of $100,000, while the average civilian city employee who retired in the past decade, and worked for 20 years, has an annual pension of $45,000, according to proponents of the city's pension reform measure.

The average yearly pension benefit for a member of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the pension system for state workers and scores of local government across the state, was around $29,000 in April.

The case is in Santa Clara County Superior Court, No. 1-12-CV-225926.

A Southwest Airlines plane flying from Nashville to New York City landed without its nose gear at LaGuardia airport on Monday but no one was hurt, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.

Flight 345, which left Nashville, Tennessee, at 1:55 p.m., reported possible front landing gear issues as it approached the airport, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said in a statement.

"The plane's nose gear collapsed as the aircraft landed on Runway 4 at 5:45 p.m. EDT (2145 p.m. GMT)," Bergen said. "The plane safely came to a stop and no injuries were reported."

The FAA is investigating the incident. The airline said passengers had been evacuated from the plane, but it did not say how many people were onboard.

"Emergency responders at New York's LaGuardia airport are assisting with an evacuation of flight 345 after the Boeing 737 arrived this evening from Nashville," Southwest said in a statement, without giving further details.

Televised images of the plane, which CNN reported was carrying more than 100 passengers, showed it surrounded by emergency vehicles.



headline: Dallas suburb cannot bar housing to illegal immigrants, court rules
byline: By Terry Baynes
8:31am EDT

A federal appeals court on Monday rejected a Dallas suburb's controversial law that would have prevented illegal immigrants from renting housing.

In a 9-6 ruling, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld a lower-court decision to block the ordinance in Farmers Branch, Texas, finding that the law interfered with the federal government's authority over immigration policy.

The law would have required renters in the suburb to register with the city and obtain an occupancy license. The city's building inspector would verify an applicant's immigration status with the federal government, and landlords who rented to unregistered tenants would face criminal fines or face losing their rental licenses.

By creating new criminal offenses and allowing state courts to review a non-citizen's immigration status, the law conflicted with federal law, a majority of the judges concluded, citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Arizona's immigration laws.

Kris Kobach, a lawyer for Farmers Branch, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Farmers Branch ordinance is one of numerous state and local efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. Arizona in 2010 passed its harsh set of immigration laws, which the Obama administration challenged in court.

The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the most controversial aspect of Arizona's immigration overhaul, a requirement that police officers check the immigration status of the people they stop. But the court also struck down other provisions of the law, including a requirement that immigrants carry immigration papers at all times.

The Texas case is Villas at Parkside Partners et al v. City of Farmers Branch Texas, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 10-10751.



headline: Jackson's mother says he denied prescription drug problem
byline: By Dana Feldman
8:31am EDT

Michael Jackson's mother testified on Monday in her wrongful death lawsuit against concert promoter AEG Live that the late pop star denied he was abusing prescription drugs when she confronted him in the years before his death.

Katherine Jackson, 83, said under cross-examination that she and her family had heard rumors that the singer was abusing pain medications but never saw him under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the final years of his life.

"I told him I heard that he was using prescription drugs," the Jackson family matriarch told jurors in her second day on the stand in the trial in which she and Jackson's children are suing AEG Live over the singer's death.

AEG has argued that Jackson had prescription drug and addiction problems for years before entering into any agreement with the company.

The King of Pop died at age 50 in June 2009 in Los Angeles from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol while preparing for his "This Is It" series of comeback shows in London.

The lawsuit alleges that privately held AEG Live hired Dr Conrad Murray as Jackson's personal physician. Murray was caring for the singer as he rehearsed for the shows and the doctor was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 for administering the propofol that killed Jackson.

Katherine Jackson, dressed in a purple and white coat and a dark pink top, said she confronted her son about the rumors at his Las Vegas residence, where he lived from 2006 to 2008. She did not say exactly when she brought up her concerns.

"He didn't want me to worry," Jackson said when questioned by AEG Live attorney Marvin Putnam about whether she knew he would deny the rumors.

"He's my son," she added. "I didn't think it was that serious. When a child respects his mother and doesn't want her to think it's that bad, he'll deny it."

Putnam said he will call Jackson back to the stand and hopes to convince the jury that she and Michael's siblings knew of his addiction and hid it.

"No one had a closer relationship than she did. She did everything to ensure the world didn't know," Putnam told reporters outside court.

'NO DEEP DISCUSSION'

Katherine Jackson, who said that was the only time she confronted her son about drugs on her own, acknowledged that she knew her famous son was taking prescription medication for head and back pains but said she did not believe he was abusing them.

Jackson's mother, who grew frustrated at times with Putnam's questioning, said that she and her children together asked the singer about his rumored addictions in 2002, believing that her presence would have a stronger impact on him.

"We just saw that he was OK and he was upset," she said of the family's intervention. "So we didn't talk about it. ... There was no deep discussion."

Katherine Jackson concluded her testimony tearfully reiterating earlier statements from Friday that AEG Live failed to get her son proper medical attention or reach out to his family when he fell ill while preparing for his comeback tour.

"I wanted to hear what happened to my son," she said when asked why she initiated the lawsuit.

Jackson cried when her attorney, Brian Panish, showed a photo of the pop singer appearing gaunt and sleep-deprived shortly before his death.

AEG Live has said it did not hire or supervise Murray and could not have foreseen that Murray posed a danger to Jackson. Putnam said he does not plan to call Murray to testify but he will call "many, many, many doctors" Jackson saw over the years.

AEG Live began its defense on Monday by calling former executive John Meglen to the stand shortly before court was adjourned.

Michael's oldest son, Prince, 16, has already testified. The younger children Paris, 15, and 11-year-old Prince Michael II, also known as Blanket, were not expected to testify. Michael's nephews T.J. and Taj Jackson, sons of brother Tito Jackson, have also testified.

The trial, which started in April and was supposed to last three months, is expected to conclude in September.



headline: Former aide sues San Diego mayor, charging sexual harassment

old politician of asking her to "get naked" and kiss him.

The lawsuit was brought by the mayor's former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, three days after the county Sheriff's Department set up a telephone hotline to field complaints of sexual misconduct against him.

McCormack Jackson is the first woman since the scandal broke a week and a half ago to charge publicly that the mayor, a Democrat and former 10-term U.S. congressman from California's second-largest city, had harassed her.

The mayor has recently admitted to inappropriate behavior toward female staff members but has indicated that he would not step down.

The 11-page suit, filed in San Diego County Superior Court, accuses Filner on one occasion of placing McCormack Jackson in what she described as a virtual "head lock" - drawing her close with an arm gripped around her neck - while he suggested they get married and asked, "Wouldn't it be great if we consummated the marriage?"

The complaint quotes Filner on a separate occasion, last month in the press secretary's City Hall office, as telling her, "When are you going to get naked? Come on and give me a kiss." The lawsuit said she responded by telling him he should leave.

"The past six months turned out to be the worst time of my entire working life," McCormack Jackson told a news conference. "I had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by Mayor Filner as sexual objects or stupid idiots. I saw him place his hands where they did not belong on numerous women."

MAYOR 'SADDENED'

"I am saddened by the charges that were leveled against me today," Filner said in a statement in response to the lawsuit.

"Once due process is allowed to unfold, I am certain there will be a better understanding of this situation," he said. "I remain committed to the people of San Diego and the work that needs to be done. My dreams and plans for moving this City to new heights are continuing."

The mayor went on to add that he did not believe "these claims are valid."

McCormack Jackson was hired by Filner in January but resigned as the mayor's spokeswoman in June and is now director of communications for another city department.

Calls for Filner's resignation began on July 11, when former San Diego city councilwoman and fellow Democrat Donna Frye joined two attorneys in leveling allegations at least one woman, who they did not name, had accused the mayor of harassing her.

Filner responded by acknowledging that he had "failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them."

He went on to say he had "reached into my heart and soul and realized I must and will change my behavior," adding that he was seeking professional help and that he and his staff would undergo sexual-harassment training.

Days later, Frye and the two lawyers, Marco Gonzalez and Cory Biggs, called again for Filner's resignation and gave more graphic details of his alleged behavior. Frye said then that the mayor had made unwelcome advances against two constituents and had "jammed his tongue down" the throat of one of them.

Marco and Gonzalez said a client who worked for Filner had alleged he groped her and suggested that she not wear panties.

In recent days, a number of prominent local Democrats have publicly urged Filner to quit, including San Diego-area U.S. Representatives Susan Davis and Scott Peters and San Diego City Council President Todd Gloria.

Filner's top two aides also have resigned since the scandal emerged.

Before he was elected mayor in 2012, Filner represented the southern portion of San Diego and much of the California-Mexico border area for 20 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, including a stint as chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.

headline: California university under investigation over handling of rapes
byline: By Alex Dobuzinskis

The U.S. government is investigating the University of Southern California's handling of reported cases of rape on its campus near downtown Los Angeles, school officials said on Monday.

The sex discrimination probe by the U.S. Department of Education came in response to a complaint by the school's Student Coalition Against Rape.

Tucker Reed, a student who founded the group earlier this year, said the university did not respond properly when she reported being sexually assaulted.

"I blogged openly about the details of my rape and the university's abuses and watched as my inbox filled with emails from fellow students who had experienced the same injustices and the same silencing," Reed told reporters on Monday.

Jody Shipper, the school's chief of equity and diversity, said the university was told by federal officials that the complaint had been filed in May by two students who alleged sex discrimination based on the university's handling of the reports of assaults.

The complaints were made under Title IX of the federal education code. Title IX is commonly associated with college sports but more broadly it also prohibits gender discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual violence at universities.

"We look forward to working with (the Office of Civil Rights) to address any concerns and review our protocols as needed," Shipper said in a statement.

The Student Coalition Against Rape did not immediately release a copy of its report on the incidents.

Stephen Spector, a spokesman for the Department of Education, said in an email the complaint "is currently under investigation." The agency could not comment further on the case, he said.

An annual crime report from the University of Southern California showed seven cases of forcible sex offenses in its university park area in 2011, the most recent year for which statistics are available.

The California university is not the only school being investigated by the Department of Education over its handling of rape cases.

The agency in May began a compliance review of Dartmouth College to examine such issues as sexual harassment grievance procedures and the New Hampshire college's response to such claims, Spector said.



headline: Zimmerman helps rescue family from overturned vehicle, police say
byline: By Barbara Liston

George Zimmerman, who was acquitted earlier this month of murder and manslaughter in the death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, helped rescue a family from an overturned vehicle in Florida last week, authorities said on Monday.

Zimmerman, 29, helped get them out of the overturned sport utility vehicle last Wednesday, barely four days after the not-guilty verdict, the Seminole County Sheriff's Office in central Florida said.

"He did not witness the crash. He rolled up on it after the fact and assisted in getting the family out of the vehicle," sheriff's spokeswoman Kim Cannaday said.

When a deputy arrived at the scene, two men, one of whom was identified as Zimmerman, had already helped get the parents and two children out of the vehicle, Cannaday said. The two men then left.

Cannaday said no one was injured. The family's identity and race were not immediately known.

Asked if Zimmerman was being called a hero, Cannaday said, "We're not going that far."

The verdict in the racially charged Martin case sparked protests in cities across the country, as well as calls to review Florida's "Stand Your Ground" self-defense law which allows persons in fear of their lives to use deadly force rather than retreat.

Zimmerman, who is part Hispanic, was the neighborhood watch captain in the Retreat at Twin Lakes community in Sanford at the time of the killing in February 2012.

Martin was a student at a Miami-area high school and a guest of one of the homeowners. He was walking back to the residence after buying snacks at a nearby convenience store when he was shot in the chest during a confrontation with Zimmerman.

Sanford police on Monday turned over all evidence in the case to the Orlando office of the FBI, including the gun used in the shooting, Sanford police said.

The U.S. Justice Department last week put a hold on the evidence pending an investigation into whether Zimmerman violated civil rights laws, requiring the evidence to be kept intact rather than returned.

Public opinion is evenly divided over the verdict, according to several recent polls. The Pew Research Center found that 39 percent of people surveyed were satisfied with the verdict and 42 percent were dissatisfied, with 19 percent having no opinion.

In the same poll published on Monday, 52 percent say race is getting more attention in the case than it merits, while 36 percent say the case raises important issues about race that need to be discussed.



headline: White House finds the funny in 'Obamacare' pitch to youth
byline: By Roberta Rampton

What's so funny about President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law?

A website known for viral comedy videos popular with Americans under 30 - Funny or Die - has a few ideas and is enlisting celebrities to make something that catches the attention of a key demographic the White House needs to sign up for Obamacare.

"I think you can kind of have fun with some of the misinformation that's out there," said Mike Farah, president of production for Funny or Die.

Farah was part of a small group of Hollywood stars and entertainers who met with senior White House officials on Monday to talk about how to use pop culture to persuade young Americans to sign up for new medical insurance coverage this fall.

For Obamacare to succeed, the White House needs to attract 2.7 million younger consumers between the ages of 18 to 35, mostly male and non-white, to participate in new online health insurance exchanges.

Obama dropped by the meeting, which included comedian Amy Poehler, actor Jennifer Hudson, representatives for Oprah Winfrey and Alicia Keys and others.

"We see that there's an ability here to actually make an impact and make a change," Farah told Reuters after the meeting with Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and other officials involved in rolling out the program.

Funny or Die has more than 19 million unique users per month and 6.4 million Twitter followers and is already working on several videos featuring celebrities.

Obamacare needs young, healthy people to register for the new health insurance plans to counterbalance older, sicker enrollees and hold down costs.

But first the government needs to overcome skepticism that the new plans are worthwhile.

The government isn't paying for the help. "If there was ever any money for Funny or Die - which there never was - I'm sure it would have been cut by the sequester long ago," Farah quipped.

Earlier this year, the administration sought help from major U.S. sports organizations including the National Football League on advertising campaigns.

But the NFL backed off after U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell wrote the league and other professional sports organizations urging them not to support Obamacare, warning them it was too political.

Farah said he is not worried about any backlash.

"If Republican senators have enough time to write Funny or Die a letter telling us not to be a part of this, then we're doing something right," he said.

"I would love that, and I can't wait to frame it and put it up in my office."



headline: Court rejects appeal over leveraged funds' volatility
byline: By Jonathan Stempel

traded funds that aimed to magnify market movements.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said ProShares Advisors LLC was not liable to investors who claimed they were misled about the risks of holding on to 44 of its leveraged ETFs for more than one day.

Among these risks is that ETFs could cause losses even if investors bet correctly on the direction of particular markets.

Monday's decision upheld a September 2012 ruling by U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in New York.

Christopher Lovell, a partner at Lovell Stewart Halebian Jacobson representing the investors, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Leveraged ETFs use derivatives and debt to amplify short-term returns. They are designed for short-term investors who target outsized gains and can stomach large losses if a market moves against them.

ProShares, one of the largest providers of the product, offered ETFs designed to double, move inversely to, or double the inverse performance of an underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis.

Thus, if an index rose 2 percent on a given day, then these ETFs would be expected to respectively rise 4 percent, fall 2 percent and fall 4 percent. Leveraged inverse funds are also known as "ultra short" funds.

Investors contended that between August 2006 and June 2009, a period covering the global financial crisis and a plunge in stock prices, ProShares failed to disclose the risks that its ETFs might post substantial losses, and knew it could happen even if investors bet correctly on a market's direction.

They cited as an example a three-month period when a U.S. bank stock index fell 22.84 percent. They said a ProShares ETF meant to double that index's inverse performance might have been expected to gain 45.68 percent, but instead fell 17.3 percent.

Circuit Judge Richard Wesley, however, wrote for the 2nd Circuit that ProShares had disclosed the "speculative" nature of the ETFs in prospectuses, and that the ETFs might move "quite different from and even contrary to" what investors expect.

"No reasonable investor could read these prospectuses without realizing that volatility, combined with leveraging, subjected that investment to a great risk of long-term loss as market volatility increased," Wesley wrote.

In 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued an alert that advised buy-and-hold investors about the "extra risks" posed by leveraged and inverse ETFs. (<a href="http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/leveragedetfs-alert.htm">here</a>)

"ProShares clearly and comprehensively disclosed the risks of investing in their ETFs in a volatile market," said Robert Skinner, a partner at Ropes &amp; Gray, in an interview. "The plaintiffs' bar has tried to take advantage of the financial crisis in these lawsuits, but courts have recognized that all of the relevant risks were fully disclosed."

Skinner also represented fund distributor SEI Investments Distribution Co, another defendant.

The case is In re: ProShares Trust Securities Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 12-3981.



headline: Woman sexually assaulted during Seattle church service
byline: By Elaine Porterfield
8:31am EDT

A registered sex offender has been jailed on suspicion of sexually assaulting a woman as she was in the midst of prayer during Sunday church services in Seattle, police said on Monday.

The suspect was subdued inside the sanctuary by several of the victim's relatives, who restrained the man until police arrived on the scene of what officers called one of the most outrageous sexual assault cases they had ever encountered, Seattle Police spokeswoman detective Renee Witt said.

"We've all seen and heard some pretty bizarre and egregious things, but this ... it just kind of blows your mind," Witt said.

The 25-year-old victim was accosted while attending services with her family and boyfriend on Sunday morning at Saint Spiridon Russian Orthodox Cathedral, a church just north of downtown Seattle familiar for its blue, onion-shaped domes.

Police said the assault began when congregants rose during the service, and the suspect, identified as Aaron Little, 37, reached over and lifted the woman's skirt to peer under it.

The victim initially did not realize the intrusion, but several of her male relatives witnessed it and hustled the man out of the church through its front door, Witt said.

But before the relatives could return to their pew, the man dashed back into the chapel through a side door and sexually assaulted the woman, Witt said. The woman's family members once again caught up with the suspect, grabbed him and called police, she said.

"Four people actually held him for us until we got there," Witt said. "He's really lucky they used the restraint they did, considering what he did. Good for them."

The man, who lives in a small town south of Seattle and has a previous conviction for sexual assault, told officers he has mental health problems, Witt said.

He was jailed without bond on suspicion of rape, but it will be up to prosecutors to decide how he might be charged, police said.



headline: San Diego mayor sued by former aide charging sexual harassment

old mayor of asking her to "get naked" and kiss him.

The lawsuit against Filner and the city of San Diego was brought by the mayor's former director of communications, Irene McCormack Jackson.

The 11-page complaint, filed in San Diego County Superior Court, quotes Filner as telling Jackson last month in her office in City Hall: "When are you going to get naked? Come on and give me a kiss."

Talk of harassment has dogged Filner, and the mayor recently has acknowledged inappropriate behavior toward female staff members. But Jackson is the first woman to charge publicly that he had harassed her.

"The past six months turned out to be the worst time of my entire working life," Jackson told a news conference. "I had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by Mayor Filner as sexual objects or stupid idiots. I saw him place his hands where they did not belong on numerous women."

Filner's representatives could not immediately be reached for comment on the lawsuit. The mayor, a Democrat and former member of Congress, has said he will not step down.

Jackson was hired by Filner in January but currently director of communications for city operations. Her lawsuit also accused Filner of employment discrimination.



headline: Ohio man charged with kidnap, murder of three women found in plastic bags
byline: By Kim Palmer
8:31am EDT

An Ohio man charged with kidnapping and murdering three women whose bodies were found wrapped in plastic bags was ordered held on $6 million bail on Monday, as police investigated the possibility of other victims.

"There may be more to this, which is why we are continuing to do searching and use other agencies to help us along," East Cleveland Police Chief Ralph Spotts told reporters at a press conference.

Michael Madison, 35, a registered sex offender who pleaded guilty to attempted rape in 2002, was arraigned in East Cleveland Municipal Court on three counts of kidnapping and three counts of aggravated murder - a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death.

He was arrested on Friday at his mother's home hours after the first body was discovered not far away in the garage of the apartment building where Madison lives. Neighbors' complaints of a pungent smell triggered the search.

"We believe if left on the streets just one hour longer, (he) may have put the lives of others in danger," East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton said at the press conference.

During a police interview, Madison invoked the name of a Cleveland serial killer, Anthony Sowell, who was convicted of murder in the deaths of 11 women whose bodies were found wrapped in garbage bags in and around his home in 2009, Norton said, declining to elaborate further.

"Things that he said made us believe he was influenced by Sowell," Norton added.

In court, Judge William Dawson said the $6 million bail he set represented $1 million for each count.

Handcuffed and wearing a gauzy purple jumpsuit and diamond-like earring, Madison quietly told the judge he understood the charges against him.

Madison, his head closely shaven and beard trimmed, declined to enter a plea and waived a preliminary hearing. His case will now be transferred to Cuyahoga County Court.

Authorities said he would be taken to the Cuyahoga County jail, where Ariel Castro, a former school bus driver, is being held in a separate kidnapping case involving three female captives.

The bodies, two of which were found by cadaver-smelling dogs, were located in a garage, the basement of a building and in a weeded lot nearby. The bodies had been there for about six to 10 days, during which temperatures soared into the 90s, said the mayor.

One of the victims was identified as Angela Deskins, 38, Norton said. Authorities were working to identify the other two victims, he said.

Autopsies conducted on all three women could not immediately determine a cause of death because their bodies were so badly decomposed, said Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner Thomas Gilson.

General contractor James Fambro, who worked on Madison's sparsely furnished apartment, said it had once been occupied by the mother of Madison's child before she moved out. Fambro said that after Madison's arrest, he entered the building's garage and saw blood on the floor.



headline: Bankrupt Detroit's downtown renaissance creates trickle of hope
byline: By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert
8:31am EDT

time industrial powerhouse. Today the city bears an uncomfortable resemblance to a failed state: unable to light or police the streets, educate children, stop arson, or provide emergency care to the dying.

There is, however, a mini-renaissance occurring in the downtown core. It is here that Detroit might just be carving out a new identity, this one driven not by cars but by computers. The Internet-focused businesses springing up have attracted thousands of young, well-educated, tech-savvy "urban pioneers."

Amid the ruins of a city that has lost nearly two-thirds of its population since the peak of 1.8 million in 1950, a younger generation with no recollection of Detroit's glory days is settling into condos and lofts in the downtown and midtown areas. Here, say local optimists, lies potential hope.

Today Detroit is "a tale of two cities," said Edsel Ford II, a great-grandson of Henry Ford and local philanthropist. Images of urban blight are inescapable, but there also is an "exciting, thriving metropolis" downtown. "That's the Detroit I know," he said. "And that's the Detroit that's got to stand up and help the Detroit that's going through trouble."

In this view, if state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr can bolster public safety and basic services, then the gains downtown could spread to other areas.

"We need jobs for people in the neighborhoods," said David Enger, director of a joint effort by 10 foundations committing more than $100 million to Detroit entrepreneurs. "But they can't be just any jobs - we need jobs for people with less of an employment record and a low skill base."

A big question is whether Orr can convince federal bankruptcy court to impose steep cuts on payments owed to creditors - including retired city pensioners represented by powerful unions. Their opposition to Orr's plans is certain to make the bankruptcy case long and expensive.

One thing that seems highly unlikely is any major new financial support from either the federal or Michigan state governments, if only because they will be reluctant to create a precedent. "If they bail out Detroit, other municipalities in trouble could argue that they should be bailed out too," said bankruptcy attorney Douglas Bernstein, of Plunkett Cooney in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills.

Orr said he can't plan on the basis there will be such help. "We are not expecting the cavalry to come charging in," he told Fox News Sunday. "We have to fix it because we dug the hole."

SPECTACULAR RISE

It wasn't always like this. In the half-century from 1900, Detroit's population increased six-fold as it attracted hundreds of thousands of people, many of them job-seekers from the rural South.

But in the 1970s, the city's Big Three automakers lost their dominance of an increasingly global business. America's auto manufacturing base, with new investments by foreign companies from Japan, Korea and Germany, shifted from Detroit to the South.

Meanwhile, the devastating 1967 race riot - the latest in a series stretching back more than a century to the U.S. Civil War - accelerated "white flight" and sparked an exodus of the black middle class to the suburbs.

With both residents and businesses fleeing the city, Detroit's tax base has eroded. Income taxes fell to $233 million in 2012 from $328 million in 2002.

Political corruption set in, and the city made pension and health care benefits promises to its workers that it didn't have the money to keep. Problems were exacerbated by under-investment in infrastructure and basic services, and the city government in many ways stopped functioning.

BANKRUPTCY A BEGINNING?

Before any metamorphosis of the Motor City can gain traction, the city will have to navigate through the Chapter 9 bankruptcy process.

The state law that created the emergency manager position grants Orr broad powers to tackle the city's $18.5 billion in long-term debt, repair its finances and position it for recovery.

In public statements before the bankruptcy filing, Orr had indicated bankruptcy would give him maximum leverage over creditors and enable him to free up money to begin new investment in infrastructure and public services.

That would help to build on the boomlet downtown, where residential occupancy rates stand above 95 percent, driven by an influx of companies and entrepreneurs. Plans for construction of a 3.3-mile light rail line along Woodward Avenue, the city's main artery, and a new bridge across the Detroit River to Canada, are seen as encouraging signs. Both projects have state funding.

Timothy Bryan, CEO of healthcare software developer GalaxE.Solutions, opened an office downtown three years ago. His firm employs 150 people here and plans to expand to 500 within the next two years in what he described as a "cost-effective" city where the rent is low and nearby universities, such as Detroit's Wayne State University and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, churn out well-educated graduates willing to work for much less because of the low cost of living. Local IT firms say they tend to pay software engineers as little as half the going rate in California's Silicon Valley.

"There is an opportunity to grow IT in downtown Detroit, and we think this is a very, very good place to invest our time and money," said Bryan.

Some of the younger workers who have moved here, or moved back, say downtown Detroit is a cool place to live because of the city's gritty urban cachet and they feel that they can stand out here more than in cities like New York and Los Angeles. New restaurants such as Slow's, a hip barbecue joint in the city's Corktown neighborhood, and a Whole Foods Market upscale supermarket, have sprung up to meet increasing demand.

"I feel for the first time in my life I am making a real difference by coming back to Detroit," said Sarah Brithinee, 26, chief executive of Wedit, which rents out digital cameras for wedding parties and edits the footage into videos. She returned to her hometown in 2011.

The biggest firm to move here is Quicken Loans, the online mortgage firm, whose co-founder and Detroit area native Dan Gilbert has bought up and leased a large number of office buildings, moved more than 9,000 employees downtown and set up a venture capital unit and business incubator for more than a dozen IT firms. The filing is not a surprise to Gilbert's team: "We did this knowing that a bankruptcy was inevitable" said Matt Cullen, CEO of Rock Ventures, the holding company for Gilbert's large portfolio of firms.

HEART ATTACK

A 15-minute drive and a world away from the Detroit that Edsel Ford II knows so well are the places like Brightmoor, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods, that illustrate the immensity of the tasks ahead.

Those among the 23,000 people of Brightmoor who pay taxes get little in return. Police are scarce despite the high rate of violent crime. Fires devastate because the hydrants don't work, and the fire department investigates only about one in five suspicious fires, according to city statistics.

"If you were to have a heart attack in my office, there's no way I'd call for an ambulance because you'd die," said Kirk Mayes, executive director of the Brightmoor Alliance, a local community group. "I'd load you in my car, speed to the hospital and hope we don't get a ticket on the highway."

One of the biggest problems for Orr and his team is that Detroit is geographically huge given its population of only 700,000. It is 139 square miles - big enough to encompass Manhattan, Boston and San Francisco combined - and downtown Detroit only represents about 5 percent of that, or roughly seven square miles.

It is not lost on residents of the city's poor black neighborhoods that they have yet to see the benefits of the downtown rebound. While Detroit's official unemployment rate is just over 10 percent, the actual rate is believed much higher because many people have given up looking for work.

"The city's African American community has been left out," said Reverend D. Alexander Bullock, a black pastor and local leader of Reverend Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Push Coalition. "It's great that downtown is doing well, but there has been significant under-investment in Detroit's neighborhoods."



headline: PREVIEW-San Jose and unions set for court battle over pensions
byline: By Jim Christie
8:31am EDT

largest city, San Jose, and its employee unions face off in court on Monday over public pension reforms in a case that has major implications for other local authorities in the state trying to rein in the costs of retirement benefits.

The lawsuit brought against the measure, led by San Jose's police union, shows how difficult it is for local governments to break benefit promises to current and past employees even when other public services are being cut to pay for them.

San Jose's pension overhaul in San Jose was promoted by Democratic Mayor Chuck Reed and approved by nearly 70 percent of voters in 2012 but city unions argue the move violates the rights of its members and is in breach of the California state constitution. They want the court to block the measure from going into effect and to maintain the current pension plan.

"If the unions prevail it will give local leaders elsewhere reason to pause. If Mayor Reed prevails, they may get even more ambitious in finding new ways to reduce pension outlays," said Larry Gerston, a political science professor at San Jose State University.

In recent decades, municipalities across the country have provided their workers with higher retirement benefits, both pensions and health coverage, often in lieu of pay increases. But this has often created a future burden for budgets, made worse in some cases by skipping payments into pension funds.

Two other California cities, Stockton and San Bernardino, last year filed for bankruptcy due to deep financial problems that include spiking pension costs.

Detroit's decision to file for bankruptcy on Thursday, the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy filing ever, was also partly related to the cost of pension and other post-retirement benefits for city employees.

San Jose's pension reform, which has not yet been adopted because of the lawsuit, does not reduce benefits already earned by employees, but would require them to either pay higher contributions to maintain current benefits or receive lower benefits.

It also requires new city employees to split pension contributions evenly with the city. San Jose, which has two pension funds, currently pays $8 toward pension benefits for every $3 contributed by its employees, according to Dave Low, a spokesman for the mayor.

Reed made tackling San Jose's pension spending, which rose to $245 million last year from $73 million in 2001, a priority. San Jose has had to slash other spending to help cover the costs and balance its budgets.

San Jose, Silicon Valley's biggest city, is starting to see its revenue pick up as its economy and real estate market strengthen, but Reed says city services could be back on the chopping block without the projected savings from the pension reform.

Savings from the measure will help balance San Jose's books in future years and restore services cut over the past decade in response to budget shortfalls, said Low.

A FLAWED MEASURE, UNIONS SAY

Unions for public employees don't see it that way.

"The mayor's initiative was flawed from the get-go because it pulls the rug out from employees who have worked hard, played by the rules and expected the city to keep its promise," said Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for Californians for Retirement Security, a coalition representing more than 1 million public employees.

"The foundation of California's public pension system for nearly a century is that pensions are a legally protected promise," Maviglio added.

The court hearing San Jose's case consolidated five lawsuits brought by two unions, individual employees and retirees.

The unions argue that any change in employee benefits needs to be negotiated and cannot just be imposed by the city.

Public sector unions in California say the law shields their pension benefits from changes as they are the property of employees tied to their compensation.

San Jose's public pensions are generous in comparison to others in California, which are already well above the country's average.

The average San Jose police officer and firefighter who retired in the past decade, and worked for 26 years, gets an annual pension of $100,000, while the average civilian city employee who retired in the past decade, and worked for 20 years, has an annual pension of $45,000, according to proponents of the city's pension reform measure.

The average yearly pension benefit for a member of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the pension system for state workers and scores of local government across the state, was around $29,000 in April.

The case is in Santa Clara County Superior Court, No. 1-12-CV-225926.



headline: Federal judge sets first hearing in Detroit bankruptcy case
byline: By Bernie Woodall
8:31am EDT

A federal court judge has set the first hearing in Detroit's bankruptcy case for Wednesday to take up the city emergency manager's request to put state lawsuits challenging the bankruptcy filing on hold.

U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Steven Rhodes agreed on Monday to the expedited hearing requested by emergency manager Kevyn Orr in response to a Michigan court judge's order for Orr to withdraw the Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing on state constitutional grounds.

If Orr's request is granted, top Michigan state officials, Orr and others would also be protected from litigation regarding Thursday's bankruptcy petition.

Detroit, a former manufacturing powerhouse and cradle of the U.S. automotive industry and Motown music, has struggled for decades as companies moved or closed, crime became rampant and its population shriveled by about 25 percent in the past decade to 700,000. The city's revenue failed to keep pace with spending, leading to years of budget deficits and a dependence on borrowing to stay afloat.

Concerned that retirement benefits will be slashed, Detroit retirees, workers and pension funds have been running to state court in Michigan's capital of Lansing in an effort to derail the biggest Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.

Pensioners could attempt to appeal to the federal district court any order by Judge Rhodes enforcing the stay of litigation against Detroit. But, because such an order would not be considered a final judgment under bankruptcy laws, the federal court could refuse to hear the appeal, said Stuart Gold, a Detroit-based bankruptcy lawyer at Gold Lange &amp; Majoros PC.

Ahead of Wednesday's bankruptcy court hearing, the heads of two of the city's public labor unions - the United Auto Workers and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 25 - scheduled a news conference for later on Monday to discuss alleged constitutional violations involving Detroit's bankruptcy petition.

Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina on Friday said the state law that allowed Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to approve the bankruptcy filing violated the Michigan Constitution. The governor cannot take actions that would violate constitutional protections for retirement benefits for public workers, she said.

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, acting on behalf of Snyder, filed an appeal with the state appeals court asking for immediate consideration. But the appeals court has not yet taken any action on the matter.

Aquilina on Monday morning adjourned a hearing in another case brought by city pension plans with no action taken. The pension plans asked for the proceedings to be postponed one week to July 29. The pension funds had filed an objection to an expedited hearing in federal bankruptcy court, according to a court document.

Legal experts have said they expect the federal judge to put state litigation on hold, allowing those plaintiffs to use the federal court to argue why Detroit should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy.

Orr on Friday said he suspected the city will face an eligibility fight, which would also include whether or not the city made a good faith effort to negotiate with creditors over its more than $18 billion of debt.

Judge Rhodes also set an August 2 hearing in federal court on Orr's motion on procedural matters, including deadlines, schedules, the assumption of leases and contracts, and the appointment of a retired employees' committee.

The historic bankruptcy filing roiled the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market on Friday, sending prices lower and yields higher on some bonds. But the market, where states and cities like Michigan and Detroit borrow money, settled down and was mostly steady on Monday.



headline: Federal judge halts new North Dakota abortion law, for now
byline: By Brendan O'Brien
8:31am EDT

A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked North Dakota's new abortion law, the most restrictive in the country because it prohibits ending a pregnancy once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks after conception.

Banning abortions as early as six weeks, or before fetal viability between 24 and 26 weeks of gestation, would bar nearly 90 percent of the abortions performed at the Red River Women's Clinic, the state's only abortion clinic, said its director, Tammi Kromenaker.

U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Hovland, in granting a preliminary injunction in response to a lawsuit filed by the clinic, wrote that the new law "is clearly an invalid and unconstitutional law based on the United States Supreme Court precedent in Roe v. Wade from 1973."

The law was to go into effect August 1.

In its lawsuit, Red River Women's Clinic had claimed the measure violates the U.S. Constitution and places the health of women in danger.

"We are very pleased," said Kromenaker. "The U.S. Supreme Court has said time and time again that you cannot ban abortion prior to viability."

Were the law to go into effect, the clinic would be forced to close, she added. The closest alternative clinics are 250 miles away in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

The law, approved in March, is among a host of restrictions on abortion passed this year by Republican-led state legislatures across the United States.

North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple, a Republican in a state where the party also controls the legislature, said in March that it was not clear if the law would be constitutional but that money should be provided by the state to defend it.

A dozen states have approved bans on most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but none have approved restrictions as strong as the ones enacted by North Dakota and Arkansas.

In March, Arkansas banned most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy. A federal judge blocked the law in May, at least temporarily.

President Barack Obama returns on Wednesday to an Illinois town that has been a touchstone for his plan to rebuild America's manufacturing sector, giving the first in a series of speeches that will set the tone for his fiscal battles with Congress in the fall.

The White House said the address in Galesburg, Ill. will lay out Obama's priorities in the face of a pair of expected fights with Republicans over raising the government's debt limit and the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins October 1.

"The President wants to talk about the issues that should be at the core of that debate," senior Obama advisor Dan Pfeiffer said in an email announcing the speech.

The speech signals Obama's plans to go on the offensive with his jobs message this summer after months of defending his administration, which has suffered recent setbacks in Congress and been accused of abuses by civil libertarians as well as conservatives.

Obama will introduce some new economic ideas this summer, Pfeiffer said, although it was not clear what those would be.

Galesburg, a town of about 30,000 people, lost more than 900 jobs after Maytag, now owned by Whirlpool Corp, announced in 2004 that it would shut down a refrigerator factory.

Then-Senator Obama met with workers, and spoke about them at the Democratic National Convention that year, when he first turned heads as a potential future presidential candidate.

He also gave a commencement address at Knox College in Galesburg in 2005 and mentioned the town's struggles in his State of the Union speech in 2010.

A Knox College study of what happened to the Maytag workers found that six years after the plant closed, the workers' median household income had dropped by $10,000, and 40 percent of those surveyed said they would never recover financially.

Most of them felt the "American Dream" was out of reach, according to study results published in 2011 by the Galesburg Register-Mail newspaper.

NEW IDEAS, FAMILIAR ARGUMENTS

Obama has often said jobs are his top priority, with unemployment remaining stubbornly high above 7 percent.

But he has spent much of his second term battling Republicans over other priorities such as gun control, immigration reform, and the roll-out of his landmark 2010 healthcare restructuring law.

The Democratic president also has been put on the defensive to explain government surveillance programs after a former U.S. government contractor leaked information about phone and email collection programs aimed at Americans as well as allies abroad.

His Galesburg address comes the week after the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in American history, in Detroit - a former manufacturing powerhouse and the historic center of the U.S. automotive industry.

Obama played a key role in helping to bail out the auto sector in 2009, but the White House is now struggling to determine how it can help Detroit get back on its feet financially.

Obama, who will give a number of similar speeches this summer, will present new ideas as well as some familiar arguments to seek the upper hand in the economic debate in his Galesburg address, Pfeiffer said.

He will give a second speech later on Wednesday at the University of Central Missouri, which runs an "Innovation Campus" to give accelerated training and internships to high school students focused on science, math and engineering.

Obama's message will be bolstered by addresses in Washington this week by senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and Gene Sperling, head of the National Economic Council, Pfeiffer said.

"The President thinks Washington has largely taken its eye off the ball on the most important issue facing the country," Pfeiffer said.

"Too many in Congress are trying to score political points, re-fight old battles, and trump up phony scandals," he said.

Obama has pitched economic ideas in his second term, including the development of a new network of manufacturing hubs, an infrastructure jobs program, investments in education and a hike in the minimum wage.

He has urged Congress to lower the corporate tax rate, particularly for manufacturers, and raise taxes on the rich.

But his ideas have fallen flat in Congress, especially the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Obama last visited Galesburg in 2011 during a bus tour of the Midwest where he also focused on jobs. The campaign-style tour came after that year's battle with Congress on spending and the debt ceiling, which resulted in a cut to the long-term U.S. credit rating and a hike in U.S. borrowing costs.

long public auction by authorities in Pennsylvania's financially distressed state capital, ending on Sunday with nearly $4 million in sales.

A dentist chair used by famed gambler, gunfighter and dentist John Henry "Doc" Holliday and a foot locker built for sharpshooter Annie Oakley were among the items sold by Harrisburg's government at the auction, which was handled by Guernsey's of New York City.

The items were amassed by former Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed using millions of dollars of public funds to stock a proposed Wild West museum that never opened to the public.

"There were skeptics who didn't believe they'd get that much," Arlan Ettinger, president of Guernsey's, said of the more than $3.9 million raised through the auction.

"It's not going to save the city, but it's a good amount and hopefully it's enough to settle some debt," Ettinger said.

City officials have not announced any specific plans for the money.

Harrisburg is burdened with more than $300 million in debt, much of which stems from a failed incinerator project.



headline: Legal wrangling shadows Detroit bankruptcy filing
byline: By Bernie Woodall
8:31am EDT

The tug of war over whether Detroit legally could file for municipal bankruptcy continues this week as the city seeks an initial hearing in U.S. federal court to put on hold challenges to the filing in Michigan court.

Concerned that retirement benefits will be slashed, Detroit retirees, workers and pension funds have been running to state court in Michigan's capital of Lansing in an effort to derail the biggest Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.

A Michigan state court judge on Monday morning adjourned a hearing in a case brought by city pension plans with no action taken. The pension plans asked for the proceedings to be postponed one week to July 29.

That follows an order issued in one of the other cases on Friday by the same judge, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, directing Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr to withdraw the bankruptcy petition he filed on Thursday.

In Friday's order Aquilina said the state law that allowed Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to approve the bankruptcy filing violated the Michigan Constitution. The governor cannot take actions that would violate constitutional protections for retirement benefits for public workers, she said.

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, acting on behalf of Snyder, filed an appeal with the state appeals court, which has not yet taken action on the matter.

Orr, meanwhile, filed a motion with Federal Bankruptcy Court Judge Steven Rhodes, who was appointed on Friday to oversee the Detroit case, requesting a hearing as soon as Tuesday on his request to put a hold on lawsuits aimed at stopping the city's Chapter 9 proceedings. The emergency manager's motion also asked the judge to rule on deadlines, schedules, notification lists and other procedural matters.

Legal experts have said they expect the federal judge to put state litigation on hold, allowing those plaintiffs to use the federal court to argue why Detroit should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy.

Orr on Friday said he suspected the city will face an eligibility fight, which would also include whether or not the city made a good faith effort to negotiate with creditors over its more than $18 billion of debt.

Detroit, a former manufacturing powerhouse and cradle of the U.S. automotive industry and Motown music, has struggled for decades as companies moved or closed, crime became rampant and its population shriveled by about 25 percent in the past decade to 700,000. The city's revenue failed to keep pace with pending, leading to years of budget deficits and a dependence on borrowing to stay afloat.

Heavy rains overnight helped slow a massive Southern California wildfire that had threatened the town of Idyllwild, a community about a mile above sea level known for its hiking trails, rock climbing and arts and music scene.

Evacuation orders for Idyllwild and nearby Fern Valley were lifted late Sunday morning, and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service said tourism businesses were expected to re-open by evening.

"Today the residents and business owners were able to go back home and tonight they'll open Idyllwild back up to all visitors so we can start business as usual and let people come up to that beautiful little community," spokeswoman Norma Bailey said.

The so-called Mountain Fire was 49 percent contained by Saturday night, up from 25 percent earlier in the day and 15 percent on Friday, Bailey said.

The blaze has burned across more than 27,000 acres of dry brush and timber and destroyed seven residences since it broke out last Monday.

The flames forced the evacuation of Idyllwild and nearby Fern Valley, about 90 miles east of Los Angeles, affecting about 6,000 residents, business owners and tourists, Bailey said.

At its peak, 3,478 firefighters were working to control the blaze, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Ten air tankers and 20 helicopters were also deployed in the effort.

down neighborhood.

East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton said that Michael Madison, 35 has been arrested as a suspect after authorities in the past two days found the bodies near the apartment building where the suspect lived. Neighbors' complaints of a "pungent" smell triggered the search.

The bodies, two of which were found by trained cadaver-smelling dogs, were located in a garage, the basement of a building and in a weeded lot around the building where Madison lived.

Madison is a registered sex offender who pleaded guilty to attempted rape in 2002 according to Cuyahoga County court records. He was arrested after a stand-off at his mother's home not far from the crime scene Saturday. He is now in an East Cleveland jail.

The bodies were "in states of advanced decomposition," the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office said in a statement, adding, "Because of this, identification and final cause of death may take several days."

The discoveries were reminiscent of a 2009 incident, when 11 bodies were found around the home of Cleveland's Anthony Sowell, who was convicted of murder two years later.

Volunteers turned out the area on Sunday at police request to search empty lots and vacant buildings in the area.

Clifford Burns, a pastor from Anointed Gates Church in the east side of Cleveland, one of the organizers, said he expected hundreds of volunteers to help search the many deserted properties.

"It was a request by the mayor and the police last evening," Burns said. "They requested on a volunteer basis that people meet at noon and join in a search party. We have a lot of concerns in the neighborhood."

Velvet Farmer, 21, said she has a cousin who lives on the street and had spoken to Madison, who told her his name was "Ivan," a few times and he seemed normal.

She said she was shocked to learn he is a suspect adding, "I'm glad to be alive."

Burns said neighbors complained of the stench and eventually the fire department came to investigate. "The smell was pungent," Burns, a former member of the military who says he is familiar with the smell of decay, told Reuters.

"It was bad and he (Madison) didn't have a sausage shop to blame for it," Burns added, referring to the Ray's Sausage shop the business next door to Sowell's house that was often blamed for a foul odor in the area.



headline: Firefighters have California blaze nearly half contained
byline: By Alex Dobuzinskis
8:31am EDT

Cooler weather helped firefighters make significant gains on Saturday against a massive wildfire in Southern California, as crews cut containment lines around nearly 50 percent of the blaze.

The so-called Mountain Fire has burned across more than 27,000 acres of dry brush and timber and destroyed seven residences since it broke out on Monday. At least 5,600 residents remain under evacuation orders.

The more than 3,000 firefighters tackling the blaze on Saturday managed to expand containment lines to encircle 49 percent of the fire, up from 25 percent earlier in the day, said Carol Jandrall, fire information officer for the multiagency team battling the conflagration.

"It's been probably the best day so far," she said of the progress made on Saturday.

Higher humidity and clouds, which reduced sunlight on the burn area and tempered the intensity of the flames, helped firefighters cut more containment lines along the east and south flanks of the fire where it originated, Jandrall said.

Firefighters had hoped for rain, but little precipitation actually fell, she said. At the same time, the erratic winds that can propel a fire and had been feared as the weather changed also did not materialize, Jandrall said.

The flames have forced the evacuation of the town of Idyllwild, a community about a mile above sea level known for its hiking trails, rock climbing, and arts and music scene, and also forced out residents from the nearby community of Fern Valley.

Residents of Idyllwild and Fern Valley have been out of their homes since evacuations were ordered on Wednesday.

A few hundred people have been allowed to return home in neighboring areas where the threat of flames has decreased, said Norma Bailey, a spokeswoman for the team combating the blaze.

The Mountain Fire is 90 miles east of Los Angeles.

Conditions could improve on Sunday, Jandrall said.

"They are expecting a chance for more precipitation which would be great," she said.



headline: Red Cross talking to Colombian rebels about release of U.S. captive
byline: By Peter Murphy and Monica Garcia
8:31am EDT

The International Committee of the Red Cross is talking to Colombia's FARC rebels about handing over a former U.S. marine seized by the Marxist group in a jungle region after he set out on a solitary trek despite police warnings about its dangers.

Kevin Scott Sutay, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, was captured on June 20 as he walked, apparently alone, toward El Retorno in Colombia's dangerous southeast, an area with little infrastructure and dense jungle canopy that provides cover for rebel fighters. The FARC has pledged to release Sutay.

A police source told Reuters that Sutay was thoroughly warned by the police command of San Jose del Guaviare, about 278 km (173 miles) from the capital, Bogota, of the risks posed by the trip he discussed openly. Sutay planned to travel to the hamlet of El Retorno by navigating through the jungle with a GPS device and survival skills learned in the military.

The FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, posted details of Sutay's passport in a statement on Friday, describing him as a mine clearance expert from New York. The U.S. government confirmed he was a citizen and said he was a tourist in Colombia with no current ties to the armed forces.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was also in contact with the Colombian government, the U.S. embassy in Bogota and Piedad Cordoba, a left-wing former senator who has been involved in several high-profile captive releases at the FARC's request.

The FARC began as a communist agrarian movement in 1964 and has fought the government ever since in what is now Latin America's longest-running insurgency. It has said it intends to release Sutay as a gesture of goodwill amid peace talks with the government hosted by Cuba that have been under way since last November.

"At the moment we are making contact but there is nothing more concrete to say," said Colombia-based Red Cross spokesman Edgar Alfonso, who added that the organization would only give further details about Sutay's release once it had taken place.

The police command in San Jose del Guaviare told Sutay that the area was considered a "red zone" because of the rebel presence and asked him to sign a document written in English which acknowledged the risks of the journey he was intent upon making, after which he set off, the source said.

People who had seen Sutay questioned whether he was in a sound state of mind, the police source said. He also apparently left without paying his bill at the hotel where he had been staying in San Jose del Guaviare, the source said. Reuters could not immediately confirm whether he had paid his hotel bill.

Even though the 8,000-strong FARC has been weakened by a decade-long U.S.-backed offensive, last month's kidnapping, in tandem with a weekend of heavy military losses, prove the group is still a force to be reckoned with.

Nineteen soldiers were killed in two separate clashes with the FARC on Saturday, the deadliest of which was in Arauca province near the Venezuelan border, where rebels attacked soldiers guarding an oil pipeline under construction. Four troops were killed in a separate attack in the south in which six FARC guerrillas were also killed.

story roller coaster Friday at the Six Flags Over Texas amusement park outside Dallas fell from the car she was riding in, local police who are investigating the incident said on Sunday.

The Dallas Morning News said the victim had been identified by family members as Rosy Esparza, a Dallas resident, but other details were not immediately available.

Police in Arlington, Texas, located about 20 miles west of Dallas, said there was no evidence that the death of the woman resulted from criminal intent.

"At this point of the investigation, it does not appear that there was any foul play or criminality associated with this tragic incident," Arlington police said in a statement.

At the time that it opened in 1990, the Texas Giant ride was promoted as the tallest wooden roller coaster in the world.

The wooden tracks were replaced in 2010 with steel but the original wooden support structure was kept and the lift hill was elevated 10 feet, according to the Six Flags Entertainment Corp website.

Six Flags spokeswoman Sharon Parker said the company was investigating the incident.

"We are committed to determining the cause of this tragic accident and will utilize every resource throughout this process," Parker said.



headline: In Detroit's ruin, law firms see land of new opportunity

including some advisers not exactly known for municipal work.

The city, which filed the largest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy on Thursday, tapped high-priced lawyers from Jones Day, financial advisers from Ernst &amp; Young and restructuring consultants from Conway MacKenzie, court papers show.

For creditors and related parties, there is clearly a lot at stake. That means bondholders, insurers, retirees and others are sure to be accompanied in court by platoons of lawyers.

Detroit owes more than $8 billion in bond debt, and the insurers likely on the hook for those costs have already retained big-name law firms to take their cases.

Federal Guaranty Insurance Co tapped Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges, according to a source close to the matter, who declined to be named because the information was not public as of Saturday. An attorney for Weil declined to comment.

David Dubrow, a lawyer at Arent Fox, confirmed on Saturday that he has been tapped by Ambac Financial Group.

And, according to the court's electronic docket, Syncora hired Kirkland &amp; Ellis, known for its corporate bankruptcy work, while Assured Guaranty retained Winston &amp; Strawn, and National Public Finance Guarantee Corp hired Sidley Austin.

Bond insurers will play a key role in Detroit's case. While a portion of the city's $1.13 billion in general obligation bonds are secured by city assets, about $651 million of it is secured only by the ability to raise taxes. The city's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, has said he will treat that portion of the debt as an unsecured claim.

That classification, which has been largely untested in federal courts, is likely to be hotly contested and possibly litigated by bondholders or their insurers.

Detroit also owes $5.7 billion in unfunded healthcare and other benefits to retirees, and has asked the judge to form a committee to look out for their interests. The Department of Justice may also appoint a committee of unsecured creditors in the case. Both moves would mean opportunities for professional advisers.

The city needs to negotiate new labor deals with unions, and its pension funds are underfunded by $3.5 billion, providing yet more opportunities for attorneys to advise creditors.

Chapter 9, the section of the bankruptcy code that governs municipal bankruptcies, is attractive for advisers, provided there is money to pay them. Unlike in Chapter 11, where billing is subject to court and regulatory review, Chapter 9 allows bills to stay between the adviser and its client.

In corporate restructurings, creditors, judges and the Justice Department pore over fees line by line, and can raise objections to unnecessary or overpriced items. Over the past few years, the Justice Department has ramped up its policing of high fees and has required bankruptcy lawyers to disclose more.

In municipal bankruptcies, fees could be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, but they do not need to be reported publicly in court.

"You're used to being in a world where you have to explain yourself, and suddenly you don't anymore," said a bankruptcy lawyer, who asked not to be named.

The catch is that, unlike in corporate bankruptcies, there is no mechanism under Chapter 9 to make the bankrupt entity pay certain creditors' fees. And corporate bankruptcies are generally more lucrative for advisers because there is often more money to go around.

But with $18.5 billion in debt, Detroit is an outlier among municipal bankruptcies, where advisers see the potential for high fees without the hassle of having to justify them in court.

A NEW FRONTIER

In the past, only a small handful of professionals were known for having expertise in municipal restructuring. But a recent slew of Chapter 9 filings has yielded many new faces, and Detroit's bankruptcy will only continue that trend.

"Every time a case gets bigger, there are new players," said Richard Levin, a partner at Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore who is representing the Detroit Institute of Arts in the restructuring.

Chapter 9 filings are rare, with only about 650 cases filed in the 75 years to 2012, mostly involving small municipal entities like sewer districts. But, the last three years have seen filings by the city of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Jefferson County, Alabama and the California cities of Stockton and San Bernardino.

And a concurrent lull in corporate bankruptcies has put strain on big restructuring firms like Weil Gotshal, which last month laid off 170 associates and support staff, driving professionals toward municipal work.

"Chapter 9 is not something I started out doing," said George South, a partner at DLA Piper who has become well-versed in the arena, representing creditor groups in the bankruptcies of both Harrisburg and Jefferson County.

PLENTY OF CONSTITUENCIES

In addition to general obligation bonds, Detroit owes nearly $6 billion in revenue bonds and $1.43 billion in pension certificates. Even though the bond insurers are likely to be the ones on the hook, the bondholders themselves will also "lawyer up."

Subsets of the holders may even band together to form committees if they feel a united front would better serve their interests, providing yet another potential path for advisers.

A number of other large law firms, including Brown Rudnick, Orrick Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe and DLA Piper, are involved in the case or looking for ways in, according to people familiar with the matter.

Even if advisers lose out on big-money clients, Detroit's restructuring calls for a slew of projects and transactions that will require their own armies of professionals.

"There's all kinds of consulting opportunities," said Levin, whose client, the Detroit Institute of Arts museum, is at the center of a dispute over whether the city can sell the museum's art collection.

Orr, the emergency manager, has outlined in court papers his plans to create a new water and sewer management authority, transfer Detroit's Belle Isle Park to the state of Michigan, and restructure Coleman A. Young airport, which has not serviced commercial jets in 13 years but which the city must maintain to keep some federal subsidies.

Each of those moves will require lawyers, consultants and financial advisers to strategize the most cost-efficient execution, said Kenneth Klee, a Chapter 9 expert and bankruptcy lawyer at Klee Tuchin Bogdanoff &amp; Stern.

"Chapter Nines require complete expertise in the area of municipal finance," Klee said. "If you only have bankruptcy expertise, that's not enough."

Eventually, hedge funds and other investment vehicles could find ways into the case, as Orr has stressed the importance of new investment, particularly with respect to the proposed new water and sewer authority, which could finance its operations with new bond issuance.

The case could be a boon for smaller law firms, too.

While large, corporate creditors are apt to tap similarly colossal law firms with whom they have preexisting relationships, smaller or locally-based stakeholders may opt to hire attorneys native to Detroit.

"There are a lot of talented lawyers in Detroit," Levin said. "I would think pensions and unions, for example, might opt for those guys."

byline: By Sharon Bernstein
8:31am EDT

Police in Lubbock, Texas, on Sunday were investigating a runaway teenager's charge that she was held captive for six weeks and sexually assaulted by several men.

The girl, whose name was not released, ran away from her home in the West Texas city of Amarillo and met up with one of the men, Lubbock Police Captain Jon Caspell said.

It was not clear, Caspell said, whether she went with the man willingly to Lubbock, about 125 miles away. But once there, her claims that he assaulted her and kept her against her will appear to be valid, Caspell said.

"We believe we have strong evidence that she has been sexually assaulted probably multiple times because of this abduction," Caspell said.

No one has been arrested in the case, but two men have been brought in for questioning and another was detained on an unrelated warrant, Caspell said.

The girl, who is under the age of 16, told police she managed to escape from where she was being held by climbing out of a window on Friday. She told police she then ran to a nearby McDonald's and phoned them.

On Saturday afternoon, the girl led police to the house where she had been held. Her account also raised concerns that there might be another victim, Caspell said, so police are investigating that possibility, as well.

The girl remains in protective care, and police have contacted her mother.

Kidnapping and aggravated assault charges could be filed against one or more of the men questioned in the case as soon as Monday, Caspell said.

headline: Out of prison, former HealthSouth CEO Scrushy seeks redemption
byline: By Jonathan Stempel and Verna Gates
8:31am EDT

Freed from federal prison but still owing more than $2 billion to the company he once ran, former HealthSouth Corp Chief Executive Richard Scrushy is trying to make a comeback. Not everyone wishes him success.

Scrushy said he has been talking to entrepreneurs and bankers about business opportunities in healthcare, while at the same time trying to persuade a federal judge that he is fit to serve as an officer or director of a public company.

The 60-year-old has been out of prison for more than a year, following his 2006 bribery conviction for paying $500,000 to former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman's campaign for a state lottery in exchange for a seat on a state hospital regulatory board. He spent about five years in federal custody.

In 2005, he had been acquitted of criminal charges that he orchestrated a $2.6 billion accounting fraud at HealthSouth, a medical rehabilitation company based in Birmingham, Alabama, that he founded in 1984.

Two years later, he resolved civil charges related to HealthSouth, without admitting wrongdoing, in a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that included an officer and director ban which Scrushy now wants lifted.

An Alabama state judge found Scrushy, who is an ordained minister, liable for fraud in a civil, non-jury trial in 2009 and ordered him to pay HealthSouth $2.88 billion.

HealthSouth said less than $100 million has been repaid. It firmly opposes lifting the SEC ban.

"There are those whose past actions have been so abhorrent, their abuse of power so extreme, the damage inflicted on the innocent so great, that never again should they be put in a position to repeat them," the company said in a July 3 court filing. "Richard Scrushy is one of those individuals."

In phone interviews last week, Scrushy said the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, had created a period of opportunity in the healthcare industry.

He declined to discuss specifics, saying he didn't want to divulge competitive strategies.

"I don't know whether I'd want to be a CEO," said Scrushy, who now lives and works in Houston. "But I know there are a lot of young guys and girls out there that I have talked to that I certainly wouldn't mind helping."

But Scrushy said the officer and director ban is holding him back. He said that when he tried to discuss business ideas with a financial firm last year, he was told he could not get financing while the officer and director ban was in place.

So in May, he asked a federal judge in Alabama to lift the ban.

NOT "ONE SHRED"

Scrushy's criminal trial over HealthSouth was considered one of the first big courthouse tests of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley corporate reforms passed after the collapse of the energy giant Enron Corp.

Jurors said they found a lack of hard evidence, or any "smoking gun," to tie Scrushy to the alleged scheme to inflate HealthSouth's earnings and assets from 1996 to 2002.

But in imposing the $2.88 billion civil judgment, the presiding judge in that case found that Scrushy was "the CEO of the fraud."

In a court filing last month, the SEC said it "absolutely opposes" lifting the officer and director ban. It said the Alabama judge's findings made the case for a ban even stronger.

Scrushy "is unfit to manage funds raised through the sale of securities to the general public," the SEC said.

Scrushy still forcefully denies having done anything wrong at HealthSouth, and blames subordinates for its troubles.

"I didn't lie. I haven't lied. There isn't one shred of evidence against me," he said. "I will not accept responsibility for the fraud, because I was not in it."

TWO SIDES

Scrushy has his supporters. John Edwards, a longtime friend and former preacher who owns a carpet cleaning company in Moody, Alabama, recalls Scrushy having been "scared to death" as the two prayed just before the prison term began.

"He would tell me 'I swear to God, I didn't do it,' and I believe him," said Edwards. "I did not see the side of him other people saw. He was friendly to me. And I had nothing to give him. I was just a redneck preacher out in the woods."

In contrast, Rev. Herman Henderson, a pastor at the Believer's Temple Church in Birmingham, said Scrushy went back on an agreement to pay him and other African-American pastors to show support at his 2005 trial. Scrushy has denied ever authorizing such payments.

"He should not be allowed back into the business," Henderson said last Wednesday. "God showed him. He got what he deserved."

Before his legal troubles, Scrushy had owned multiple homes, luxury cars, boats and planes, but many were auctioned to help satisfy the civil judgment requiring him to repay HealthSouth.

Scrushy said that "all that I can do, I have done" with regard to satisfying the judgment.

The federal bribery conviction against Scrushy also stands, and on July 15 an appeals court rejected his contentions that juror and judicial bias warranted a new trial. Scrushy said he may appeal that decision.

Known for his charisma, Scrushy said learning "how to do time" in prison was a big change.

"You have to calm down, you have to relax, you have to slow down your life, you have to learn how to be patient. They'll punish 600 men when one guy does something stupid," he said.

While in prison, Scrushy, who is married and has nine children, said he conducted Bible studies and taught business classes to fellow inmates.

"There are certainly a lot of moral things that you obviously learn as you read Scripture and teach Scripture," he said. "In your business dealings you always want to be fair and above board and honest and ethical."



headline: Candidates for governor of Virginia go on offensive in debate
byline: By Gary Robertson
8:31am EDT

Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Ken Cuccinelli, running against each other for the Virginia governership, attacked each other on Saturday in their first debate, but both agreed the current governor should consider resigning over a gifts scandal.

Cuccinelli, currently attorney general of Virginia, called his opponent self-serving and McCauliffe fired back that the Republican was intolerant of gays and too socially conservative.

Both candidates agreed on one thing though - that current Virgnia Governor Bob McDonnell, a Republican, should consider resigning, as questions mount about gifts that McDonnell has acknowledged were given to his family by a business executive.

Cuccinelli said that in his position as attorney general he began a state investigation of McDonnell and that as a result could not actually call for the governor's resignation.

"I think while that question is appropriate to ask Governor McDonnell and it's appropriate to ask him to think about that (resigning), I don't think it's appropriate for the sitting attorney general to address it when I started one of the investigations," he said.

McCauliffe said "only governor McDonnell knows the facts" and added: "I don't think I should call for his resignation." However, the Democrat also said: "I would agree with the attorney general he should consider it."

While the question about whether the governor should considering resigning from moderator Judy Woodruff of the Public Broadcasting Service stirred the audience, the candidates spent most of their 90-minute debate attacking each other.

Cuccinelli, the state's attorney general, labeled McAuliffe, a former national Democratic Party chairman, as a Washington insider focused on his own self-interests.

"Instead of putting Virginians first, you put Terry first," Cuccinelli said.

McAuliffe responded that Cuccinelli's social views opposing abortion and same-sex marriage would not help make Virginia more friendly to business.

He charged that Cuccinelli had once referred to gays as "soulless human beings," and that his opponent was "the true Trojan horse of Virginia politics."

The debate, sponsored by the Virginia State Bar, was held at the plush Omni Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia.

The Washington Post has reported that Jonnie Williams Sr., chief executive of Star Scientific Inc dietary supplement company, paid for $15,000 in catering services at the 2011 wedding of Governor McDonnell's daughter, $15,000 in clothing for the governor's wife during a New York shopping trip and a $6,000 Rolex watch that the governor's wife gave to her husband.

McDonnell has said he did not disclose the gifts in state disclosure filings because Virginia state law does not require state public officials to account for gifts to family members.

Investors dumped Detroit's municipal bonds a day after the city's historic bankruptcy filing even as a ruling in state court raised questions about whether the bankruptcy will stand up to court review.

Attempts by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and Detroit's Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr to put a positive spin on the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history failed to reassure investors. Prices on some Detroit bonds plunged and there were wider declines in the $3.7 trillion U.S. municipal bond market.

The state court judge in Michigan's capital of Lansing ordered Orr to withdraw the bankruptcy petition because the state law that allowed Snyder to approve the bankruptcy violated the Michigan Constitution. The governor lacks the power to "diminish or impair pension benefits," according to the ruling by Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina.

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, acting on behalf of Snyder, quickly filed an appeal with the state appeals court. His office said motions seeking emergency consideration were expected to be filed later on Friday.

Orr, meanwhile, filed a motion with Federal Bankruptcy Court Judge Steven Rhodes, who was appointed on Friday to oversee the Detroit case, requesting a hearing as soon as Tuesday on his request to place lawsuits aimed at derailing the city's Chapter 9 proceedings on hold. The emergency manager's motion also asked the judge to rule on deadlines, schedules, notification lists and other procedural matters.

Ken Klee, a bankruptcy lawyer at Klee, Tuchin, Bogdanoff &amp; Stern LLP, said the Judge Aquilina's orders could be coming too late in the Detroit bankruptcy case.

"The state judge could not order Detroit to dismiss the case or Kevyn Orr to dismiss it, because once it's filed the automatic stay under the bankruptcy code kicks in, to protect the city and its employees from lawsuits," he said.

Neither Snyder nor Orr could necessarily be compelled to withdraw the city's petition at this juncture, he added.

Orr, who was appointed by Snyder in March to try to resolve the city's financial crisis and tackle its $18.5 billion in long-term debt, acknowledged that court battles over the need for a bankruptcy filing could be protracted and difficult.

A first test in a Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceeding is whether the city has explored other reasonable options before filing, and the city will "have an eligibility fight, I suspect" over the decision, Orr said.

In the bankruptcy filing, Orr stated he has set an objective to conclude the bankruptcy process no later than September 2014.

"I've got 15 months left on my tenure," Orr said. "I promised the governor that we were going to try and get this done within the time frame provided by the statute."

Judge Rhodes of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan was assigned to oversee the Detroit case, which involves thousands of creditors. Bankruptcy experts expect the case could last years and cost tens of millions of dollars.

Under the 2012 Michigan law that created the emergency manager position, Orr's term is limited to 18 months, after which he can be removed by a two-thirds vote of Detroit's city council.

Detroit, a former manufacturing powerhouse and cradle of the U.S. automotive industry and Motown music, has struggled for decades as companies moved or closed, crime became rampant and its population shriveled by about 25 percent in the past decade to 700,000.

Under the state law that created the emergency manager position, Detroit could not file for bankruptcy without the governor's approval. Lawsuits by pension funds and city workers, filed earlier this month, had sought to prevent a filing. But on Thursday, Orr filed the bankruptcy petition, with Snyder's permission, just minutes before Judge Aquilina was set to rule on a petition to stop the process.

In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Snyder sidestepped the constitutional question.

"That's a matter in litigation and we have very good attorneys who I'm sure are on top of that," he said

The governor has sought to paint the bankruptcy filing as a positive move for the city and the state.

"We're the comeback state in Michigan, but to be a great state we need...Detroit on the path to being a great city again," Snyder, a Republican, said at a press conference.

Snyder acknowledged that the bankruptcy would be seen as a new low point for the city, but said, "This is the day to stabilize Detroit."

Orr addressed concerns that art works at the Detroit Institute of Arts or other city assets would be auctioned off to pay off creditors, who have been offered pennies on the dollar.

"Right now, there's nothing for sale," he said.

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden told reporters on Friday that White House officials had been briefed on Detroit's situation, but that it was unclear what help the administration could provide.

In the state court proceeding on Friday, Judge Aquilina said she plans to keep the White House informed on matters affecting pensions by sending her rulings in the state cases to President Barack Obama, according to her law clerk, and attorney William Wertheimer, who is representing retirees in a lawsuit.

A woman died on Friday following an accident on a roller coaster at the Six Flags Over Texas amusement park in Arlington, the park operator said.

The unidentified woman was riding the Texas Giant roller coaster ride at the park in Arlington, about 20 miles west of Dallas, when the accident occurred, Six Flags said in a statement.

"Since the safety of our guests and employees is our number one priority, the ride has been closed pending further investigation," Six Flags spokeswoman Sharon Parker said.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends during this difficult time," she added.

Parker gave no further details of the accident.

At the time that it opened in 1990, the Texas Giant ride was promoted as the tallest wooden roller coaster in the world.

The wooden tracks were replaced in 2010 with steel but the original wooden support structure was kept and the lift hill was elevated 10 feet, according to the Six Flags website.

In a separate incident at an amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, seven people were injured on Friday evening when a boat ride they were on slipped backwards on a lift.

The Cedar Point amusement park said in a statement the ride attendants stopped the Shoot the Rapids water ride when the accident occurred on the ride's first hill.

Six of the seven riders were treated at the park by emergency responders and released. One passenger was taken to a hospital with unknown injuries and later released, the park said. Cedar Point is located about 60 miles west of Cleveland.

The ride will remain closed until the Ohio Department of Agriculture, which regulates amusement rides, completes its investigation.



headline: Firefighters gain more control over Southern California blaze

8:31am EDT

Crews working to contain a massive wildfire in Southern California on Saturday were hoping cooler weather and possible rain showers would help them gain the upper hand against a blaze that has forced the evacuation of 5,600 residents.

The so-called Mountain Fire was 25 percent contained on Saturday, up from 15 percent the day before, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.

The fire has burned across more than 27,000 acres of dry brush and timber and destroyed seven residences since it broke out on Monday.

The flames have forced the evacuation of the town of Idyllwild, a community about a mile above sea level known for its hiking trails, rock climbing and arts and music scene, and also forced out residents from the nearby community of Fern Valley.

A total of 3,478 firefighters were working to control the blaze, according to Cal Fire. Ten air tankers and 20 helicopters were also deployed against it.

Rain was falling in the region about 90 km east of Los Angeles on Saturday and firefighters were hopeful it would fall in the burn areas, said Norma Bailey, a spokeswoman for the multiple agencies handling the fire.

But thunder and lightning accompanied the same change in weather that brought the rain and firefighters were concerned about the possibility for erratic winds, Bailey said. Wind speeds of up to 10 miles per hour (16 km/h) with gusts of 15 mph (24 km/h) have been predicted.

Residents of Idyllwild and Fern Valley have been out of their homes since evacuations were ordered on Wednesday.

A few hundred people have been allowed to return home in neighboring areas where the threat of flames has decreased, Bailey said.



headline: Longtime White House reporter Helen Thomas dies
byline: By Vicki Allen and Bill Trott
8:31am EDT

Former White House correspondent Helen Thomas, a trailblazing journalist who reported on every U.S. president from John Kennedy to Barack Obama, died on Saturday at the age of 92, the Gridiron Club and Foundation said.

Thomas, who broke many barriers for female journalists during her 49 years on the White House beat for United Press International and Hearst newspapers and died after a long illness, the Washington journalists' organization said in a statement.

As the senior news service correspondent at the White House, Thomas ended dozens of presidential news conferences with the familiar phrase "Thank you, Mr. President."

She was known for her straight-to-the-point questioning of presidents and press secretaries in a manner that some considered dogged. Others, including many fellow reporters, considered her style in her later years to be too combative and agenda-driven.

President Barack Obama in a statement praised "her fierce belief that our democracy works best when we ask tough questions and hold our leaders to account," and noted that in her long tenure Thomas "never failed to keep presidents - myself included - on their toes."

Former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, praised her as "a pioneering journalist" who added "more than her share of cracks to the glass ceiling."

In the last 10 years of her career Thomas was a columnist for Hearst, a job that allowed her opinions to surface more than in her work as a hard-news reporter for UPI.

Thomas announced in June 2010 that she was retiring from Hearst, effective immediately, after comments she made about Israel and the Palestinians, including that Israel should "get the hell out of Palestine," were captured on videotape and widely disseminated on the Internet.

Thomas later issued a statement: "I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians. They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance. May that day come soon."

Thomas believed the Washington media had grown soft and was reluctant to challenge government, views she shared in her 2007 book "Watchdogs of Democracy? The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public."

She was especially rough on former President George W. Bush, whom in 2003 she described as the "worst president ever," and the Iraq war, which she felt the media had abetted by not challenging Bush strongly enough on it.

In 2009 she asked Obama: "When are you going to get out of Afghanistan? Why are we continuing to kill and die there? What is the real excuse? And don't give us this Bushism 'If we don't go there, they'll all come here.'"

Veteran NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell on Saturday tweeted that Thomas "made it possible for all of us who followed," and Dana Perino, press secretary for George W. Bush, tweeted, "First day I ever took the podium she came to encourage me."

DEAN OF WHITE HOUSE MEDIA CORPS

Thomas was often combative in dealing with the White House, particularly when she felt she was being denied access. Reuters White House reporter Steve Holland recalled that early one morning during Clinton's presidency, she was spotted kicking the locked door to the White House press office, demanding to speak to the staff.

Thomas grew up in Detroit, the daughter of Lebanese immigrants, and will be buried in that city. Middle Eastern affairs were a strong interest and the impromptu comments about Israel and the Palestinians in May 2010 were her undoing.

Asked by an interviewer from the website rabbilive.com if she had any comments about Israel, Thomas responded, "Get the hell out of Palestine." She said Jews should "go home, to Poland and Germany, America and everywhere else."

After the interview spread on the Internet, her comments were criticized by the White House, the White House Correspondents' Association, the co-author of one of her books and the agency that handled her speaking engagements, among others. Shortly after, she announced her retirement, two months short of her 90th birthday.

Thomas established a number of firsts for women journalists in becoming one of Washington's best known reporters. She was the first woman officer in the White House Correspondents Association in its 50-year history, becoming its first woman president. In 1975, she broke the 90-year all-male barrier at the Gridiron Club, an organization of leading Washington journalists, and became its first female president in 1993.

She also supported scores of women starting out in the news business.

Thomas's career began as a copy girl on the Washington Daily News and she joined what was then known as United Press in 1943. She was assigned to the White House in 1961 in part because of the great interest in first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, as well as the new young president. She became UPI White House bureau chief in 1974, the first woman to head a wire service bureau there. She stayed in that position until 2000 when she joined Hearst.

Thomas first came to public notice during the Watergate era when she started receiving late-night phone calls from Martha Mitchell, the wife of Attorney General John Mitchell, discussing the scandal.

"I have witnessed presidents in situations of great triumph and adulation, when they are riding the crest of personal fulfillment, and I have seen them fall off their pedestals through an abuse of power or what President Clinton called 'a lapse of critical judgment,'" she wrote in her memoir "Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times."

Thomas married a professional rival, Douglas Cornell of the Associated Press, in 1971. He died in 1982.



headline: Colorado wrestles with gun control one year after theater shooting
byline: By Keith Coffman
8:31am EDT

Stephen Barton was settling into his seat at a Colorado movie theater a year ago to enjoy with friends the midnight screening of the latest Batman film, "The Dark Knight Rises," when he heard a popping sound inside the cinema.

"I thought it was fireworks until I felt this immense pressure on my chest," the 23-year-old recalled.

Barton was struck in the face, arm and neck by buckshot unleashed by a heavily armed gunman, and still bears the scars from entry wounds and surgical incisions.

Soon the rapid bursts of gunfire were followed by the wail of police and ambulance sirens, the screams of victims and the grief of a state that has endured two of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history.

Fifteen miles from Aurora, Colorado, is Columbine High School, where in 1999 two armed students killed a teacher, 12 students and themselves.

In a matter of hours after the July 20, 2012, movie theater shooting, Aurora, like Columbine, would become shorthand for a U.S. shooting rampage.

When the smoke cleared in the suburban Denver community, the grim reality set in. Former University of Colorado graduate student James Holmes, was charged with killing 12 moviegoers and wounding 58 others, some maimed and paralyzed.

Twelve others were injured fleeing the theater in what Barton described as "a chaotic scene."

Holmes, now 25, who surrendered meekly to police moments after the shooting ended, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder.

Prosecutors will seek the death penalty for the California native if he is convicted at his trial, which is scheduled to begin in February 2014.

COPING WITH HEARTBREAK

Ahead of Saturday's anniversary of the rampage, gun control activists staged a vigil on Friday at a Colorado park. They are reading the names of thousands of gun violence victims from across the country, ending at 12:38 p.m. local time on Saturday, the moment gunfire erupted in the theater.

A gun rights group lobby rallied nearby to protest what they called the exploitation of the tragedy for political gain.

In the year since the shootings, some victims have mourned privately, while others, like Tom Sullivan, have become public faces of the tragedy.

Sullivan's 27-year-old son, Alex, was sitting in row 12 of the theater when the gunfire erupted. A single bullet pierced his vital organs, killing him instantly.

"One minute he was watching the movie, the next he was dead," Tom Sullivan said in an interview.

Sullivan formed a non-profit organization, Aurora Rise, to raise money to help victims of the rampage and to keep Alex's memory alive.

"I am trying to get the message out that this could happen to your son," the retired postal worker said.

The theater shootings, along with the massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, five months later, reignited a national gun-control debate.

Gun-rights advocates argued vigorously passing more legislation restricting access to firearms violated their constitutional right to bear arms and criminals by definition did not abide by laws.

Advocates of gun control have clamored for curbs including background checks on gun purchasers and a ban on sales of powerful assault weapons of the kind used in both the Aurora and Connecticut shootings.

While the U.S. Congress failed to pass gun-control legislation after the shootings, Colorado lawmakers passed a series of gun-control measures - although not without a political price.

Two Democratic state legislators who supported the new laws face possible ouster after gun-rights supporters gathered enough voter signatures to force recall elections in September.

Barton took the opportunity to use his unwanted fame to become involved with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's organization, Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

The group is touring the country by bus to promote the need for gun-control legislation at the federal level.

"Thousands of Americans have been murdered with firearms since last July but our gun laws remain dangerously lax and loophole-ridden," said Barton, the group's outreach and policy associate. "How many more must die or be injured by a gun before Washington acts?"



headline: Trayvon Martin's parents lead protests over Zimmerman verdict
byline: By Edward Upright and Zachary Faginson
8:31am EDT

one week after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murder by a Florida jury in the fatal shooting of the unarmed black teenager.

Across the nation, hundreds marched in the heat of a summer Saturday to rally at federal courthouses in Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities, demanding "Justice for Trayvon."

In Miami, Tracy Martin told about 300 supporters of his son's cause that, after the acquittal, he has "come to realize George Zimmerman wasn't on trial - Trayvon was on trial."

In New York, hip-hop mogul Jay-Z and singer Beyonce, his wife, arrived at one of the largest of the protests organizer Rev. Al Sharpton said were planned for 100 cities nationwide.

Martin's mother stifled sobs as she told the crowd: "Not only I vow to do what I have to do for Trayvon Martin, I promise I'm going to work hard for your children as well."

Among "Boycott Florida" signs were protesters wearing T-shirts with a photo image of Martin in a hooded sweatshirt.

"I've got four beautiful daughters. I want them to look forward rather than behind their backs," said Harlem resident Maria Lopez, 31, who attended the rally with her children.

Visible above the neckline of her Trayvon T-shirt was a tattoo of a packet of Skittles, the candy the teen was carrying when he was shot dead by the neighborhood watchman.

Civil rights leaders had voiced hopes for peaceful protests after outbreaks of violence that earlier this week led to arrests in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area.

Late last Saturday night, a Seminole County jury in central Florida acquitted George Zimmerman, who is part Hispanic, of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the incident, where 17-year-old Martin was shot through the heart.

About 500 people converged on the federal courthouse in Los Angeles under gray skies, toting signs saying â&euro;&tilde;Open Season on the Black Man' and â&euro;&tilde;This Should Not Be OK in 2013 America."

Protesters' chants - "No Justice, No peace" - echoed across the courthouse plaza in call-and-response form.

Another speaker shouted out: "Who was that cryin'?" and the crowd responded: "Trayvon Martin." That exchange was in reference to conflicting testimony about the high-pitched screams for help captured on the 911 call, that were identified by Martin's mother as being Trayvon's, and by Zimmerman's mother as her own son's.

Farther north in foggy downtown San Francisco, about 100 people stood in front of the Federal Building.

Reverend Arnold Townsend, 70, vice president of the local NAACP chapter, vowed to "bring to light this incident let black children know the system has them under attack."

At the White House on Friday, President Barack Obama cautioned against violence, as he urged all Americans to try to understand the Martin case from the perspective of African-Americans.

"There is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws," Obama said. "A lot of African-American boys are painted with a broad brush. If a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario ... both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different."

Zimmerman remained free for more than six weeks after the incident because Sanford, Florida, police accepted that he had acted in self-defense. That ignited protests and cries of injustice across the country, shining a spotlight on issues such as race, profiling and vigilantism.

'A WORLD WHERE RACISM EXISTS'

Sharpton has said he hopes continued public pressure will force the Justice Department to bring a civil rights case against Zimmerman.

Federal prosecutors have said they are investigating whether Zimmerman violated civil rights laws. But lawyers with civil rights expertise have said they think new charges are unlikely.

Public comments from one of the six jurors, citing Florida's Stand Your Ground law as a factor in reaching her conclusion that Zimmerman acted in self-defense, has stepped up pressure on the state's legislature to repeal or change the law.

The jury was told that Zimmerman had "no duty to retreat and right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if he reasonably believed it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself."

Although Stand Your Ground was not cited as part of the defense, the jury's instructions came from the 2005 statute.

Florida Governor Rick Scott told a sit-in outside his office in Tallahassee on Thursday that he supports the law and has no plans to convene a special legislative session to change it.

"We still live in a world where racism exists,'' said Rev. Reginald Edwards at the U.S. District Courthouse in Tallahassee, where nearly 80 protesters assembled at midday to urge federal officials to charge Zimmerman with civil rights violations.



headline: Grandson arrested after elderly men found in squalid Texas home

8:31am EDT

The grandson of the owner of a home where four elderly men were found living in squalor after being reported as potential captives was arrested and charged with elder abuse, police said on Saturday.

Three of the men found at the home in north Houston on Friday were in stable condition on Saturday at Lyndon B. Johnson General Hospital, where they were being treated for malnutrition, police said.

The fourth elderly man was taken to police headquarters for questioning by detectives, said police spokeswoman Jodi Silva.

All four told authorities they had been forced to turn over their government-issued checks, including those for veterans' benefits, police said.

"Any statements made by the victims are being investigated thoroughly," Silva said.

Police arrested Walter Jones, 31, whose grandmother owns the home, and charged him with injury to the elderly by act and injury to the elderly by omission.

Police discovered the men living in filth in a converted garage at the home after receiving a tip on Friday about potential captives being held there.

Three men, aged 80, 74 and one in his 50s, were living in the garage in a room with double locks on the door and a single chair, Houston police spokesman Kees Smith said. There was no toilet and no beds, police said.

No information was released about the age of the fourth man, who also was living in the room.

According to tax records, the 50-year-old home was just over 1,400 square feet (130 square meters). Police believed that nearly 10 people had been living there. The three-bedroom, 1.5-bath home has a converted garage painted bright purple, with bars on the door and windows and a linoleum floor.

"All four are telling the officers at the scene they were enticed to that location with promises of beer and cigarettes and not allowed to leave, and then forced to turn over checks such as veterans' checks," Smith said.

Police said the men provided conflicting accounts about how long they have been at the house. Some initially reported being there as long as 10 years but were changing their stories.

The discovery comes two months after three women were freed from a decade of imprisonment in a Cleveland, Ohio house where police say they were repeatedly raped and brutalized by their captor. In that case, a former school bus driver, Ariel Castro, has pleaded not guilty to 977 kidnap, rape and other charges.

In addition to the men, three females with disabilities, whose ages have not been released, were also found living in the main part of the house, but were not being held against their will, police said.

headline: Ex-CIA official detained in Panama returns to U.S.
byline: By Lesley Wroughton
8:31am EDT

Former CIA Milan station chief Robert Seldon Lady, who was convicted in Italy of kidnapping an Egyptian Muslim cleric and detained in Panama this week, returned to the United States on Friday, a State Department spokeswoman said.

The ex-spy was among 23 Americans sentenced in absentia by an Italian judge in 2009 for the abduction of the cleric. It was unclear whether any action would be taken against Lady, who was sentenced by Italy to a nine-year jail term, after his return to the United States.

Lady was originally sentenced in the first trial of its kind against "rendition" flights practiced by the administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush.

Italy's top court last year upheld the guilty verdict against Lady for the kidnapping of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, who was snatched from a Milan street in 2003 and flown to Egypt for interrogation where he says he was tortured.

The rendition flights by the Bush administration have been condemned by human rights groups and prompted investigations into the procedure in countries allied to the United States.

Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said she had no details on whether Lady would be questioned by U.S. authorities, or whether the United States would cooperate with Italy on the case.

A Panamanian foreign ministry source said Lady was detained for 24 hours at the border with Costa Rica pending an extradition request from Italy.

He was let go because Panama does not have an extradition treaty with Italy and because documentation sent by Italian officials was "insufficient," the source said.

Italy expressed disappointment at Panama's actions, saying it had taken all the diplomatic steps seeking his temporary detention so that the extradition procedure could be started.

"I am astonished to observe that our request was disregarded without plausible explanation," Italian Justice Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri said in a statement.

In April, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano pardoned U.S. Air Force Colonel Joseph Romano, who had been among the Americans sentenced for the kidnapping.

ESCAPED FROM ITALY

Lady was quoted by Il Giornale newspaper in 2009 as saying: "I'm not guilty. I'm only responsible for carrying out orders that I received from my superiors."

Also in that interview, he lamented that he had wanted to stay in Italy but his retirement villa with vineyards had been seized to cover court costs.

"I love Italy. I had decided to live my life in Italy," the retired spy told the newspaper. "Instead I had to escape."

It was not clear why Lady was in Central America and risked arrest by crossing borders.

He was bounced around between two Central American countries as he attempted to leave Panama for Costa Rica at around 9:30 a.m. local time on Thursday, Costa Rican immigration department spokeswoman Andrea Quezada said.

He arrived alone at a Costa Rican border checkpoint near the southwestern town of Paso Canoas but was sent back to Panama when a red alert, indicating an Interpol arrest warrant, appeared in the checkpoint's database, she said.

Costa Rica does not treat red alerts as grounds for immediate arrest whereas Panama does, an Interpol official in Costa Rica said. As a result, Lady was denied entry to Costa Rica.

Due to confusion over the spelling of the ex-CIA official's name, Panamanian officials did not initially detect him in their database and only discovered their error after Interpol discussions between the two countries, the official added.

After that he was detained in Panama, and then released.

The New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights said the United States should not block Lady's extradition to Italy just as it was seeking the return of former spy agency contractor Edward Snowden, who is charged with leaking information about secret U.S. surveillance programs.

Snowden has been charged under the U.S. Espionage Act and has been stuck at a Moscow airport as he seeks asylum abroad.



headline: Biden calls Brazil's Rousseff over NSA spying tensions
headline: Pressure grows on San Diego mayor over harassment accusations
byline: By Alex Dobuzinskis
8:31am EDT

San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, who has resisted calls to resign over allegations he groped and made suggestive comments toward women, came under increasing pressure this week as fellow Democrats urged him to quit and as talk emerged of a recall campaign.

Filner drew fire as leader of California's second-largest city last week after a former city councilwoman and two lawyers held a news conference to say at least one woman has accused the mayor of improper behavior.

A 70-year-old Democrat in a city that historically leans conservative, Filner later admitted to behaving inappropriately toward female staff members but indicated he would not step aside, saying he wanted to prove he was "capable of change."

In recent days, prominent local Democrats have publicly urged him to quit. A Republican foe, describing Filner as "ineffective," said on Friday he would attempt a recall but that the sexual harassment allegations would not be the main focus.

"I don't want to detract from what we're doing, all we're trying to do is clean house and this is one of many charges leveled against him," said Michael Pallamary, 59, who in 1991 led a successful recall effort against a San Diego city councilwoman.

Filner had become a polarizing figure in San Diego before the current controversy. He has clashed with the city attorney over policies for medical marijuana and with the hotel industry over the city's share of tourism advertising.

To force a recall election, Pallamary's group will need to collect 101,000 signatures in 39 days after publishing a notice of its intent to recall Filner, a clock that has not yet started.

The calls for Filner's resignation began last week when former San Diego Democratic city councilwoman Donna Frye and two attorneys announced that at least one woman, whom they did not name, had provided them details of his alleged inappropriate behavior.

UNWELCOME ADVANCES ALLEGED

On Monday, the trio announced more graphic details. Frye said Filner made unwelcome advances against two constituents and "jammed his tongue down" the throat of one of them. Lawyer Marco Gonzalez said a client who worked for Filner said he groped her and suggested she not wear panties.

Among local Democrats who publicly called this week for Filner to resign are U.S. Representatives Susan Davis and Scott Peters. Others including San Diego City Council president Todd Gloria have also asked for him to step aside.

"He says he'll be dragged out kicking and screaming, but I think I've been in the minority in terms of pundits in saying that a resignation will come relatively soon," said political analyst John Dadian, who has worked with local Republican officials.

So far, no women have stepped forward to publicly accuse Filner. A Filner representative did not respond to calls or emails seeking an interview.

"I do not believe I am guilty of sexual harassment, and I believe a full presentation of the facts will vindicate me," he said in a statement on Monday. The same day, the mayor told television station KUSI, "I'm a hugger, with both men and women."

With no one going public to say he or she was personally harassed by Filner, some have questioned the allegations. On Thursday, about 50 people including many activists from poor neighborhoods rallied in his support outside a city administration building.

"If he is guilty, I'll be out here to stand with the women because I am a woman," said rally participant Kathleen Harmon, 83. "But I don't know that the allegations are true ... The mayor deserves due process."

University of California, San Diego, political science professor Steven Erie said Filner might not be so easily ousted and was a tough politician, citing time he spent in a Mississippi jail in the 1960s as a civil rights activist.

"I don't think he's going to resign, and the only thing that's going to force him from office is a felony conviction or a recall before his term ends," Erie said.



headline: Retirees could bear brunt of Detroit bankruptcy

When Paula Kaczmarek moved to Detroit in 1978 to work for the city's public library system, a guarantee of good retirement benefits was a key sweetener that convinced her to leave her previous job in Boston.

"I basically came here for future security," said Kaczmarek, who retired in 2012, two years earlier than she planned, as the public library was facing potential layoffs.

Kaczmarek is among the more than 20,000 unionized retirees whose pensions and healthcare benefits hang in the balance after Detroit filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.

In an interview, Kevyn Orr, Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, said restructuring the city's crippling legacy costs is critical to Detroit's recovery.

"We can't pay benefits with money that's not there," he said. "It can't be done."

Retirees and labor officials acknowledged that the city's finances were in shambles and they would have to share in the sacrifice to help Detroit recover. But they said some of the significant benefits cuts reportedly proposed by Orr in talks with creditors would have a devastating impact on their lives.

"I do have some compassion for people who are investors in Detroit, naturally, because a lot of my pension income is based on investing," said 63-year-old retired city librarian Ellen Simmons. "But it's hard to have a lot of sympathy when there are 20,000 real people who are not living high on the hog."

Although city retirement benefits are enshrined in Michigan's constitution, there is no clear road map for what will happen in a Chapter 9 bankruptcy, experts said. The question is made more complicated by the fact that it is unclear who has the legal authority to negotiate on behalf of the retirees.

Orr and labor officials have locked horns over how to manage pension and retiree healthcare obligations. Orr was appointed by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder in March to try to resolve the city's financial crisis and tackle its $18.5 billion in long-term debt.

The city lists about $644 million in unfunded pension liabilities, but Orr has said the number is closer to $3.5 billion if "more realistic assumptions" are taken into account. Other unfunded post-employment liabilities, which include retiree healthcare costs, account for $5.7 billion of the city's outstanding debts.

The city of Detroit's two largest unsecured creditors are the city's general retirement fund and the police and fire departments' retirement fund.

In a court filing, Orr said the city intended to create a committee of retired employees to represent those workers.

"The appointment of a retiree committee is adequate representation for these individuals and to facilitate the city's restructuring of its pension and other post-employment benefit liabilities," Orr said in his filing.

Orr faced three separate lawsuits from current and retired workers trying to bar his attempts to file Chapter 9.

The conflict ratcheted up when Detroit filed for bankruptcy in federal court Thursday just minutes before labor lawyers could block those efforts in another state court located 90 miles away.

At this point, it's unclear how much of a haircut, if any, the retirees will be forced to take. Still, they're preparing for the worst.

Simmons, who retired in January after working for the public library for more than 30 years, said she might have to go back to work or even move in with one of her children depending on how much is cut from her pension.

"My married kids, do they want mom living with them? They'll be gracious about it, but that's not what any of us want," she said.

long heat wave.

The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) forecast consumer demand use peaked at 33,955 megawatts on Friday, up from 33,450 MW on Thursday, breaking the state's all-time record of 33,939 MW set in 2006.

One megawatt powers about 1,000 homes.

NYISO said it was possible that demand could continue to rise and the record peak load could change later on Friday.

"Due to the superb teamwork and coordination of New York's transmission owning utilities, electric generating companies, demand response resources, energy services providers and government agencies, we have successfully met record-high electric demand with sustained reliable operation of the bulk electric system," NYISO Chief Executive Stephen Whitley said in statement.

Earlier on Friday, Consolidated Edison Inc, the state's biggest utility, said power demand in its New York City and Westchester service area had reached an all time high of 13,214 MW at 2 p.m. ET, breaking the old record of 13,189 MW set on July 22, 2011.

Temperatures in New York City, the biggest metropolitan area in the United States, are expected to reach 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37 C) on Friday and 94 F on Saturday, according to weather forecaster AccuWeather.com. Thunderstorms on Saturday are expected to break the heat wave.

So far this week, the mercury reached 90 F on Sunday, 94 F on Monday and Tuesday, 97 F on Wednesday and 98 F on Thursday. The normal high for this time of year is 84 F. Regional power grid operators and utilities have not had to take any major steps to keep the lights on and air conditioners humming.

They have asked consumers to conserve power, defer non-essential equipment maintenance and activate demand response programs to reduce energy usage, but there have been no widespread blackouts, just some scattered outages.

NYISO said its demand response programs could reduce power usage by more than 1,250 MW.

ISO New England, which operates the power grid for the six New England states, said it activated its demand response program on Friday, which could reduce usage by about 400 MW as power supplies become tight with demand near record levels.

Demand response program participants are compensated for reducing electricity use, and could be penalized for not doing so, by raising air conditioner thermostats and turning off unnecessary lights and other equipment, including elevators, and operating on-site generators to reduce the amount of power needed from the grid.

The biggest power companies in New York include units of Con Edison, National Grid Plc, Iberdrola SA, Entergy Corp, TransCanada Corp and NRG Energy Inc.

The biggest power companies in New England include units of National Grid, Northeast Utilities, Iberdrola, NextEra Energy Inc, Dominion Resources Inc, Entergy and Exelon Corp.



headline: U.S. court says reporter must testify in leak case

profile government leak case, saying journalists do not have special free speech protections.

The ruling by the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is a victory for the Obama administration, but it could hurt efforts by Attorney General Eric Holder to improve relations with the media. The Justice Department last week pledged to tighten its criteria for targeting journalists in leak cases.

Two other cases this year sparked a media outcry that the Justice Department had been overzealous in investigating government leaks and had infringed on free speech rights.

Prosecutors sought the testimony of reporter James Risen, author of a book, "State of War," that contained information the government believed was leaked by former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling.

In 2010, Sterling was indicted on 10 charges relating to Risen's book, including unauthorized retention and communication of national defense information.

The following year, Holder authorized the Justice Department to issue a subpoena seeking Risen's testimony. Risen challenged the subpoena, saying he could not be compelled to testify under the First Amendment and federal common law.

A three-judge panel ruled Friday there is no "reporter's privilege" under the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, meaning journalists do not receive special treatment.

"The reporter must appear and give testimony just as every other citizen must," wrote Chief Judge William Traxler. "We are not at liberty to conclude otherwise."

Judge Roger Gregory dissented, pointing out that the law is not clear on the issue. Some courts have found in the past that there are instances in which reporters can invoke a "qualified privilege," which means they can refuse to testify.

"The paramount importance of the free press guaranteed by our Constitution compels me to conclude that the First Amendment encompasses a qualified reporter's privilege," Gregory wrote.

Risen's attorney, Joel Kurtzberg, said he was disappointed with the ruling and that he and his client were "evaluating our next steps." A spokesman said the Justice Department agreed with the decision and was considering how to proceed.

David Anderson, an expert in media law at the University of Texas at Austin, said the ruling was consistent with recent rulings in similar cases, which have indicated "a hardening of the judicial arteries toward the press."

If Risen refuses to testify, he will almost certainly face imprisonment and "had better pack his toothbrush," he said.

Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer in Los Angeles who has represented journalists in similar cases, said the ruling should prompt the Justice Department to back down on its request that Risen testify.

"One would hope they would look at this situation anew," he said.

MEDIA OUTCRY

court brief in support of Risen.

Congress is considering a new media shield law, backed by President Barack Obama, that would enshrine legal protections for journalists. The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on the bill next week.

Friday's ruling came one week after the Justice Department issued new guidelines that would curb the ability of prosecutors to seize reporters' records when investigating leaks.

In a recent case, prosecutors obtained a warrant to search Fox News correspondent James Rosen's emails. He was named a "co-conspirator" in a federal leaks probe involving his reporting on North Korea.

In another case, the Justice Department seized Associated Press phone records as part of a probe into leaks about a 2012 Yemen-based plot to bomb a U.S. airliner.

year veteran of bankruptcy courts with experience handling municipal restructurings to preside over Detroit's historic bankruptcy.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes is the most experienced bankruptcy judge in Detroit and has a reputation for being tough but fair. He presided over the only previous Chapter 9 filing in the Eastern District of Michigan, according to letters from other judges that were included in the filing.

Rhodes "is very knowledgeable about the relationship of federal bankruptcy law to state constitutional and other state law, which will likely be an important issue in this case," Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Phillip Shefferly wrote in letter dated July 19.

The city of Detroit's Chapter 9 filing on Thursday marked the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. It comes after decades of neglect that led to the appointment of Kevyn Orr as the city's emergency manager in March.

The sooner-than-expected move triggered outrage from labor officials who were in state court at the time trying to block Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and Orr from filing for bankruptcy. On Friday, the state court judge in Michigan's capital of Lansing ordered Orr to withdraw the bankruptcy petition.

Rhodes was given the case by Alice Batchelder, chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which is in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Rhodes was slated to retire at the end of the year and was already winding down his case load. But he indicated that he "has the time and is willing to preside over this case for its duration," Shefferly said.

"It makes perfect sense for him to have this because he can devote the time to the case and the attention," said Douglas Bernstein, a managing partner of Plunkett Cooney's bankruptcy practice in suburban Detroit. "And the good thing is, he won't be intimidated by the big case."



headline: Obama says 'Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago'
byline: By Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton
8:31am EDT

President Barack Obama on Friday jumped into the debate over the acquittal of the man who killed black Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, declaring that Martin "could have been me, 35 years ago" and urging Americans to understand the pain blacks felt over the case.

Obama abruptly appeared in the White House press briefing room to offer his thoughts on the trial of George Zimmerman, the Sanford, Florida, neighborhood watch volunteer who was found not guilty of murder for shooting Martin, 17, in a struggle in 2012.

The televised trial and Saturday's verdict highlighted contentious issues such as racial profiling, with many blacks arguing that Zimmerman chose to follow Martin because he was black, and rejecting Zimmerman's self-defense argument.

Without saying so specifically, Obama sided with those who say the shooting need not have happened, expressing sympathy to the Martin family and praising them for the "incredible grace and dignity with which they've dealt with the entire situation."

He said the case was properly handled in the Florida court and acknowledged the relevance of the jury finding reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case. He questioned "stand your ground" self-defense laws that have been adopted in 30 states.

Obama, however, said Americans should understand the perspective of the black community, which has suffered a long history of racial discrimination.

"You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago," he said somberly.

Obama, 51, born in Hawaii to a black Kenyan father and white American mother, recalled his own encounters with racism and racial profiling.

"There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me," he said.

He said he sometimes heard the clicks of car doors locking when he walked across the street in his younger days.

"There are very few African-Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often," he said.

Citing the experiences of his teenage daughters, Obama said younger generations have fewer issues with racism. Still, he said, Americans need to do some "soul searching" on whether they harbor prejudice and should judge people not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character.

"Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race. It doesn't mean we're in a post-racial society. It doesn't mean that racism is eliminated ... We're becoming a more perfect union, not a perfect union, but a more perfect union," he said.

19 surveyed 616 Americans and had a "credibility interval" of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

After issuing a written statement on Sunday, Obama kept silent publicly on the case as some reacted angrily to the verdict. An aide said Obama had watched the coverage of the case on television and had talked to friends and family about it.

He informed some senior staff on Thursday that he wanted to address the issue publicly. An appearance at the start of White House press secretary Jay Carney's daily briefing was deemed the best venue.

PRAISE FOR OBAMA

Trayvon's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, issued a statement on Friday praising Obama and saying they were aware that their son's death and the jury's verdict had been deeply painful and difficult for many people.

"What touches people is that our son, Trayvon Benjamin Martin, could have been their son. President Obama sees himself in Trayvon and identifies with him. This is a beautiful tribute to our boy," they said.

Leaders of the black community also praised Obama.

"That our president has been profiled should encourage all Americans to think deeply about both the depth of this problem and how our country moves beyond it," said Benjamin Jealous, the president and chief executive officer of the NAACP, the nation's oldest civil rights group.

Noting racial disparities in the application of criminal law ranging from the death penalty to drug enforcement, Obama urged the Justice Department to work with local governments to reduce mistrust in the justice system and said states should ensure their laws did not provoke incidents like the Martin killing.

Obama specifically mentioned Florida's "stand-your-ground" law, which allows individuals to use reasonable force to defend themselves without any obligation to retreat or flee. Critics of the Sanford police department's investigation of Zimmerman say it was central to the decision not to arrest him immediately.

The law did not factor in Zimmerman's trial, though a juror cited it in acquitting him.

"I just ask people to consider, if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened? And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws," said Obama.



headline: Competing rallies in Colorado ahead of theater shooting anniversary
byline: By Keith Coffman
8:31am EDT

Gun control activists staged a vigil in a Colorado park on Friday to remember those killed a year ago in a shooting rampage in a suburban Denver theater, as a gun rights group rallied nearby to protest what they called the exploitation of the tragedy for political gain.

The competing demonstrations on either side of the gun control debate took place about a quarter-mile apart in the suburb of Aurora's sprawling, picturesque Cherry Creek State Park, but there was little interaction between them.

At the anniversary vigil, organized by a gun control group co-founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, activists and community leaders called on Washington lawmakers to pass legislation aimed at reducing gun violence as supporters held placards reading "No more names."

At one point, a handful of gun rights supporters stood outside the vigil of around 50 people, quietly holding signs in protest. At least a dozen uniformed Colorado State Patrol officers kept watch.

"You have Mayor Bloomberg politicizing this event and this is our answer to that," said Danielle Thompson, spokeswoman for Rocky Mountain Gun Owners. "We believe in putting the tools of self-defense in the hands of law-abiding citizens while Bloomberg's solution is to restrict and ban guns."

Other pro-gun activists wore orange hunting caps with the National Rifle Association logo or carried signs that read: "Aurora was a tragedy, Bloomberg is a travesty," and "Mayor Bloomberg mind your own business, not Colorado's."

Twelve people were killed and 58 others wounded on July 20, 2012 when a gunman opened fire during a midnight screening of the Batman film "The Dark Knight Rises" at a movie theater in Aurora. A dozen others suffered non-gunshot injuries in the ensuing pandemonium.

Former University of Colorado graduate student James Holmes, 25, has been charged with multiple counts of first degree murder and attempted murder. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if he is convicted.

State Representative Rhonda Fields, who spoke at the memorial vigil organized by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, called the counter-rally by gun rights advocates "insensitive and rude."

"They are re-traumatizing the victims as they try to remember their loved ones," she said.

The memorial was attended by family members of people killed in the theater rampage and of shooting victims of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, last December. Among them was Tom Sullivan, whose son Alex was killed in the theater on his birthday.

"I now measure my time by Fridays," Sullivan said, referring to the day of the shooting. "It has now been 52 Fridays since Alex was taken from us by gun violence."

Sullivan praised Colorado lawmakers for passing new gun legislation following the shootings in Aurora and Newtown. The laws ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds and require background checks for private gun sales and transfers.

Participants later planned to read names of thousands of gun violence victims from across the country, ending at 12:38 a.m. on Saturday morning, the moment gunfire erupted in the theater.



headline: U.S. court renews surveillance program exposed by Snowden
byline: By Deborah Charles
8:31am EDT

one of the two data collection efforts leaked by former security contractor Edward Snowden.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, said its authority to maintain the program expired on Friday and that the government sought and received a renewal from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court.

The ODNI said in a statement it was disclosing the renewal as part of an effort at greater transparency following Snowden's disclosure of the telephone data collection and email surveillance programs.

A top official said earlier on Friday that intelligence officials were working to declassify information on the programs that Snowden had already partially disclosed.

Robert Litt, general counsel of ODNI, said he was optimistic the intelligence community could make "a lot of progress" in declassifying the information.

U.S. officials faced a public uproar after Snowden began leaking classified information about telephone and email collection programs. Intelligence officials have been pushing to justify the programs as legal, particularly under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which requires a secret court to approve the programs.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court sided on Monday with Yahoo Inc and ordered the Obama administration to declassify and publish a 2008 court decision justifying Prism, the data collection program revealed last month by Snowden.

The ruling could offer a rare glimpse into how the government has legally justified its spy agencies' data collection programs under FISA.

"One of the hurdles to declassification earlier was that the existence of the programs was classified," Litt said in response to questions after a speech at the Brookings Institution. "It's very hard to think about releasing the opinion that says a particular program is legal if you're not going to disclose what the program is. Now that the program has been declassified, we're going back and we're looking at these opinions."

Litt said intelligence officials were looking across the spectrum of its activities to see what could be declassified.

"We're trying to prioritize things that we think are of the greatest public interest," he said. "The highest priority is getting out fuller information about the programs about which partial information is already out."

The 2008 ruling mentioned by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court stemmed from Yahoo's challenge of the legality of broad, warrantless surveillance programs like Prism.

A number of major U.S. Internet companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook, have asked the government for permission to disclose the number of national security-related user data requests they receive.

Snowden, who faces espionage charges for releasing the classified information, has been holed up at a Moscow airport for three weeks trying to avoid prosecution. This week, he sought temporary asylum in Russia.



headline: N.Y. woman accused of false claim on Boston Marathon victim fund
byline: By Francesca Trianni
8:31am EDT

A New York woman was charged on Friday with attempted larceny for collecting a fraudulent $480,000 claim from a charity set up to benefit victims of the April Boston Marathon bombing, prosecutors said.

The Massachusetts Attorney General's office said Audrea Gause, 26, of Troy, 155 miles north of New York City, claimed she had suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of the April 15 bombing and filed a fraudulent request to the One Fund Boston, a charity that has raised more than $64 million for victims. Three people were killed and 264 were injured in the blasts.

According to the charges, Gause said she experienced long-term memory loss, impaired speech and loss of some motor function. When authorities received information that Gause may have not been in Boston during the marathon bombing, they opened an investigation.

"By doing this, she was stealing money from the real victims of the marathon bombing, and from the people who gave so generously to help them," Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley said in a statement.

Gause could not be reached for comment and it was unclear on Friday if she had retained an attorney.

She is the second person charged with defrauding the fund. Earlier in July, a Boston man was charged with larceny for allegedly submitting a $2 million dollar fraudulent claim on behalf of his aunt, who had been dead for more than a decade.

The fund is being managed by Kenneth Feinberg, an arbitration attorney who also oversaw compensation for victims of the 9/11 attacks and the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado.

About 250 people have applied for money from the One Fund charity, set up to benefit the families of those killed in the blasts and those who lost limbs.



headline: Thunderstorms could hamper efforts to subdue California wildfire
byline: By Steve Gorman
8:31am EDT

Firefighters raced on Friday to buttress defensive lines against a fierce blaze roaring for a fifth day near the scenic mountain resort of Idyllwild in Southern California, as thunderstorms in the forecast threatened to hamper efforts to subdue the flames.

The so-called Mountain Fire has already burned across more than 24,800 acres of dry brush and timber and forced the evacuation of Idyllwild after destroying seven nearby homes and other property in the rugged San Jacinto range, authorities said.

The blaze, which ranks as federal fire managers' top priority among 17 large wildfires across several western states, erupted on Monday afternoon in the San Bernardino National Forest, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles.

The San Jacinto range overlooks Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage and several smaller desert towns to the northeast, but the main threat has been to the village of Idyllwild, a popular vacation destination in the mountains.

The mile-high community, known for its hiking trails, rock climbing and arts and music scene, was ordered evacuated on Wednesday, along with the neighboring town of Fern Valley and surrounding parks and campgrounds as flames advanced.

Combined with smaller communities ordered to vacate earlier in the week, authorities estimated that some 6,000 residents, campers and other seasonal visitors had been chased out by the fire. Some 2,200 homes remained under evacuation on Friday.

Citing the potential for "extreme fire growth" on Friday afternoon, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department issued an evacuation warning to residents of Pine Cove, adjacent to Idyllwild, urging them to be ready to flee at a moment's notice.

The famed Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, a rotating gondola that carries visitors from the desert floor to an observation post near the San Jacinto peak, also has been closed down because of heavy smoke.

PALM SPRINGS SAFE FOR NOW

But Rico Smith, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, said the fire's northern edge was still about six miles from the center of Palm Springs, a city of 46,000 known for trendy shopping and restaurants that was once a playground for Hollywood stars like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby.

With wide stretches of sparse, desert vegetation separating the mountain foothills from Palm Springs and nearby communities, those towns were not in imminent danger, Smith said.

On the mountain, fire crews continued to reinforce a defensive buffer zone along a high ridge line between the western flank of the blaze and Idyllwild. One favorable factor for much of the week has been relatively calm winds.

But Smith said gusts of up to 40 miles per hour were forecast for Friday afternoon with thunderstorms expected to move into the area. Strong, erratic winds would complicate efforts to keep flames at bay, he said. Lightning strikes could also spark new fires, but any rains would help douse the blaze.

The fire has now grown large enough to create its own potentially hazardous weather. Towering columns of smoke and ash spewed from the blaze can breed storm activity by themselves, fire officials said.

If those columns rise high enough, they can form ice clouds that could eventually force the smoke plumes to collapse, unleashing down drafts that can push the fire in numerous directions.

By Friday morning, the blaze was 15 percent contained. No injuries have been reported, but seven residences were destroyed on Tuesday along with five commercial structures, more than a dozen outbuildings and several vehicles. The cause of the fire remained under investigation.

Experts say this year could see one of the worst U.S. fire seasons ever. In recent weeks, a Colorado wildfire ranked as that state's most destructive on record ravaged more than 500 homes and killed two people. In Arizona, 19 members of an elite "hotshot" crew died while battling a separate fire on June 30.



headline: Elderly men found in Houston squalor, may have been held captive
byline: By Amanda Orr
8:31am EDT

At least three elderly men were found living in squalor in a converted garage in Houston on Friday and police were investigating whether they had been held against their will and forced to hand over veterans' benefit checks.

Houston police spokesman Kese Smith said three men, aged 80, 74 and one in his 50s, were living in a room described as dirty, with double locks on the door and a single chair. There was neither a toilet nor any beds, police said.

A fourth man, age 65, was also living at the home, Smith said.

According to tax records, the 50-year-old home was a tight fit at just over 1,400 square feet for nearly 10 people police believe may have lived there. The three-bedroom, 1.5-bath home in an older north Houston neighborhood has a converted garage painted bright purple, with bars on the door and windows and a linoleum floor.

A man has been detained for questioning and is considered a suspect, but no charges have been filed, police said.

A second Houston police official, spokeswoman Jodi Silva, said the men appeared to be malnourished. Three were taken to a hospital, while the fourth was talking to detectives at police headquarters.

"All four are telling the officers at the scene they were enticed to that location with promises of beer and cigarettes and not allowed to leave, and then forced to turn over checks such as veterans checks," Smith said.

Police said the men provided conflicting accounts about how long they have been at the house. Some initially reported being there as long as 10 years but were changing their stories.

The discovery comes two months after three women were freed from a decade of imprisonment in a Cleveland, Ohio house where police say they were repeatedly raped and brutalized by their captor. In that case, a former school bus driver, Ariel Castro, has pleaded not guilty to 977 kidnap, rape and other charges.

In Friday's discovery in Houston, police officers arrived at the home at about 8:30 a.m. after receiving a call requesting they check on the welfare of its inhabitants, Smith said. In addition to the men, three females with disabilities, whose ages have not been released, were also found living in the house, but were not being held against their will.

headline: 'Whitey' Bulger sidekick recalls murder of girlfriend
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

James "Whitey" Bulger's longtime partner in crime recalled on Friday how the mob boss killed the sidekick's girlfriend in 1981, strangling her after learning she knew about Bulger's dealings with a corrupt FBI agent.

Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi testified that Bulger persuaded him that Debra Davis had to die so she would never tell anyone about their arrangement with FBI agent John Connolly. Flemmi said he brought Davis to a house in South Boston that their gang used for executions.

"We walked in, and as soon as we walked in, in a matter of seconds, she walked in the entrance and he grabbed her by the neck," Flemmi testified.

He said Bulger knew Flemmi couldn't carry out the murder, telling his associate, "I'll take care of it, I'll do it."

Flemmi, who is serving a life sentence for 10 murders, is the prosecution's star witness in Bulger's trial on charges of racketeering, extortion and drug dealing. Authorities contend the mob boss committed or ordered 19 murders in the 1970s and 80s when he ran the Winter Hill gang.

Bulger disapproved of Flemmi's relationship with Davis, a woman more than two decades younger, he testified. Bulger frowned on the lavish presents Flemmi bought her, including a Mercedes and fancy jewelry.

He said Bulger was also annoyed when Davis complained that Flemmi often had to go out at night on gang business.

"It was having an impact," Flemmi told the jury. "She required a lot of attention. She was a young girl."

The last straw for Bulger came when Flemmi tried to explain his nighttime absences by telling Davis that he and Bulger routinely met with FBI agent Connolly, who grew up in their neighborhood. The three met hundreds of times over about 15 years, with Connolly turning a blind eye to crimes committed by Bulger's Irish mob in exchange for information he could use against the Italian Mafia, prosecutors contend.

After Bulger killed Davis, Flemmi said, other gang members came around in a car and loaded her body into it. After dark, they buried her, with Flemmi digging the hole while his boss looked on.

Davis was one of two women close to Flemmi who wound up dead at the gang's hands, prosecutors charge. Four years after killing Davis, the gang murdered Flemmi's step-daughter, Deborah Hussey, also because they feared she would talk.

Bulger, 83, faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty, though his attorney admitted that his client had been a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark, in others words an "organized criminal."

After a 1994 tip from Connolly, Bulger fled Boston before the FBI could arrest him. After 16 years on the lam, he was captured in 2011 in California. His story inspired the 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed," where Jack Nicholson played a character loosely based on Bulger.

COMMON BOND

Flemmi said that he and Bulger began their 20-year partnership in 1974, when Flemmi returned from three years hiding in Montreal after a gang war spiraled "out of control."

He admired Bulger for having a strict health regimen that stood out among gangsters.

"He didn't drink, he didn't smoke, he worked out regularly," Flemmi said of Bulger. "We both had that in common."

Flemmi said both he and Bulger served as FBI informants, but Bulger has repeatedly denied this through his attorney.

Flemmi said Bulger paid Connolly for tips and also gave the agent lavish gifts, including a diamond ring and a belt buckle from the Alcatraz prison island where Bulger had done time early in his criminal career. Bulger contends he paid the agent for tips but offered no information of his own.

Connolly, now serving a 40-year prison sentence on racketeering and murder convictions, spent lavishly, dressing better than any other agent in the Boston office of the FBI and at one point buying a boat.

"When Jim Bulger found out about that, he was upset," Flemmi said.

Bulger thought Connolly risked attracting attention but he was convinced he could play the relationship with the FBI to his advantage, Flemmi told the court.

Flemmi quoted his old boss as saying: "If they want to play checkers, we can play chess."



headline: Canada investigators want rule changes after deadly rail crash
byline: By Julie Gordon
8:31am EDT

Canadian investigators issued their first recommendations on Friday after a devastating train wreck in Quebec, urging that trains hauling dangerous goods not be left unattended, and pushing for stricter guidelines on railway braking systems.

Transportation Safety Board (TSB) investigators probing the July 6 disaster in the lakeside town of Lac-Megantic said the "braking force" applied to the train, which was hauling 72 tanker cars of crude oil, was insufficient to hold it in place.

The train was operated by Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway (MMA), which is controlled by Rail World Inc, a privately held rail management and investment firm based outside Chicago.

The train had been parked for the night on a main line uphill from the town. Unmanned, it rolled down the track, and derailed and exploded in the center of Lac-Megantic.

An estimated 50 people were killed in North America's worst train accident in more than 20 years, and the town center was destroyed.

TSB investigator Ed Belkaloul did not say how many hand brakes had been set when the train was parked. But he noted there was "enormous variability" in the strength of the brakes, which are located on individual rail cars and operated by manually turning a large wheel that sets the brake shoes beneath the train.

"If you look on your car, if your brake shoes are finished, even if you set them, it won't give you anything," he said. "Same here. The number of brakes is important, but the quality of the braking is also important."

General braking instructions for railways, dating from 1997, state that operators must use "sufficient brakes," and test them by attempting to pull the train back and forth - typically using the engine - to ensure the brakes will hold in place.

"What's missing now ... are specific instructions for a particular place," Belkaloul added. Variables include the number of cars, the grade on which the train is parked and other factors such as local conditions and wind.

Transport Minister Lisa Raitt has asked Transport Canada, the government department that regulates railways, to review the TSB recommendations "on an expedited basis," a spokeswoman said.

STRICTER STANDARDS

Since the accident, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, whose guidelines MMA said it was following, has made some two dozen changes to the hand brake section of its General Operating Instructions, according to documents obtained by Reuters.

CP removed a chart that gave minimum hand brake requirements for trains based on the number of cars. That chart had said a minimum of nine hand brakes were needed on a train with 72 cars.

The new rules say hand brakes must now be applied on at least 25 percent of the cars for trains parked on a slope of 1.2 percent, the grade of the tracks outside of Lac-Megantic, unless the brakes have been properly tested.

Canadian National Railway Co, the country's biggest railroad, is also reviewing its policy for securing trains and expects to implement new standards shortly.

The TSB is also analyzing the contents of the tanker cars that did not explode in the crash, looking for clues as to why the crude oil in the other cars exploded so violently.

The train was carrying oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to a refinery on Canada's East Coast, part of a huge growth in shipments of crude by rail as North American oil production rises and pipelines fill to capacity.

Nearly two weeks after the disaster, investigators continue to sift through what police describe as a crime scene, searching for more bodies and for clues on the cause of the accident.



headline: Toyota gets final OK for settlement of U.S. acceleration class action
byline: By Jessica Dye
8:31am EDT

A U.S. judge on Friday gave final approval to the settlement of a class action lawsuit against Toyota Motor Corp by plaintiffs who claimed design defects caused some of the company's vehicles to accelerate without warning.

U.S. District Judge James Selna in California gave final approval during a court hearing on Friday, lawyers for the plaintiffs said. The settlement was initially approved in December.

The terms include direct payments to customers as well as free installation of brake-override systems in an estimated 3.25 million eligible vehicles, and the establishment of a customer support program, according to court filings.

Plaintiffs' lawyers valued the deal at more than $1.6 billion, calling it "a landmark, if not a record, settlement in automobile defect class action litigation in the United States," according to court filings. The lawsuit was filed in 2010.

Toyota, which has the third largest share of the U.S. auto market, announced in December that it would take a one-time pre-tax charge of $1.1 billion to cover the estimated settlement costs. It has denied any wrongdoing.

"This agreement allows us to resolve a legacy legal issue in a way that provides significant value to our customers and demonstrates that they can depend on Toyota to stand behind our vehicles," Toyota spokeswoman Celeste Migliore said in a statement following the hearing Friday.

Concerns about potential unintended acceleration issues caused Toyota to recall more than 10 million vehicles between 2009 and 2011. Plaintiffs said in the lawsuit that media reports and consumer complaints about the alleged defects caused the trade-in value for their vehicles to plummet.

The settlement of the lawsuit covers economic losses stemming from the alleged safety defects, but does not include claims of wrongful death, personal injury or property damage.

More than 22 million potential class members have been notified of the settlement, according to court filings. Owners of affected Toyota, Lexus and Scion models sold in the United States have until July 29 to decide whether to participate in the settlement and file claims, according to court filings.

Plaintiffs' lawyers are seeking $200 million in fees and $27 million for their expenses, the filings said.

long heat wave.

The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) forecast consumer power use would peak at 34,600 MW on Friday, up from 33,450 MW on Thursday, which would break the state's all-time record of 33,939 MW set in 2006 before industrial and commercial businesses cut back on power usage during the recession. One megawatt powers about 1,000 homes.

Consolidated Edison Inc, the state's biggest utility, said power demand in its New York City and Westchester service area reached an all time high of 13,214 MW at 2 p.m. Eastern time, breaking the old record of 13,189 MW set on July 22, 2011.

Temperatures in New York City, the biggest metropolitan area in the United States, are expected to reach 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37 C) Friday and 94 F on Saturday before thunderstorms later Saturday break the heat wave, according to weather forecaster AccuWeather.com.

So far this week, the mercury has reached 90 F on Sunday, 94 F on Monday and Tuesday, 97 F on Wednesday and 98 F on Thursday. The normal high for this time of year is 84 F degrees.

"Due to the performance of the generation fleet, demand response providers and strong coordination with New York's transmission owners, we expect to meet Friday's peak demand and maintain operating reserve requirements," NYISO spokesman Ken Klapp said.

Regional power grid operators and utilities have not had to take any major steps to keep the lights on and air conditioners humming so far this week, despite the heat wave.

They have asked consumers to conserve power, defer non-essential equipment maintenance and activate demand response programs to reduce energy usage, but there have been no widespread blackouts, just some scattered outages.

NYISO said its demand response programs can reduce power usage by more than 1,250 MW, which may enable the system to avoid breaking the record peak usage on Friday.

ISO New England, which operates the power grid for the six New England states, said it also activated its demand response program, which can reduce usage by about 400 MW, for the first time this week on Friday as power supplies become tight with demand near record levels.

Demand response program participants are compensated for reducing electricity use - and could be penalized for not doing so - by raising air conditioner thermostats and turning off unnecessary lights and other equipment, including elevators, and operating on-site generators to reduce the amount of power needed from the grid.

The biggest power companies in New York include units of Con Edison, National Grid Plc, Iberdrola SA, Entergy Corp, TransCanada Corp and NRG Energy Inc.

The biggest power companies in New England include units of National Grid, Northeast Utilities, Iberdrola, NextEra Energy Inc, Dominion Resources Inc, Entergy and Exelon Corp.



headline: U.S. FCC moves to reform E-Rate subsidy for Internet at schools
byline: By Alina Selyukh
8:31am EDT

U.S. Federal Communications Commission moved on Friday to revamp a subsidy program aimed at bringing faster Internet to schools and libraries, after President Barack Obama's plea for a swifter transition to the digital era.

The FCC voted to propose various changes to how schools apply for and spend funds from the E-Rate program; for instance ensuring that the program would prioritize investments in faster broadband connections over some older technologies it also supports.

Obama urged the FCC last month to expand the E-Rate program so that 99 percent of U.S. schools would have access to high-speed broadband and wireless Internet within five years to spur use of digital technology in the classrooms.

"Today, the Federal Communications Commission took a first, important step toward realizing our vision of making 21st century classrooms available to every student in America," Obama said in a statement on Friday.

E-Rate, created in 1997, helps schools and libraries get discounts on Internet services and digital devices.

Funded by fees Americans pay on their monthly phone bills, the program's spending has been around $2 billion a year - $2.38 billion for 2013-2014 - but demand has more than twice exceeded that amount, FCC officials say.

Schools and libraries are clamoring for faster Internet speeds to promote digital learning, which is shown to improve test scores and graduation rates. Such skills are seen as critical for the future of the U.S. economy in a world where digital is the standard for classrooms.

"We've yet to realize the full potential (of E-Rate) to transform how the education is defined," former Education Secretary Margaret Spellings told the FCC on Friday. "The program should be aligned with today's technology."

And while most experts agree on the benefits and need to modernize E-Rate, opinions differ on how to fund the reforms.

Obama's plan suggested a temporary increase in the phone bill fees that finance E-Rate for an infusion of several billion dollars while FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai has cautioned against growing the program and instead urged focus on efficiencies.

"We should be mindful that expanding the program is not the same as reform," Pai, a Republican, said on Friday.

With Friday's proposal, the FCC seeks public input on scores of issues involved in updating E-Rate, including how to maximize cost effectiveness of purchases made through the program.

Other broad goals set by the proposal include a simpler, faster process of applying for funds, with speedier FCC reviews, and focus on improving broadband capacity by phasing out support for old services such as paging.

"We are quickly moving from a world where what matters is connectivity to what matters is capacity," said FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel.

Rosenworcel, a Democrat who had worked for one of the original E-Rate authors, Senator Jay Rockefeller, has proposed setting goals for Internet speeds in U.S. classrooms: 100 megabits per student by the 2015 school year and 1 Gigabit per 1,000 students by the end of the decade.

headline: Judge weighs rights of U.S. citizens in drone strikes
byline: By David Ingram
8:31am EDT

A federal judge fired difficult questions at the Obama administration and at civil liberties lawyers on Friday in a court case about whether U.S. citizens abroad targeted in drone strikes can seek compensation from the government.

At a hearing in U.S. District Court in Washington, Judge Rosemary Collyer said she would rule as soon as she could, at least on the preliminary question of whether citizens or their family members have a right to bring a lawsuit.

The U.S. government acknowledged in May that it had killed four Americans in drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan since 2009 as part of its campaign against al Qaeda and affiliated groups.

The families of three of those killed, including New Mexico-born militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, are suing over their deaths. They argue the killings were illegal.

In a courtroom so full that people stood in the back, Collyer openly struggled with what role U.S. courts should have in overseeing the highly secretive targeted-killing program run by President Barack Obama and his senior staff.

She reacted skeptically to U.S. Justice Department lawyer Brian Hauck, who urged Collyer to leave the program's work to the military and the White House. "The executive is not an effective check on the executive when it comes to a person's constitutional rights," Collyer said.

To civil liberties lawyers who argued the killings took place away from active hostilities, Collyer said that the United States is at war against a diffuse group of militants without a clearly defined battleground.

"There is no doubt that al Qaeda attacked the United States in 2001, and that the organization has called for continued attacks against U.S. interests around the world," she said.

The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, both based in New York, represent the families.

Hina Shamsi and Pardiss Kebriaei, lawyers for the groups respectively, said that in killing the Americans the government violated fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution to due process and to be free from unreasonable seizure.

The lawyers also said that for those rights to be meaningful for U.S. citizens, the families of those killed must be able to assert those rights in a courtroom.

Collyer countered that the lawsuit was highly unusual, and she wondered what documents the ACLU and Center for Constitutional Rights might demand from the government if she allowed the lawsuit to move forward.



headline: Rocket blasts off from Florida with military communications satellite
byline: By Irene Klotz
8:31am EDT

An Atlas 5 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Friday carrying a sophisticated communications satellite designed to provide voice and data services for U.S. military forces around the world.

The 206-foot (63-meter) tall rocket, built and operated by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, lifted off at 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) from a seaside launch pad just south of the Kennedy Space Center.

Perched on top of the booster was the second satellite in the U.S. Navy's Mobile User Objective System, or MUOS, network. The satellites, built by Lockheed Martin, are intended to augment and eventually replace the Navy's existing Ultra High Frequency satellites.

Those UHF spacecraft provide 2.4 kilobytes per second of digital voice only. MUOS spacecraft provide 348 kilobytes per second and adds data transmission capability.

The network, which will include four operational spacecraft and one on-orbit spare, is intended to bring 3G-cellular technology to ships at sea, submarines, aircraft, land vehicles and troops in the field.

"You can think of the satellites as the cell towers in the sky," Lockheed Martin vice president Iris Bombelyn told reporters during a prelaunch conference call. "That's a really good way to think of how the system works."

Weighing in at nearly 15,000 pounds (6,804 kg), MUOS satellites are the heaviest payloads to have flown on Atlas 5 rockets, which are outfitted with five strap-on solid fuel boosters to accommodate the load.

The first MUOS satellite was launched in 2012. MUOS 3 is targeted to launch in 2014, followed by MUOS 4 in 2015 and MUOS 5 after that.

The new satellite will spend about eight days adjusting its orbit so that it circles about 22,300 miles above Earth. It will then unfurl its solar panel wings and deploy two antennas to begin on-orbit checkouts prior to being put into service sometime next year.



headline: Hobby Lobby wins a stay against birth control mandate
byline: By Jonathan Stempel
8:31am EDT

A federal judge has temporarily exempted Hobby Lobby Stores Inc from a requirement in the 2010 healthcare law that it offer workers insurance coverage for birth control, which the retailer said violated its religious beliefs.

The preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Joe Heaton in Oklahoma City, where Hobby Lobby is based, covers the arts and crafts chain and its affiliated Mardel Christian bookstore chain.

He put the case on hold until October 1, giving the federal government time to decide whether to appeal a June 27 decision by a federal appeals court in Denver to let Hobby Lobby challenge the mandate on religious grounds.

A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman had no immediate comment. The government has said contraception coverage is needed to promote public health and gender equality.

The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a nonprofit law firm representing Hobby Lobby, said there are 63 lawsuits nationwide challenging the mandate.

It said Hobby Lobby is the largest company to be excused, at least temporarily, from having to comply. Hobby Lobby has 556 stores in 45 U.S. states, and has about 13,000 employees.

The Green family, which owns Hobby Lobby, had argued that providing coverage to workers for the morning-after pill and similar contraceptives violated its Christian beliefs.

It also said it could have under Obamacare faced $1.3 million in daily fines by not providing such coverage.

In a written order, Heaton said the size of those penalties, the "substantial" public policy issues involved, and the amount of similar litigation justified an injunction for Hobby Lobby.

"There is a substantial public interest in ensuring that no individual or corporation has their legs cut out from under them while these difficult issues are resolved," Heaton said at a hearing, according to the Becket Fund.

In its June 27 ruling, the Denver appeals court said there was a good chance that Hobby Lobby would ultimately prevail.

It said Hobby Lobby had "drawn a line at providing coverage for drugs or devices they consider to induce abortions, and it is not for us to question whether the line is reasonable."

Lori Windham, senior counsel for the Becket Fund, said in an interview that Heaton's decision "shows that companies can be protected from the mandate, and continue to exercise their religious beliefs in the way they run their businesses."

The case is Hobby Lobby Stores Inc et al v. Sebelius et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Oklahoma, No. 12-01000.

profile government leak case.

The ruling by the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is a win for the Obama administration, but it could hurt efforts by Attorney General Eric Holder to improve relations with the media. The Justice Department last week pledged to tighten its criteria for targeting journalists in leak cases.

Two other cases sparked a media outcry earlier this year about whether the Justice Department had been overzealous in investigating government leaks and had infringed on the right of free speech.

Prosecutors sought the testimony of reporter James Risen, author of a book, "State of War," that contained information the government believed was leaked by former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling.

In 2010, Sterling was indicted on ten charges relating to Risen's book, including unauthorized retention and communication of national defense information.

The following year, Holder authorized the Justice Department to issue a subpoena seeking Risen's testimony. Risen challenged the subpoena, saying he could not be compelled to testify under the First Amendment and federal common law.

In Friday's ruling, a three-judge panel ruled on a 2-1 vote that there is no so-called "reporter's privilege" under the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, meaning journalists do not receive special treatment.

"The reporter must appear and give testimony just as every other citizen must," wrote Chief Judge William Traxler. "We are not at liberty to conclude otherwise."

Judge Roger Gregory dissented, saying the majority had interpreted the law in a way that was "contrary to the will and wisdom," of the United States' founding fathers.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. Risen's attorney, Joel Kurtzberg, said he was disappointed with the ruling and that he and his client are "evaluating our next steps."

court brief in support of Risen.

MEDIA OUTCRY

Friday's ruling comes one week after the Justice Department issued new guidelines that would curb the ability of prosecutors to seize reporters' records when investigating leaks.

In a recent case that prompted concerns among the media, prosecutors obtained a warrant to search Fox News correspondent James Rosen's emails. He was named a "co-conspirator" in a federal leaks probe involving his reporting on North Korea.

In the other case that attracted attention, the Justice Department seized Associated Press phone records without prior notification as part of a probe into leaks about a 2012 Yemen-based plot to bomb a U.S. airliner.

headline: 'Whitey' Bulger sidekick recalls bloody 1960s Boston gang war
byline: By Daniel Lovering
8:31am EDT

A former sidekick of mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger recounted on Friday Boston's "out of control" gang war in the 1960s that left about 60 people dead and set the stage for Bulger's "Winter Hill" gang to take control of the city's crime scene.

Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi recalled shooting a man six times at a bus stop and helping to bury bodies at a gun club in a town outside Boston. He said that gangs used the war as an excuse to kill and agreed with federal prosecutor Fred Wyshak that things "got out of control."

Flemmi fled the city in 1971, living in Montreal for three years. When he returned to his hometown in 1974, he took up with Bulger, whom he admired for having a strict health regimen that stood out among gangsters.

"He didn't drink, he didn't smoke, he worked out regularly," Flemmi said of Bulger. "We both had that in common."

The two worked together closely for the next two decades, seeing each other almost daily until Bulger fled, knowing the FBI was closing in on him.

Flemmi stuck around and got arrested. He is currently serving a life sentence in prison after confessing to 10 murders alongside Bulger.

Bulger, 83, faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted on charges including racketeering, drug dealing and 19 killings he is accused of committing or ordering in the 1970s and 1980s.

He has pleaded not guilty on all charges, though his lawyer has admitted that Bulger was a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark, in short, an "organized criminal."

The long-awaited trial has brought back memories of a different time in Boston's history, when thugs from the tight-knit Irish community of South Boston ran their criminal enterprise with impunity, having bought off protection from the FBI and some local police.

Some of the murders, described to the jury during the six weeks of trial, took place just blocks from the waterfront site that is now home to Boston's federal courthouse.

During his years running the gang, prosecutors say Bulger regularly met with a corrupt FBI official who developed a 700-page informant file as he turned a blind eye to Bulger's crimes in exchange for information on the Italian Mafia.

Bulger denies being an informant or "rat," insisting through his attorney that he paid for information but offered none of his own.

One of Bulger's victims, a constant presence at the trial and a possible witness, was found dead Wednesday in a suburb near Boston.

That man, Stephen Rakes, had owned a South Boston liquor store that he said Bulger's gang forced him to sell for an unfairly low price after they threatened him with a gun during a meeting in 1984.

After accepting Bulger's money, Rakes took his family out of town on vacation but the gangster ordered him to return to the neighborhood and stand on street corners for two days to put to rest rumors that he had been whacked.

Authorities said on Thursday they were conducting an autopsy on Rakes' body, which showed no signs of trauma, and that it could take several weeks to complete toxicology reports and to confirm the cause of his death.

headline: Detroit files for bankruptcy, stage set for court fight
byline: By Nick Carey
8:31am EDT

Detroit filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history on Thursday, setting the stage for a costly court battle with creditors and opening a new chapter in the long struggle to revive the city that was the cradle of the American auto industry.

The bankruptcy, if approved by a federal judge, would force Detroit's thousands of creditors into negotiations with the city's Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr to resolve an estimated $18.5 billion in debt that has crippled Michigan's largest city.

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said he saw no other options for Detroit and approved Orr's request to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.

"Detroit simply cannot raise enough revenue to meet its current obligations, and that is a situation that is only projected to get worse absent a bankruptcy filing," wrote Snyder, a Republican, in a letter accompanying the filing.

Detroit's creditors are expected to face huge losses, and the future of retiree pension and health benefits for thousands of city workers hangs in the balance.

Anticipating the filing on Thursday, investors drove prices of Detroit bonds and notes lower, sending their yields to record highs on Thursday.

In some respects, Detroit's legacy as a model for American innovation is at stake as well. Its crippled condition threatens to overwhelm its image as the home of Henry Ford's pioneering assembly line and Motown's 1960s soul-music hit machine. More recently, the city has become an incubator for efforts to repopulate and reinvigorate an urban relic of a bygone, industrial age.

New York, Cleveland and Philadelphia previously teetered on bankruptcy, but Detroit is the first major U.S. city to go over the edge.

Detroit has lost 25 percent of its population in the last decade, with just 700,000 residents remaining. The ranks of retirees outnumber the city's active workers by more than a 2-1 ratio. With a quarter of its buildings abandoned in some neighborhoods, no other American city has borne the brunt of deindustrialization so heavily.

In his July 16 letter to the governor making the case for a bankruptcy filing, Orr laid bare the scope of the city's decline.

"After decades of fiscal mismanagement; plummeting population, employment and revenues; decaying City infrastructure... Detroit today is a shell of the thriving metropolis that it once was," Orr wrote.

WHITE HOUSE MONITORING

Snyder named Orr in March to tackle the city's spiraling long-term debt, which is estimated at $18.5 billion.

A White House spokeswoman said Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama and his senior team were monitoring the situation in Detroit closely. But unlike after the economic collapse of 2008, in which the federal government injected billions in cash into U.S. auto makers General Motors Co and Chrysler as the first step of a quick turn through a managed bankruptcy process, Obama made no promises this time.

"While leaders on the ground in Michigan and the city's creditors understand that they must find a solution to Detroit's serious financial challenge, we remain committed to continuing our strong partnership with Detroit...," White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage said.

Detroit was once synonymous with U.S. manufacturing prowess. Its automotive giants switched production to planes, tanks and munitions during World War Two, earning the city the nickname of the "Arsenal of Democracy."

Now the city's name has become synonymous with decline, decay and crime. A population that peaked at 1.8 million in the 1950s has fallen steadily since then. Manufacturing job losses and an exodus of white residents to the suburbs, which accelerated after race riots in the 1960s, have left huge swaths of this 80 percent black city blighted and crime-ridden.

Pay cuts and job reductions in the city's police and fire departments have added to the sense of insecurity. Budget cuts have left streetlights broken, fire hydrants out of order, and cop cars and fire trucks badly in need of repair.

The city's murder rate is at its highest in nearly 40 years; only a third of Detroit's ambulances were in service in the first quarter of 2013; and an estimated 5,000 buildings a year intentionally are set on fire.

To compound the challenges, a crime wave in city government has compromised efforts to recover. In just one high-profile case, former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick sits in prison, after he and associates were convicted of public corruption and systematic bid rigging.

The private sector has sought to make inroads against the crushing problems. Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert in 2010 began moving more than 7,000 jobs downtown, and several Detroit-based foundations have begun targeted investment in small local firms, neighborhoods and public schools.

But despite high taxes, the city's coffers have continued to dwindle.

In June, the city's emergency manager, Orr, presented a proposal to creditors offering them pennies on the dollar. His plan had met with resistance from some creditors, most notably Detroit's two pension funds representing retired city workers. The funds recently filed lawsuits in a state court challenging the governor's ability to authorize Orr to file for bankruptcy.

LONG ROAD AHEAD

Creditors are expected to mount a stiff challenge to the bankruptcy, which was filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Eastern District of Michigan.

Douglas Bernstein, a bankruptcy attorney at Plunkett Cooney in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, said he expected the case would last one to three years and would be very costly.

"This could run to tens-of-millions to hundreds-of-millions of dollars," he said.

Orr has said previously that he hoped Detroit could emerge from bankruptcy in a year or less. During a press conference in Detroit on Thursday after the bankruptcy filing, he said he hoped Detroit would emerge from bankruptcy by late summer or fall in 2014.

"We are planning to get through this process as expeditiously as possible," said Orr, an experienced bankruptcy lawyer before he took the emergency manager job.

Corporate bankruptcy filings with far less at stake have taken much longer than Orr's targeted timeline. Richard Ciccarone, managing director of McDonnell Investment Management, said it would be a long, drawn out process.

"They're dealing with very difficult issues in which there's not very much court precedent for a major city in this arena," he said.

While thousands of companies have gone through bankruptcy and emerged intact, only a relative handful American cities have made Chapter 9 filings since the Bankruptcy Act was amended in 1934 to include municipalities. The paucity of precedent and sheer number of creditors portend a complicated road ahead.

"It's a very complex landscape and it's one that's going to be watched very closely by municipal investors," said Robert Amodeo, a portfolio manager at Western Asset in New York.

General Motors, the only major U.S. automaker headquartered in Detroit, said in a statement that the company "is proud to call Detroit home and...(this is) a day that we and others hoped would not come. We believe, however, that today also can mark a clean start for the city."

Ford Motor Co, which is based in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, said it was "optimistic that governmental leaders will be successful in strengthening the community."

But Ed McNeil, chief negotiator for a coalition of 33 unions that represent most of the service workers for the city of Detroit said the bankruptcy filing was about "busting the unions."

"I've said all along that this is a power grab," said McNeil. "This is not about fixing the city's finances. It's about the governor and his own agenda to take over the city of Detroit."

Firefighters on Thursday held back a wildfire in the mountains of Southern California that forced the evacuation of the resort community of Idyllwild after flames engulfed seven homes and numerous other buildings.

The so-called Mountain Fire has charred more than 22,800 acres of drought-parched chaparral and timber, much of it in steep, remote wilderness terrain inside the San Bernardino National Forest, according to the U.S. Forest Service.

The blaze erupted on Monday afternoon about 100 miles east of Los Angeles in the scenic San Jacinto Mountains that overlook Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and several smaller desert towns.

"The town of Idyllwild is still the main concern at this point," said Carol Underhill, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Forest Service.

Underhill said firefighters on Thursday made progress in reinforcing a defensive line on a ridge between the flames and Idyllwild, a resort community known for hiking, mountain climbing and its arts and culture scene.

About 6,000 local residents remained under evacuation orders on Thursday, Underhill said. Idyllwild, the adjacent community of Fern Valley and the neighboring village of Pine Cove have a combined population of more than 3,800 people and nearly 1,700 households, according to the latest census.

No evacuation orders have been put in place for Palm Springs, which is about 4 miles from the fire. The city is home to 46,000 people and is known for its trendy shopping scene. It was once a getaway for Hollywood stars like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby.

Smoke has wafted into Palm Springs, leading authorities on Thursday to issue an air quality alert for the city and nearby communities, Underhill said.

Nearly 3,000 firefighters, 17 water-dropping helicopters and 10 air tankers have been assigned to battle the blaze. The fire ranks as one of the most severe of about 16 large wildfires that crews are trying to contain in several western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.

As of Thursday evening, firefighters had managed to hold their containment lines around 15 percent of its perimeter, officials said in a statement.

No injuries have been reported, but authorities say seven residences, including three mobile homes, have been destroyed, along with one commercial structure, more than a dozen outbuildings and several vehicles.



headline: Detroit raced to file bankruptcy ahead of move to block it

Detroit's historic municipal bankruptcy filing on Thursday came less than 10 minutes before lawyers for the city's pension funds and retirees had rushed to another court to try to block it.

The bare bones bankruptcy petition, which came at 4:06:22 p.m., blindsided everyone in the room, according to two lawyers who were in state court in Lansing, Michigan, at the time. Even the lawyer representing the governor and the judge were caught unaware.

"I think everybody was surprised," said Bill Wertheimer, an attorney for a group of current and retired Detroit city workers who filed a lawsuit early this month to try to block any bankruptcy.

"The attorney general, he claimed to know nothing about it, like he was deaf, dumb and blind," said Wertheimer, who is paid by the United Auto Workers. "The judge was clearly taken aback."

The largest-ever municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history puts at risk the future of retiree pension and health benefits for thousands of city workers.

Although city retirement benefits are enshrined in Michigan's constitution, Kevyn Orr, the city's state-appointed emergency manager, outlined a plan for creditors that would include significant cuts in pension payments.

In a bid to safeguard the benefits of Detroit retirees, workers and pension funds filed lawsuits challenging the authority of Republican Governor Rick Snyder to authorize a bankruptcy proceeding.

Even after the bankruptcy filing had popped up on a federal court website, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina still issued a temporary restraining order on any further action by Snyder and Orr in the bankruptcy case pending a hearing, according to a copy of the order obtained by Reuters.

That hearing could come as soon as Friday, according to Aquilina's law clerk.

In the hours following the bankruptcy filing, officials for the UAW and other unions said Snyder and Orr had falsely conveyed the impression a filing would not come soon. UAW general counsel Michael Nicholson said papers filed in Ingham court earlier in the week suggested bankruptcy was not imminent.

In that filing on Monday, the state had said an effort to prevent a bankruptcy filing was "premature, overbroad and constitutionally infirm." The state added that concerns a bankruptcy could wipe out their pensions were "not ripe" and based on events "that may or may not occur."

"The bottom line is the governor is being duplicitous," Nicholson said. "You can prove that by looking at what they filed at court."

Orr disagreed with the assessment, telling reporters during a press conference Thursday that he had negotiated "in good faith."

"Quite frankly, I've bent over backward in the past three plus months to, as I said initially in this very room (on my) first day, to offer an olive branch, to reach out to constituencies," Orr told reporters Thursday.

Under a 2012 Michigan law, the governor must approve a Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing for a local government if that move is recommended by the state-appointed emergency manager running that government.

A hearing had been scheduled on Monday in Ingham County Circuit Court on the city workers' and retirees' challenge.

But attorneys for the Detroit's pension funds caught wind of a possible bankruptcy filing and on Wednesday sued Snyder and Orr to prevent them from filing for bankruptcy protection. They asked Judge Aquilina for an emergency hearing Thursday afternoon, Nicholson said.

The judge granted the order barring Snyder from authorizing or supporting the bankruptcy -- but it came minutes after the bankruptcy was filed.

"At the same time, we have Detroit having filed for bankruptcy," Wertheimer said. "Almost simultaneously we have a state court judge issuing an order telling the governor not to authorize the bankruptcy and not to do anything to support anything that is filed."

The state court order may be too late, according to W. Clark Watson, an attorney at Balch &amp; Bingham LLP, who co-wrote a municipal bankruptcy guide for public finance attorneys.

"I think that a state court order enjoining the proceedings in a federal bankruptcy court would be extraordinary, at best," Watson said, adding that federal bankruptcy would trump state law.

He added that Detroit's Thursday filing likely came down to "a race to the courthouse" as the city initially filed only a petition that lacked the reams of documents that usually accompany a filing on the day it reaches court.

"That is not necessarily any disadvantage to the city; just not the orderly process that its lawyers would have otherwise preferred," Watson said.

Some Detroit residents voiced skepticism on Thursday that the former U.S. manufacturing powerhouse would emerge in better shape from its historic bankruptcy filing designed to fix the city's financial crisis.

Hours after learning Detroit filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, residents spoke of the stark realities that come with living in a financially broken city.

"It was like putting a thumb in a dam," said Jodie Holmes, 55, as he leaned against an abandoned restaurant marked with graffiti, waiting for a bus to take him to his temporary job.

"I don't know if bankruptcy will help us or drop us to our knees," he added.

Detroit filed Chapter 9 bankruptcy in federal court on Thursday. The bankruptcy, if approved by a federal judge, would force Detroit's thousands of creditors into negotiations with the city's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, to resolve an estimated $18.5 billion in debt that has crippled Michigan's largest city.

Detroit was once synonymous with U.S. manufacturing prowess. Its automotive giants switched production to planes, tanks and munitions during World War Two, earning the city the nickname of the "Arsenal of Democracy."

Now a third of Detroit's 700,000 residents live in poverty and about a fifth are unemployed.

"Maybe bankruptcy will help. I don't know," said lifelong Detroiter Damien Collins, 68, outside his east-side house surrounded by abandoned homes.

The retired autoworker said he had given up hope anything would bring back Detroit.

"Nothing else has worked, so why not try it?" he asked.

Detroit's economic struggles have resulted in a deterioration of city life. The murder rate is the highest in nearly 40 years, only a third of its ambulances were in service in the first quarter of 2013 and nearly 78,000 abandoned buildings create "additional public safety problems," Michigan's Republican governor, Rick Snyder, wrote in a letter accompanying the filing.

Residents have also had to cope with a breakdown of services. Forty percent of street lights were non-functional in the first three months of this year, while the police took an average of 58 minutes to respond to emergency calls, more than five times the national average. The city government has also been plagued by mismanagement and political corruption.

"Detroit has a lot to offer, but we need a clean sweep of politicians," said Joanna Maslach, 30, a restaurant manager. "There's still too much corruption here. It's too dysfunctional."

Jim Fields, 37, who recently moved to a downtown loft from the suburbs, is one who believes the city is poised for a comeback. He is among a growing number of professionals moving to historic buildings converted into loft spaces.

"Bankruptcy hits the reset button," the software engineer said. "It's a golden opportunity to make this city right again. I'm very hopeful."

A man convicted of killing his girlfriend's sister and a Texas Tech University associate dean was executed by lethal injection on Thursday, the second execution this week in Texas.

Vaughn Ross, 41, was pronounced dead at 6:38 p.m. CDT (2338 GMT) at a state prison in Huntsville, Texas, the state Department of Criminal Justice said in a statement.

The victims, Douglas Birdsall and Viola McVade, were found shot to death in January 2001 in Birdsall's car in a ravine in Lubbock, Texas, according to an account of the case from the state attorney general's office.

Birdsall, 53, and McVade, 18, both had been shot several times, the account said. McVade was the sister of Ross's girlfriend, and Birdsall was an associate dean of libraries at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.

Ross, who held a college degree from a Missouri university and was putting himself through architecture classes at Texas Tech, was convicted and sentenced to death in September 2002.

He pleaded not guilty to the charges, with his lawyers arguing he could not have committed the crime alone and that police had planted evidence.

Ross told prosecutors he had been fighting with McVade and had threatened her the night before her body was found, according to the attorney general's account.

After Ross gave police permission to search his house, investigators found a bloodstained sweatshirt with DNA from both Ross and Birdsall.

Inside Birdsall's car, a latex glove carried DNA that matched both men, and a large pool of blood in the alley behind Ross' apartment matched Birdsall's DNA. The car and bodies were found about four miles from Ross's home.

After his arrest, while he was in jail, Ross told his mother he "might have" committed the crime, the account said.

Ross, in a final statement, thanked his family and friends for their support and said he did not fear death, the department said in a statement.

"We know the lies they told in court," Ross was quoted as saying. "We know it's not true. I want you to be strong and keep going."

Ross was the 10th inmate executed in Texas and the 20th in the United States this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

On Tuesday, Texas executed John Manuel Quintanilla Jr for the murder of a man during a robbery at a game room.



headline: Florida lawmakers urge overhaul of 'Stand Your Ground' law
byline: By Tom Brown
8:31am EDT

defense law or enact sweeping changes to avert more tragedies like the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, Democratic leaders of the state's legislature said on Thursday.

A Seminole County jury on Saturday acquitted George Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter, with one juror citing Stand Your Ground as a factor in reaching her legal conclusion that Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, acted in self-defense.

The Zimmerman verdict demonstrated the ramifications of the 2005 law, Florida Senate Democratic leader Chris Smith said.

"This bill actually encourages people to shoot their way out of situations and that's not how we live in a civilized society," Smith told a news conference. "It's a mentality that has permeated the state of Florida. It's a mentality of shoot first, and we should not have that in a civilized society."

Smith was joined by Florida House Democratic leader Perry Thurston. Both called for a special session of the state's Republican-dominated legislature to overhaul the law or consider doing away with it.

Unless Florida lawmakers act quickly, calls for a boycott of the state like the one voiced by Motown legend Stevie Wonder are likely to grow as part of a mounting backlash, they warned. Civil rights groups also are calling for changes in the law.

With the state legislature in recess, Republican Governor Rick Scott would need to convene a special legislative session.

Dozens of young demonstrators have been occupying part of Scott's office in the Florida capital, Tallahassee, since Tuesday to press demands that he order the state's lawmakers back to work to toss out or modify the law.

Scott said he met with leaders of the sit-in demonstration for the first time on Thursday night, but he indicated he had no plans to call a special session.

The governor stressed, however, that the demonstrators had a "right to share their views with their state legislators and let them know their opinions on the law."

BALLOT INITIATIVE

Smith and other lawmakers tried to get the Stand Your Ground law changed in the past legislative session in Tallahassee but failed to get a committee hearing on the issue.

After the Martin shooting, Scott appointed a task force to examine the statute. The task force held seven hearings around the state before recommending to keep the law despite many calls for it to be repealed or amended.

"Tonight, the protesters again asked that I call a special session of the legislature to repeal Florida's Stand Your Ground law. I told them that I agree with the Task Force on Citizen Safety, which concurred with the law," Scott said in a statement.

Smith and Thurston said a ballot initiative was likely if the legislature failed to change the law, voicing confidence that public outrage over the verdict would help generate enough signatures to place the matter on the ballot.

According to the instructions given to the jury, Zimmerman had "no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force" if he reasonably feared for his life or great bodily harm.

Though the Stand Your Ground law was not specifically cited as part of the defense mounted by Zimmerman's lawyers, Smith said the jury instructions that helped pave the way for his acquittal came directly from the statute.

Smith and Thurston were joined at their news conference by Broward County State Attorney Michael Satz, who said he and other law enforcement officials supported calls for an urgent overhaul of the Stand Your Ground law.

"I think putting in the statute that you do not have the duty to retreat is a mistake. I think life is precious and before you do that you should do everything in your power not to do that and to retreat if you possibly can," Satz said.

"Before there was a common law duty that you had to retreat before you used deadly force," he added. "I just don't think you need the Stand Your Ground statute."

The Florida statute was adopted under former Republican Governor Jeb Bush. Many other states, acting with broad support from the National Rifle Association, have followed Florida's lead over the last seven years.

campus system that led to six arrests.

Several demonstrators were forcibly removed from a meeting room at the University of California at San Francisco before the Board of Regents voted to approve Napolitano as head of the sprawling UC system at a base salary of $570,000 per year.

The students, angry over Napolitano's immigration policies as Homeland Security chief, shouted "undocumented is not a crime!" as they were handcuffed by campus police and led from the room, briefly halting the confirmation hearing.

Some two dozen people yelled "Shame! Shame! Shame!" during a public comment portion of the meeting and two of them tried to rush toward tables where board members sat before being restrained by police officers. Others gathered outside to protest against Napolitano's approval of immigration issues and her lack of experience in education.

University of California spokeswoman Elizabeth Fernandez said six people were arrested during the meeting for unlawful assembly and disturbing the peace.

"I would say to those students, documented or undocumented, we welcome all students to the University of California," Napolitano, 55, told a news conference after the vote. "We're in the business of education and I will be an advocate for that."

Napolitano also said she was taking a 10 percent pay cut from the salary earned by her predecessor, Mark Yudof, because "I've been in public service for over 20 years and you do this job for the passion of the work."

LIGHTNING ROD

The former two-term Democratic governor of Arizona becomes the first woman to lead the University of California in its 145-year history.

She assumes oversight of 10 campuses making up what has long been regarded one of the top U.S. public university systems but which has been battered by nearly two decades of boom-and-bust-funding, leading to tuition increases and classroom shortages.

The financial crunch has strained relations with faculty and staff who have been hit with furloughs and hiring freezes.

"We all feel extremely excited about this as she brings fresh eyes to the UC system," Regent Sherry Lansing said before the vote. "She's had a lifetime of public service ... I think education is actually in her DNA."

The lone vote against Napolitano's appointment was cast by student Regent Cinthia Flores.

Napolitano, a former two-term Arizona governor and Democrat, has been a lightning rod in the Obama administration for criticism by conservatives, who have accused her most recently of being soft on border control and immigration issues.

Latino leaders, meanwhile, have sharply criticized Napolitano for immigration sweeps that led to large-scale detention and deportations involving undocumented immigrants.

"Janet Napolitano isn't qualified at all to be UC president, her background is in law and immigration enforcement. It worries me as an undocumented student to have a UC President who has put terror into my family," said demonstrator Rosa Hernandez, a 21-year-old student at the University of California at Berkeley.

Napolitano has acknowledged she was not a typical candidate and said she would meet with faculty, students, politicians and others to learn about the system. She was credited with championing public education during her tenure as governor of Arizona.



headline: Detroit files for bankruptcy, stage set for court fight
byline: By Nick Carey
8:31am EDT

ever municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history on Thursday, marking a new low for a city that was the cradle of the U.S. automotive industry and setting the stage for a costly court battle with creditors.

The bankruptcy, if approved by a federal judge, would force Detroit's thousands of creditors into negotiations with the city's Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr to resolve an estimated $18.5 billion in debt that has crippled Michigan's largest city.

The future of retiree pension and health benefits for thousands of city workers hangs in the balance.

Anticipating the filing, investors drove prices of Detroit bonds and notes lower, sending their yields to record highs on Thursday.

In a letter accompanying the filing, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said he had approved a request from Orr to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection noting, "Detroit simply cannot raise enough revenue to meet its current obligations, and that is a situation that is only projected to get worse absent a bankruptcy filing."

Speaking on Channel 4 Detroit after the announcement, Snyder, a Republican, said, "Let's stop the decline. Let's get to stability. Let's get things working in the right direction."

Snyder named Orr in March to tackle the city's spiraling long-term debt, which is estimated at $18.5 billion.

A White House spokeswoman said Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama and his senior team were monitoring the situation in Detroit closely.

"While leaders on the ground in Michigan and the city's creditors understand that they must find a solution to Detroit's serious financial challenge, we remain committed to continuing our strong partnership with Detroit...," White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage said.

Detroit was once synonymous with U.S. manufacturing prowess. Its automotive giants switched production to planes, tanks and munitions during World War Two, earning the city the nickname of the "Arsenal of Democracy."

Now the city's name has become synonymous with decline, decay and crime. Detroit has seen its population fall to 700,000 from a peak of 1.8 million people in 1950. The city's government has been beset by corruption cases over the years. Waning investment in street lights and emergency services has left it struggling to police the streets.

The city's murder rate is at its highest in nearly 40 years; only a third of its ambulances were in service in the first quarter of 2013; and its nearly 78,000 abandoned buildings create "additional public safety problems and reduces the quality of life in the city," the governor noted in his letter.

In June, Orr presented a proposal to creditors offering them pennies on the dollar. His plan had met with resistance from some creditors, most notably Detroit's two pension funds representing retired city workers. The funds recently filed lawsuits in a state court challenging the governor's ability to authorize Orr to file for bankruptcy.

LONG ROAD AHEAD

Creditors are expected to mount a stiff challenge to the bankruptcy, which was filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Eastern District of Michigan.

Douglas Bernstein, a bankruptcy attorney at Plunkett Cooney in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, said he expected the case would last one-to-three years and would be very costly.

"This could run to tens-of-millions to hundreds-of-millions of dollars," he said.

Unlike corporate bankruptcies, there have been relatively few Chapter 9 cases since the Bankruptcy Act was amended in 1934 to include municipalities. This means there is little precedent and the number of creditors means a complicated road ahead.

"It's a very complex landscape and it's one that's going to be watched very closely by municipal investors," said Robert Amodeo, a portfolio manager at Western Asset in New York.

General Motors, the only major U.S. automaker headquartered in Detroit, said in a statement that the company "is proud to call Detroit home and...(this is) a day that we and others hoped would not come. We believe, however, that today also can mark a clean start for the city."

Ford Motor Co, which is based in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, said it was "optimistic that governmental leaders will be successful in strengthening the community."

But Ed McNeil, chief negotiator for a coalition of 33 unions that represent most of the service workers for the city of Detroit said the bankruptcy filing was about "busting the unions."

"I've said all along that this is a power grab," said McNeil. "This is not about fixing the city's finances. It's about the governor and his own agenda to take over the city of Detroit."

In the municipal bond market, Detroit bonds and notes traded on Thursday at record high yields, said Dominic Vonella, managing analyst at Municipal Market Data, a unit of Thomson Reuters.

The taxable June 15 2035 bonds traded at $38.5 with a yield of 16 percent. That compares with $76 and a yield of 8.39 percent in mid-May.

as a "powerful" tool to right Detroit's ship.

A comparison with Chapter 11, the statute for corporate bankruptcy, shows just how much power a Chapter 9 debtor has.

Unlike in Chapter 11, judges in municipal bankruptcies cannot tell a debtor what to do with its money. While judges can order bankrupt companies to liquidate assets or force a debtor to sell a home, they have no power to tell a city to sell property or hike taxes to satisfy debts.

Creditors of bankrupt municipalities cannot submit restructuring plans. That right belongs exclusively to the municipality, unlike in Chapter 11, where creditors can propose competing plans after 180 days.

Provisions halting litigation against a bankrupt entity are broader in Chapter 9 than in Chapter 11, and it is not as easy to remove an elected official as it is to oust an executive of a bankrupt corporation.

In a distinction that could prove key in Detroit's heavily labor-driven insolvency, Chapter 9 allows a debtor to abrogate its pension and labor terms if good faith negotiations fail. In Chapter 11, a company can only walk away from labor contracts if it can convince a judge the cuts are absolutely necessary.

"It kind of goes to the role of the sovereign," said Randye Soref, a bankruptcy expert at law firm Polsinelli. "The rationale is that no one should interfere with the sovereign's ability to govern."

Chapter 9 is rare, but has produced a number of high-profile cases of late, including three in California last year. Alabama's Jefferson County filed for bankruptcy in 2011 with $4.2 billion in debt, while Central Falls, Rhode Island, filed the same year to address an $80 million unfunded pension liability.

While the Chapter 9 statute keeps Orr in the driver's seat of Detroit's restructuring, it also has its limitations. From a practical standpoint, the statute is little more than a glorified bargaining tool, because courts have little power to force compromise that parties do not hash out on their own.

So, while Orr could take drastic steps like crush Detroit's labor contingent, it would behoove him to compromise.

"It's a political process," said Bill Brandt, a restructuring expert at Development Specialists Inc.

Lawyers and other professionals looking to make money from Detroit's collapse should take note of one other crucial difference: unlike in Chapter 11, which puts a premium on transparency, professionals in Chapter 9 are not required to publicize or get court approval of fee payments.

In Chapter 11, creditors, judges and regulators from the Department of Justice pore over every detail of a professional's bill, raising objections to items they deem overpriced or unnecessary. In Chapter 9, bills can stay between a law firm and its client.

It's akin to the "Wild West," said one bankruptcy lawyer who refused to be named.

"You're used to being in a world where you have to explain yourself," the lawyer said, "and suddenly you don't anymore."

headline: Judge in U.S. WikiLeaks case declines to dismiss charge of aiding enemy
byline: By Medina Roshan
8:31am EDT

martial of the U.S. soldier accused of the biggest leak of classified material in the nation's history refused on Thursday to dismiss the most severe charge the defendant faces, aiding the enemy.

That is one of 21 counts that U.S. Army Private First Class Bradley Manning is charged with, but it carries the possibility of life in prison.

"He was knowingly providing intelligence to the enemy," said Judge Colonel Denise Lind in rejecting a motion by Manning's lawyer to dismiss that charge.

Lind said military intelligence analysts such as Manning were trained to assume that anything posted on the Internet could be accessed by the enemy.

Manning, 25, is charged with sharing more than 700,000 classified files, combat videos and State Department cables with the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks while serving as a low-level intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010.

The case stands as a test of the limits of secrecy in the Internet era. Manning's lawyers have sought to portray him as naive but well-meaning, intending to provoke debate by providing Americans with more information about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

He acted through the WikiLeaks site, founded by activist Julian Assange, who has drawn the anger of the U.S. government, which charged that the leaks put national security and intelligence operatives at risk.

More than three years after Manning's arrest in May 2010, the U.S. intelligence community is reeling again from leaked secrets, this time exposed by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.

Snowden has been holed up in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, seeking a country to offer him asylum.

NEGLIGENCE, NOT ILL INTENT

Defense lawyer David Coombs earlier this week had argued that Manning was guilty of negligence but not the "general evil intent" standard required to justify the heavy charge.

Coombs also argued that the government was overreaching by charging his client with stealing information from a government database.

"The government is trying to say that the word database encapsulates everything under the sun," Coombs said. "Words matter."

On Thursday, the judge heard from prosecution witnesses in a rebuttal phase that was scheduled to continue at 9:30 a.m. EDT (1:30 p.m. GMT) on Friday. Much of the testimony focused on technical details about computer programs, which the prosecution said would prove that Manning violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by exceeding his authorized access. The defense maintains he acted within legal limits.

A top U.S. defense official told a security forum in Aspen, Colorado, on Thursday that the government is overhauling the way it stores information to prevent leaks similar to those orchestrated by Snowden or Manning.

Snowden has provided documents about secret U.S. and British eavesdropping programs to Britain's Guardian newspaper, the German magazine Der Spiegel and the Washington Post. He also made allegations about U.S. eavesdropping on Chinese targets to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.

headline: Appeals court hears arguments in Florida's 'Docs v. Glocks' case
byline: By Zachary Fagenson
8:31am EDT

Efforts to reinstate a Florida law that bars doctors from asking patients about gun ownership, had doctors arguing in an appellate court hearing on Thursday that such a ban would violate their First Amendment rights.

A lawyer for the state countered that the law, which was struck down by federal judge last year, recommends that doctors not ask patients about gun ownership but would not ban such questions.

Lawyers representing doctors and others in the so-called "Docs v. Glocks" case argued that U.S. Judge Marcia Cooke's 2012 decision should stand as the law violated health care providers' First Amendment rights by threatening them with heavy fines and the possibility of losing their license should they broach the subject.

Doctors say they ask about gun ownership as a normal part of screening new patients, including it on long list of health questions about drug and alcohol use, smoking, exercise and eating habits.

"The legislature perceived the question as a political attack on gun ownership and set out to stop it," Douglas Hallward-Driemeier, a Miami attorney representing doctors and other groups, told the three-judge panel. The law "singles out the speech most protected by privacy."

Allen Winsor, a lawyer from the Florida Attorney General's office, said the law's language doesn't force doctors to do anything.

"The legislature said should, not must, not shall," he argued. "They were not mandating, but making a recommendation."

Judge Gerald Tjoflat's suggested that if the 2011 Firearm Owners' Privacy Act is repealed it would free the government to find gun owners through online medical records.

That information "goes to Uncle Sam in Washington and now everything the patient has said is at the government's disposal," said Tjoflat.

But doctors say confidentiality always applies. "I can't release any records unless there's a subpoena," Dr. Bernd Wollschlaeger, a family physician who was the lead plaintiff in the 2012 suit that led to the law being overturned, told reporters after the hearing.

Florida's Republican-led legislature passed the law after a north Florida couple complained that a doctor asked them if they had guns, and refused to see them after they declined to answer. When the law was ruled unconstitutional in 2012, with a federal judge saying it did not infringe on Second Amendment rights, Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state's health department quickly appealed the decision.

Critics of the law say the state's appeal is driven by the National Rifle Association and the gun industry to prevent regulations.

"This law is an unprecedented attempt by industry to silence the medical community about the risks posed by their products," said Jonathan Lowy, director of the Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. "It would set a very dangerous precedent, that a destructive industry can simply buy the silence of a community through a misguided law."

Doctors, meanwhile, said the law is a hindrance to providing patients the best care possible.

When a patient comes in for a first time visit, "we ask all kinds of things," Dr. Judy Schaechter told reporters, citing issues such as medical history, mood issues, and drug problems. It was by "asking that question that I found out a teen patient had a gun and was trying desperately to get out of a gang," she said.



headline: Georgia judge extends execution stay, allows challenge to secrecy law
byline: By David Beasley
8:31am EDT

A Georgia judge indefinitely extended a stay of execution on Thursday for condemned killer Warren Lee Hill that will allow him to challenge a new law shielding the identity and methods of the company that makes the state's lethal injection drugs.

State attorneys will ask the Georgia Supreme Court to lift the stay and allow the execution to proceed on Friday evening. If the stay is lifted, Hill could become the first Georgia prisoner executed with drugs obtained in secret.

If the court declines to act, Hill's punishment could be delayed for months while the law is challenged. That could similarly affect other executions in the state, defense attorney Brian Kammer told Reuters.

Hill, 53, was sentenced to die for fatally beating another inmate in 1990 while serving a life term for killing his girlfriend. His execution had been scheduled for earlier this week but was delayed for Thursday's hearing.

The new Georgia law, which went into effect on July 1, allows the state to conceal the source of lethal injection drugs from the public, attorneys and judges in court proceedings.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Gail Tusan ruled on Thursday that Hill's attorneys were "likely to prevail" on the challenge to the new law, which has never been tested in court.

It was passed in March by legislators concerned about the dwindling supplies of pentobarbital, the injection drug, amid pressure by anti-death penalty advocates on companies that provide lethal injection drugs to the state, attorneys said.

State attorneys said the law was designed to protect those companies from harassment and lawsuits, but defense attorneys argued the law makes it impossible to determine whether a drug has been tainted with other substances that could cause excessive pain to the prisoner.

It is unconstitutional to execute a prisoner in a manner considered to be cruel and unusual punishment, but the law would prevent an inmate's ability to be protected under that provision, attorneys said.

"It could be made in a factory where they make pesticides," Kammer said. "If an execution was botched, the court can't even investigate what went wrong. They say to Mr. Hill, 'Just trust us.'"

State attorneys told Tusan that the dose of the single drug, pentobarbital, Georgia uses in lethal injections is so large that an inmate is rendered unconscious in a few seconds. Even if the drug were contaminated, it would not cause the prisoner undue pain, they said.

"They perish quite quickly," Sabrina Graham, a Georgia assistant attorney general, told Tusan during the hearing.

Georgia has nearly 100 inmates on its death row, some for several decades, according to the state's Department of Corrections website. Hill's is the only execution currently scheduled.

If the state Supreme Court agrees with Tusan's ruling, it could delay the other executions from being scheduled while the legal challenge moves through the courts, Kammer said.

In addition to challenging the constitutionality of the state law, Hill's lawyers have also filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court saying he should not be executed because he is mentally disabled.



headline: Private firm bets on marijuana, Wall Street wary
byline: By Eric M. Johnson and Alex Dobuzinskis
8:31am EDT

In the sparse Seattle offices of Privateer Holdings, Brendan Kennedy grabs an iPad to show how his bet on legal marijuana is already paying dividends in the form of a Google results page for "blue cheese."

When Web users search that term, high on the list is a link to reviews of the pot strain "blue cheese" on Leafly.com, the medical cannabis website Privateer bought a year and a half ago and which it calls the Yelp of weed.

"We've got Wikipedia blue cheese and pictures of blue cheese, and the third thing you see is the 'blue cheese' strain on Leafly," Kennedy said as he displayed the Google results page. He says Leafly produces revenue of over $100,000 a month.

Popular interest in marijuana and moves by Washington state and Colorado to legalize recreational pot have led Kennedy's two-year-old private equity firm and a handful of politically connected investors to dive into the pot business. The drug remains illegal under federal law.

Privateer this week said it closed a $7 million first round of fundraising. It also named to its board of directors Michael Auerbach, an investor with ties to former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

A next round of Privateer fundraising to begin in the fall will be not less than $25 million, Kennedy and Privateer CFO Michael Blue said in a statement.

With annual marijuana sales, both on the black market and in 18 states that allow the drug as medicine, estimated at $20 billion nationally according to Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron, businesses are seeking legal avenues to enter the industry.

Still, the $7 million raised by Privateer is small by the standards of private equity firms, which typically raise hundreds of millions of dollars per fund.

"The obstacle is it's not a legal product yet ... It's not legal under federal law," Miron said. "That's a huge impediment to being able to earn a profit or keep a profit."

Apart from Privateer, the only other fund raising money with the sole purpose of capitalizing on the fast-growing pot industry is Emerald Ocean Capital, a division of Southern California-based venture capital firm Ghost Group, said Josh Rosen, a former analyst at Credit Suisse who co-founded cannabis retailer consultant 4Front Advisors.

Rosen said Privateer appears to be the larger of the two.

2014 START

Washington state and Colorado are still tweaking their rules for the recreational-use pot business, which is slated to be up and running in both states next year.

Privateer says it will insulate itself from the risk of federal prosecution by investing in pot-related businesses not directly tied to U.S. production, distribution or sale of the drug.

"I'm not about to invest my personal funds in something that could get shut down tomorrow," said Auerbach, a senior adviser to global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, which is co-chaired by Albright.

Auerbach said he has not spoken to Albright about pot, but both Kennedy and Blue, who are Yale MBA graduates, have lobbied members of Congress for a more tolerant federal stand on cannabis.

A U.S. Department of Justice representative declined to comment on groups investing in pot-related businesses.

Kennedy said Privateer, which has raised funds from family offices and high net worth individuals, will look at investing in everything from light designers for indoor cannabis growing to makers of harvesting equipment and trimmers.

Others are making bolder choices. A senior political aide in Washington state, who declined to be named, hopes to leave his job to build a marijuana farm in wine-producing Walla Walla. He said he and several co-investors had pooled $250,000 and hoped for $2.3 million more from a venture capitalist.

In May, former Microsoft executive Jamen Shively announced plans, criticized as unrealistic because of the federal ban, to create a U.S. marijuana brand. He drew attention for winning political support from former Mexican President Vicente Fox.

Kevin Sabet, co-founder of Project SAM which opposes pot legalization, said the entry of large investors in the market was worrisome. "This is about profit maximization based on addiction," he said.

headline: Police link Indiana doctor with Omaha killings
byline: By Katie Schubert
8:31am EDT

Credit card charges, store surveillance video and possibly parts of a handgun all help connect a man described by police as fitting a serial killer's profile to the murders in May of an Omaha doctor and his wife, a police affidavit showed on Thursday.

Dr. Anthony J. Garcia, 40, has been charged with those killings and two 2008 murders that police have said were acts of revenge against two Creighton University doctors who fired him from a pathology residency in 2001 for unprofessional conduct.

Garcia, who lives in Indiana, was arrested on Monday in Illinois. His attorneys have told the Omaha World-Herald newspaper that he wanted to move forward to prove his innocence.

He is accused of killing Dr. Roger Brumback and his wife, Mary Brumback, both 65, who were found dead on May 14, each with stab wounds to the side of their necks and Dr. Brumback was also shot, the affidavit said.

Police said those stab wounds were similar to ones found in the 2008 murders of 11-year-old Thomas Hunter, the son of another Creighton doctor, and the family housekeeper, Shirlee Sherman, 57, the affidavit said.

Garcia was fired in 2001 by Dr. Brumback and Dr. William Hunter, and police have said they do not believe Hunter's son or housekeeper were intended targets.

Witnesses in 2008 reported seeing an SUV similar to one registered to Garcia at that time and a person of similar build near the Hunter home, the affidavit said.

Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said on Monday that Garcia "fit the elements of a serial killer" and police had evidence he had been in Nebraska at the time of the murders, though he had not lived in Omaha since 2001.

VIDEO CHAT

The affidavit released on Thursday offered some links that could place Garcia near the vicinity of the Brumback house around the time that couple was thought to have been killed.

The couple had last been heard from on the afternoon of May 12 when they chatted by web video with their daughter, the affidavit said. They were found dead two days later in the same clothes they had worn during the Mother's Day chat.

About an hour before the chat, Garcia made a credit card charge and could be seen on video at a convenience store in Iowa, about 30 minutes from their house, the affidavit said.

Garcia's credit card was also used that afternoon at an Omaha restaurant about four miles from the Brumback house, it said.

His cell phone received a call that evening in Atlantic, Iowa, about an hour east of Omaha, and Garcia checked into a motel in West Des Moines less than two hours later, the affidavit said.

It also said Garcia had purchased a Smith &amp; Wesson 9mm semiautomatic handgun in March that was consistent with a magazine and two recoil springs police later recovered from the Brumback house in May.

According to the affidavit and records obtained by Reuters, Garcia had applied for Indiana medical licenses in 2008 and in 2012. Records released by the Indiana medical board from those applications show he failed to complete residencies in New York, Illinois and Louisiana in addition to Nebraska.

He was suspended from a New York residency for yelling at a radiology technician, then withdrew from the program in 1999. He also withdrew from an Illinois residency because of migraine headaches and was "essentially fired" from a residency in Louisiana, where he was refused a state medical license.

Garcia's application for a Louisiana medical license was rejected in February 2008, two weeks before Hunter and Sherman were killed, in part because he had not completed the other residency programs.



headline: Florida lawmakers want overhaul of 'Stand Your Ground' law
byline: By Tom Brown
8:31am EDT

defense law or enact sweeping changes to avert more tragedies like the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, Democratic leaders of the state's legislature said on Thursday.

A Seminole County jury on Saturday acquitted George Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter, with one juror citing Stand Your Ground as a factor in reaching her legal conclusion that Zimmerman acted in self-defense.

The Zimmerman verdict demonstrated the ramifications of the 2005 law, Florida Senate Democratic leader Chris Smith said.

"This bill actually encourages people to shoot their way out of situations and that's not how we live in a civilized society," Smith told a news conference. "It's a mentality that has permeated the state of Florida. It's a mentality of shoot first, and we should not have that in a civilized society."

Smith spoke with Florida House Democratic leader Perry Thurston. Both called for a special session of the state's Republican-dominated legislature to overhaul the law or consider doing away with it.

Unless Florida lawmakers act quickly, calls for a boycott of the state like the one voiced by Motown legend Stevie Wonder are likely to grow as part of a mounting backlash, they warned. With the state legislature in recess, Governor Rick Scott would need to convene a special legislative session.

Dozens of young demonstrators have been occupying part of Scott's office in the Florida capital, Tallahassee, since Tuesday to press demands that he order the state's lawmakers back to work to toss out or modify the law. The Tea Party-backed governor has been traveling and has not yet visited his executive office so far this week.

Smith and other lawmakers tried to get the Stand Your Ground law changed in the past legislative session in Tallahassee but failed to get a committee hearing on the issue.

After the Martin shooting Scott appointed a task force to examine the statute. The force held seven hearings around the state before recommending to keep the law despite many calls for it to be repealed, or amended.

Smith and Thurston said a ballot initiative was likely if the legislature failed to change the law, voicing confidence that public outrage over the verdict would help generate enough signatures to place the matter on the ballot.

According to the instructions given to the jury, Zimmerman had "no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force" if he reasonably feared for his life or great bodily harm.

Though the Stand Your Ground law was not specifically cited as part of the defense mounted by Zimmerman's lawyers, Smith said the jury instructions that helped pave the way for his acquittal came directly from the Stand Your Ground statute.

Smith and Thurston were joined at their news conference by Broward County State Attorney Michael Satz, who said he and other law enforcement officials supported calls for an urgent overhaul of the Stand Your Ground law.

"I think putting in the statute that you do not have the duty to retreat is a mistake. I think life is precious and before you do that you should do everything in your power not to do that and to retreat if you possibly can," Satz said.

"Before there was a common law duty that you had to retreat before you used deadly force," he added. "I just don't think you need the Stand Your Ground statute."

The statute was adopted under former Republican Governor Jeb Bush and many other states, acting with broad support from the National Rifle Association, have followed Florida's lead over the last seven years.



headline: Why many abortion clinics in Texas may stay open despite new law
byline: By Lisa Maria Garza
8:31am EDT

at least if history is any guide.

Governor Rick Perry signed the new legislation on Thursday, capping a whirlwind month in which Texas became the center of a national campaign by anti-abortion activists to restrict when, by whom and where the procedure can be performed.

Included in the new Texas law are requirements that abortion clinics meet hospital-style health standards, ranging from installation of hands-free sinks to upgrades to ventilation systems. Supporters call the rules crucial safety standards.

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposed them, saying that they are "unnecessary and unsupported by scientific evidence."

The new laws in Texas and elsewhere have alarmed abortion rights advocates, who see them as an attempt to thwart the right to abortion granted by the Supreme Court in 1973.

In Texas, Planned Parenthood announced on Thursday that it was closing one of its 13 abortion clinics that provide abortions, citing the new law. The nation's largest abortion provider said the rules could force all but a handful of the 42 abortion facilities in Texas to close down.

But similar warnings in other states have not come to pass.

Twenty-six states have laws that require abortion clinics to meet varying levels of hospital standards, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Pennsylvania, Virginia and Missouri passed strict health and safety rules similar to Texas, it said.

In those three states, however, most clinics were able to stay open after the laws passed, some by reallocating dollars to comply with building upgrades, according to abortion providers and state health department officials interviewed by Reuters.

"It seems like an exaggeration from the other side that access is going to be cut off," said Mallory Quigley, spokeswoman for the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony list.

Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, which favors abortion rights but does research cited by both sides, said the new law will have an impact in Texas but maybe less than the worst fears.

"Clinics will close," she said. "But I can't say we are going to go down to six."

Of the 24 clinics in Pennsylvania prior to a tough new law in 2011, one closed voluntarily, according to the state health department. The state closed two others for serious violations including a freezer lined with frozen blood, and stained surgical instruments in dirty drawers, according to reports by state inspectors.

Two others were consolidated into a third clinic but maintained the same level of service to women as before, said Dr. W. Allen Hogge, chair of the Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences Department at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

All of the remaining 19 clinics are in compliance, said Pennsylvania health department spokeswoman Aimee Tysarczyk.

"To be honest, we weren't counting numbers as far as how many were going to close," said Micaiah Bilger, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation, an anti-abortion group. "The purpose of the bill was to ensure basic health and safety standards for women that are going into these centers."

COMPLY OR CLOSE?

To remain open, some Pennsylvania clinics invested thousands of dollars to upgrade their facilities. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, for instance, said it spent about $400,000 to renovate two clinics after the state began implementing tougher standards in June 2012.

They installed hands-free sinks, new flooring and upgrades to heating, ventilation and air conditioning, said spokeswoman Maggie Groff.

"They had to spend large sums of money to comply that otherwise would have been put into patient care," Susan Frietsche, senior staff attorney at the Women's Law Project.

Only one clinic has closed in Virginia since a new law was implemented there earlier this year, the state health department said. No clinics have closed in Missouri because of a tough law passed there in 2007, abortion provider Planned Parenthood of Kansas and mid-Missouri said.

The national campaign to push for tighter restrictions on clinics gained momentum after the May conviction of a Philadelphia doctor, Kermit Gosnell, of murdering three babies born alive during abortions by severing their spinal cords.

Prosecutors in the case described his clinic as a "house of horrors" where recovery chairs were bloodstained and equipment broken.

The Gosnell case, Quigley said, shows "the abortion industry is not capable of policing itself."

Abortion rights activists said Gosnell was an exception among mostly safe and legal abortion providers.

In addition to the tough standards for clinics, the Texas law bans most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, requires doctors performing abortions to have hospital admitting privileges, and limits the use of the RU-486 drug to end pregnancies.

It requires all abortion facilities to meet the standards of "ambulatory surgical centers" that perform outpatient surgery. First trimester abortions, which account for most such procedures, rarely require surgery.

"What is frustrating to us, as physicians, are rules coming out in Texas and other states that are catching on like crazy but are not medically based. They are to shut down abortion facilities," said Dr. Anne Davis, consulting medical director with Physicians for Reproductive Health, a national organization of doctors supporting the right to abortion.

Planned Parenthood said on Thursday it was preparing to sue the state of Texas over the new law, a tactic they employed in Missouri when the state in 2007 passed legislation requiring clinics to meet outpatient surgery standards for most abortions.

The two sides reached a settlement in 2010 under which Missouri waived some rules for clinics that only performed first trimester abortions, thus avoiding closings, said Peter Brownlie, chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri.

headline: Mountain fire in southern California forces 6,000 to flee
byline: By Steve Gorman
8:31am EDT

A wildfire that chased some 6,000 people from homes, vacation cabins and campgrounds in the mountains of Southern California roared through dry brush and timber for a fourth day on Thursday as crews battled to keep flames away from popular resort areas.

The blaze erupted on Monday afternoon about 100 miles east of Los Angeles in the scenic but rugged San Jacinto Mountains overlooking Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and several smaller low-lying desert towns.

No injuries have been reported, but authorities say seven mountain residences, including three mobile homes, have been destroyed, along with five commercial structures, about a dozen outbuildings and several vehicles.

Authorities on Wednesday ordered the evacuation of the mile-high resort area of Idyllwild, along with the adjacent village of Fern Valley and all the parks and campgrounds in the vicinity as the blaze burned largely unchecked.

Several smaller communities in the area had already been evacuated during the first three days of the fire.

The latest evacuation notices brought to roughly 6,000 the total number of residents, vacationers and campers displaced by the so-called Mountain Fire, said Steve Gut, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service.

Gut said the blaze was moving in different directions but that flames were still several miles from the outskirts of Idyllwild, a popular mountain getaway known for its hiking, rock climbing, horseback riding and music scene.

Fire incident commander Jeanne Pincha-Telley told a news conference in Idyllwild that one flank of the blaze had reached to within 2 miles of the extreme southern edge of Palm Springs at the foot of the mountain. Palm Springs itself was not under evacuation.

Pincha-Telley said the towering column of smoke and cinders pouring skyward from the blaze might complicate efforts to contain the flames as hot embers carried aloft could ignite new spot fires in the area.

In the next two days, she said, that column is "predicted to go right over the top of this town."

By early Thursday, the fire had charred some 2,800 acres of drought-parched chaparral and timber, much of it in steep, remote wilderness terrain inside the San Bernardino National Forest.

That was more than three times the acreage reported burned two days earlier.

With nearly 3,000 firefighters, 17 water-dropping helicopters and 10 air tankers assigned to it, the blaze ranked as one of the most severe of more than a dozen large wildfires that crews were battling to contain in several western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.

Experts say this year could see one of the worst U.S. fire seasons on record. In recent weeks, a Colorado wildfire ranked as that state's most destructive on record ravaged more than 500 homes and killed two people. In Arizona, 19 members of an elite "hotshots" crew died while battling a separate fire on June 30.

In California, as of Thursday morning, firefighters had managed to carve containment lines around 15 percent of the Mountain Fire's perimeter. The cause of the blaze remained under investigation, authorities said.

headline: Judge in U.S. WikiLeaks case declines to dismiss charge of aiding enemy
byline: By Medina Roshan
8:31am EDT

martial of the U.S. soldier accused of the biggest leak of classified material in the nation's history refused on Thursday to dismiss the most severe charge the defendant faces, aiding the enemy.

That is one of 21 counts that U.S. Army Private First Class Bradley Manning is charged with, but it carries the possibility of life in prison.

"He was knowingly providing intelligence to the enemy," said Judge Colonel Denise Lind in rejecting a motion by Manning's lawyer to dismiss that charge.

Lind said military intelligence analysts such as Manning were trained to assume that anything posted on the Internet could be accessed by the enemy.

Manning, 25, is charged with sharing more than 700,000 classified files, combat videos and State Department cables with the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks while serving as a low-level intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010.

The case stands as a test of the limits of secrecy in the Internet era. Manning's lawyers have sought to portray him as naive but well-meaning, intending to provoke debate by providing Americans with more information about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

He acted through the WikiLeaks site, founded by activist Julian Assange, who has drawn the anger of the U.S. government, which charged that the leaks put national security and intelligence operatives at risk.

More than three years after Manning's arrest in May 2010, the U.S. intelligence community is reeling again from leaked secrets, this time exposed by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.

Snowden has been holed up in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, seeking a country to offer him asylum.

NEGLIGENCE, NOT ILL INTENT

Defense lawyer David Coombs earlier this week had argued that Manning was guilty of negligence but not the "general evil intent" standard required to justify the heavy charge.

Coombs also argued that the government was overreaching by charging his client with stealing information from a government database.

"The government is trying to say that the word database encapsulates everything under the sun," Coombs said. "Words matter."

Over the course of the trial, defense lawyers have sought to show that the slightly built Manning was naive but well-intentioned in seeking to inform Americans about the reality of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The trial will also hear from prosecution witnesses in a rebuttal phase following the close of the defense phase last week.

A top U.S. defense official told a security forum in Aspen, Colorado, on Thursday that the government is overhauling the way it stores information to prevent leaks similar to those orchestrated by Snowden or Manning.

Snowden has provided documents about secret U.S. and British eavesdropping programs to Britain's Guardian newspaper, the German magazine Der Spiegel and the Washington Post. He also made allegations about U.S. eavesdropping on Chinese targets to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.



headline: Developer can't recover World Trade Center damages from airlines
byline: By Bernard Vaughan
8:31am EDT

Developer Larry Silverstein cannot recover billions of dollars from airlines over the September 11, 2011, destruction of the World Trade Center in New York because insurers have already compensated his company, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said Silverstein's company has recovered more than $4 billion from its insurers.

Silverstein, 82, had sought to pursue damages at a trial from United Airlines and American Airlines, whose planes crashed into the World Trade Center.

"If this case were to go forward," Hellerstein said to a packed courtroom, Silverstein "would not be able to recover anything against the airlines."

Silverstein's World Trade Center Properties was seeking to recover as much as $3.5 billion from the airlines, including United Airlines, now United Continental Holdings Inc, and American Airlines and its parent, AMR Corp, which he accused of negligence in the attacks.

"We did not believe that the plaintiff could be permitted any further compensation and we are pleased the judge ruled in our favor," Christen David, a spokeswoman for United, said after the ruling.

We are gratified by the judge's decision," said American Airlines spokesman Mike Trevino.

Hellerstein's ruling concluded a four-day trial in federal court in New York that tasked him with deciding, without a jury, if Silverstein's insurance recoveries precluded him from seeking damages from the airlines.

"My holding is that they do," Hellerstein said Thursday.

Rich Williamson, a lawyer representing Silverstein's company, said after the hearing that the company planned to appeal the decision to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

"We will not rest until we have exhausted every option to assure that the aviation industry's insurers pay their fair share toward the complete rebuilding of the World Trade Center," Silverstein said in a later statement.

Hellerstein, a Bronx native who has presided over a several cases related to the attacks, commended Silverstein for his efforts to rebuild the World Trade Center.

"I look upon this as an American story, rising out of the ashes of destruction," he said of the rebuilding effort.

In January, Hellerstein will hear a trial pitting Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost 658 employees in the attacks, against American Airlines. The financial services firm sued the airline over lost business and the destruction of its offices in the World Trade Center.

The cases are World Trade Center Properties LLC, et al. v. United Airlines Inc; World Trade Center Properties LLC, et al. V. American Airlines Inc, et al, v. American Airlines Inc et all, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, Nos. 08-3719 and 08-3722.



headline: Sexual battery charge against U.S. Air Force officer changed
byline: By Tabassum Zakaria
8:31am EDT

A charge of sexual battery against a U.S. Air Force officer, in a case that became a symbol of the problem of military sex crimes, was dropped on Thursday and the prosecutor instead will pursue a charge of assault and battery.

Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Krusinski was chief of the Air Force sexual assault prevention and response branch when he was arrested in May and accused of groping a woman in a parking lot near the Pentagon.

"After a closer investigation of the facts and a review of the status of the case law, the more appropriate charge is the assault and battery, not the sexual battery charge," Theo Stamos, the prosecutor, told Reuters. She declined to comment about the evidence in the case.

The case was highly embarrassing for the Pentagon and came in the same week that it reported unwanted sexual contact complaints involving military personnel jumped 37 percent last year.

Krusinski's attorney, Barry Coburn, said the initial charge of a sex offense was the reason why the case made headlines, and he praised the prosecution for exercising "care and judgment" in dropping the sexual battery charge.

"Charging decisions such as this one must be based on the facts and the law of each individual case, not on politics or the desire to have a 'teachable moment' concerning issues such as sexual abuse in the military," Coburn said.

Krusinski, who was at the court proceeding, did not make any comment to reporters. After he was accused of sexual battery he was moved to another military personnel job.

Both the old and the new charges are misdemeanors and carry the same penalties of up to 12 months in jail and/or a fine of up to $2,500.

The prosecution expects to present the case to a grand jury on August 19 and if, as expected, an indictment is returned, a trial date would be set in Arlington Circuit Court, lawyers said.

The Air Force would not comment on the latest development in the case because it is being handled in civilian court.

Separately, the Air Force said on Thursday that airmen who commit sexual assault will be discharged from the service as part of new initiatives to combat the problem. The decision went into effect on July 2, the Air Force said.



headline: U.S. sees lower-than-expected Obamacare insurance costs
byline: By David Morgan
8:31am EDT

Hoping to gain the high ground in an escalating war of words over Obamacare, the U.S. administration on Thursday forecast sharply lower than expected insurance costs for consumers and small businesses in new online state healthcare exchanges.

The exchanges represent the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and their success could depend on the cost of so-called "silver plans" with mid-range premiums, which are expected to attract the largest number of enrollees.

A report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said data from 10 states and the District of Columbia shows preliminary 2014 premiums on the lowest-cost mid-range silver plans in those marketplaces to be 18 percent lower on average than earlier administration and congressional estimates.

Rates for businesses with fewer than 50 employees that purchase small-group coverage through exchanges could also be 18 percent lower than what the same plans would cost without the healthcare reform law, based on data from six states, HHS said.

The report was released in conjunction with a speech by Obama on how healthcare reform is already benefiting consumers. [ID:nL1N0FO0ZY] It represents the administration's latest bid to counter Republican allegations that consumers and businesses will see sharply higher costs from the exchanges than the individual insurance plans already on the market.

The new exchanges are slated to begin enrolling as many as 7 million uninsured Americans for 2014 on October 1 in federally subsidized health plans ranging in quality from platinum, with the highest premiums, to bronze, with the lowest.

"Today's report shows that the Affordable Care Act is working to increase transparency and competition among health insurance plans and drive premiums down," Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement accompanying the report.

The actual rates consumers see could be lower than current estimates, the HHS report concluded, saying that rate reviews and negotiations under way in the District of Columbia, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have already reduced prospective costs announced in the spring.

It was not clear whether the lower rates contained in the report would be reflected nationwide. The report's authors cautioned that some states could see costs closer to earlier projections.

RATE SHOCK, OR RELIEF?

Speculation about Obamacare's ultimate effect on health insurance costs has led to a rankling debate between opponents who warn of a coming "rate shock" for consumers and healthcare reform advocates who have become increasingly confident as states have released data suggesting no disaster.

Republicans in Congress responded to the new HHS forecasts by reiterating longstanding predictions of crippling upward spikes in insurance premiums and other costs when compared to health plans available on the market today.

"If the administration is concerned with saving people money on their healthcare, I have some advice for them. Work with us to repeal Obamacare and start over," said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.

Independent experts saw the HHS report as fresh evidence of a trend. "From what I'm seeing, rates are coming out lower than were anticipated when people started to talk them about a couple of years ago -- that is fact," said Dave Axene, a fellow at the Society of Actuaries.

He cited several reasons including a reinsurance program covering medical claims, the entry of low-cost insurers that specialize in Medicaid plans and Obamacare's requirement that insurers undergo rate reviews for proposed premium hikes of 10 percent or more.

But experts also noted that the HHS report focused on the lowest-cost silver plans, while some silver plan premiums reported by states have been significantly higher.

HHS compared state-reported rates with its own cost estimate for 2014, which it derived from a forecast for 2016 from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). In March 2012, CBO projected that a typical family would pay $15,400 a year for the second-lowest costing silver plan in 2016. HHS translated that number into an average 2014 monthly individual premium of $392.

Monthly premiums for the cheapest silver plans in the 10 states ranged from a low of $226 in New Mexico to $400 in Vermont. The second-lowest costing silver plans, seen by some analysts as a better guide to market costs, are 10 percent less expensive than expected, with individual premiums ranging from $280 in Oregon to $412 in Rhode Island and $440 in Vermont.

The 10 states examined in the HHS report are California, Colorado, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. Ohio and Virginia will have federally operated markets similar to those the administration is building in 32 other states. The remainder will run their own exchanges.

The HHS report said prospective premiums in the 10 states studied appear to be affordable for younger adults, including men. In Los Angeles, which has the largest number of uninsured people in the country, HHS said the lowest-cost silver plan for a 25-year-old individual will cost $174 per month without subsidies and $34 per month for an individual whose income is $17,235. A catastrophic plan, which mainly covers major medical costs, will cost $117 per month for an individual.



headline: Texas governor signs strict abortion law that sparked protests
byline: By Karen Brooks
8:31am EDT

Texas Governor Rick Perry on Thursday signed into law tough new restrictions on abortion, including a ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy, marking one of the biggest victories in a decade for opponents of the procedure in the United States.

Perry, a Republican, signed the measure flanked by invited political supporters and anti-abortion activists, who gave him a standing ovation as he entered the room.

"It is a very happy and celebratory day," said Perry, who thanked anti-abortion activists for helping to "support the health of Texas women."

Outside, about two dozen protesters dressed in black shouted "Shame," and "The blood of Texas women is on your hands!"

Republican lawmaker Jodie Laubenberg, who sponsored the bill, said "the hand of God" had allowed her and others to overcome fierce opposition and pass the measure in the Texas legislature.

Cherie Weaver, wearing a black dress to protest the law, said democracy had failed Texas women. "The separation of church and state has been completely undermined in this fight," she said, referring to the U.S. tradition of keeping government and religion at arms length.

The Roman Catholic church officially opposes abortion as do many conservative Protestants.

Texas Republicans, who have a large majority in the state legislature, pushed through the restrictions over the fierce objection of Democrats and supporters of the right to abortion.

Democratic state Senator Wendy Davis briefly caught national attention last month by staging a filibuster to stall the restrictions, although her gambit ultimately failed.

"When Governor Perry signed the bill, he signaled a clear break with Texas families," Davis said in a statement, adding that Perry was siding with "special interests" over women's health.

Supporters of abortion rights have vowed to challenge the law in court.

"We believe parts of this law are unconstitutional and are working to stop it from taking effect," Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a post on twitter. Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider.

Several other conservative states have approved piecemeal abortion restrictions, but Texas is by far the most populous and politically important, and it took more dramatic action by combining several measures into one bill.

The Texas measures are also more far reaching than a ban passed by the U.S. Congress in 2003 on a type of late-term abortion called "partial birth," which covered only a small fraction of abortions performed each year.

Texas joined 12 other states that have passed bans on abortion after 20 weeks, citing disputed research that a fetus feels pain by that stage. North Dakota and Arkansas have gone further, banning abortion as early as six and 12 weeks, respectively.

The current limit for abortions in Texas is 26 weeks.

Texas is also requiring all abortion facilities to meet by September 2014 the same standards as outpatient surgery centers, and forcing doctors performing abortions to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of a clinic.

The law will prohibit anyone other than a doctor dispensing the so-called "abortion pill," or RU-486 drug, to end pregnancies, and require that a second dosage be administered at a clinic under a doctor's supervision and not at home.

Texas already has a law passed two years ago requiring a woman to undergo an ultrasound and be shown the results, before an abortion can be performed.

Opponents of the new Texas law say it will be found unconstitutional because the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision in 1973 allowed abortion up to the point a fetus is viable, or can live outside the womb.

Supporters of the Texas law say technology for treating premature babies has resulted in survival at earlier stages of gestation. They say that the government has a compelling right to protect the fetus as early as 20 weeks.

The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives last month passed a ban on abortion after 20 weeks, although the measure has little chance of passage in the Democratic majority Senate.

Planned Parenthood and other operators of clinics have warned that only a handful of the 42 facilities in Texas providing abortions now meet the standards set in the new law, and the cost of upgrading could force dozens to close. Supporters of the law have said that is an exaggeration.

Within hours of Perry signing the law, Planned Parenthood said it would close one of its 13 centers providing abortions in Texas because of the new requirements.

Some legal challenges of other state laws have been successful. A federal judge on Wednesday extended for two more weeks a hold on a Wisconsin provision requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital, while the judge studies whether to block the law.

The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled recently on an abortion case. In 2006 it narrowly endorsed, 5 to 4, the U.S. Congressional ban on "partial birth" abortions.



headline: Brother of country star Randy Travis busted on meth charges

The younger brother of country music superstar Randy Travis was hit with more charges on Thursday stemming from his arrest earlier in the week on suspicion of making and distributing methamphetamine from his home in North Carolina, authorities said.

David Brownlow Traywick, 50, was charged with possessing methamphetamine precursors, storing controlled substances and possessing drug paraphernalia. Those charges followed felony trafficking and conspiracy charges earlier in the week after police found a small manufacturing operation in his Marshville home during a search on Tuesday evening, said Captain Ronnie Whitaker of the Union County Sheriff's Office.

"It was more like a one-pot meth lab, like something some of these folks do in cars driving down the road," Whitaker said. "But it's still dangerous."

Officers were investigating a tip that Traywick, who was already facing a separate methamphetamine charge at the time of his arrest on Tuesday, was cooking meth in the home, Whitaker said.

Marshville, where the six Traywick children were raised, including singer Travis, is about an hour southeast of Charlotte, N.C.

Traywick's wife, Jessica, and two other women were arrested on similar charges on Tuesday evening, Whitaker said.

The arrests come as Travis recovers in a Plano, Texas, hospital from brain surgery following a stroke and life-threatening heart condition.

Traywick's attorney could not be reached for immediate comment.

Drug trafficking charges in North Carolina carry minimum mandatory sentences. Depending on the amount allegedly being trafficked, sentences for meth trafficking could be anywhere from three to 18 years.

Traywick and his wife remained in jail on Thursday in lieu of $500,000 bond each.

Travis, 54, who has won numerous Grammy Awards and Country Music Awards, is no stranger to his own substance-related legal issues.

Earlier this year, the singer pleaded guilty and received probation on a drunken driving arrest that stemmed from a 2012 incident in which he crashed his car into a construction zone.

campus system.

Several students were forcibly removed from a meeting room at the University of California at San Francisco as the Board of Regents approved Napolitano to head the sprawling UC system at a salary of $570,000 per year.

The demonstrators, angry over Napolitano's immigration policies as Homeland Security chief, shouted "undocumented is not a crime!" as they were handcuffed by campus police and led from the room, briefly halting the hearing.

Some two dozen people had yelled "Shame! Shame! Shame!" during a public comment portion of the meeting. Others gathered outside to protest against Napolitano's approval of immigration issues and her lack of experience in education.

Napolitano becomes the first woman president in the 145-year history of the University of California, which has long been regarded as one of the top U.S. public university systems but which has been battered by nearly two decades of boom-and-bust funding, leading to tuition increases and classroom shortages.

"We all feel extremely excited about this as she brings fresh eyes to the UC system," Regent Sherry Lansing said before the vote. "She's had a lifetime of public service ... I think education is actually in her DNA."

Napolitano, a former two-term Arizona governor and Democrat, has been a lightning rod in the Obama administration for criticism by conservatives, who have accused her most recently of being soft on border control and immigration issues.

Latino leaders, meanwhile, have blasted Napolitano over immigration sweeps that led to large-scale detention and deportations involving undocumented immigrants.

"Janet Napolitano isn't qualified at all to be UC president, her background is in law and immigration enforcement. It worries me as an undocumented student to have a UC President who has put terror into my family," said demonstrator Rosa Hernandez, a 21-year-old student at the University of California at Berkeley.

Napolitano has acknowledged she was not a typical candidate and said she would meet with faculty, students, politicians and others to learn about the system.

"Whether preparing to govern a state or to lead an agency as critical and complex as Homeland Security, I have found the best way to start is simply to listen," said Napolitano, a lawyer by training.



headline: Texas governor signs strict abortion law that sparked protests

Texas Governor Rick Perry on Thursday signed into law tough new restrictions on abortion, including a ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy, marking one of the biggest victories in a decade for opponents of the procedure in the United States.

Perry, a Republican, signed the measure flanked by invited political supporters and anti-abortion activists, who gave him a standing ovation as he entered the room.

"It is a very happy and celebratory day," said Perry, who thanked anti-abortion activists for helping to "support the health of Texas women."

Outside, about two dozen protesters dressed in black shouted "Shame," and "The blood of Texas women is on your hands!"

Republican lawmaker Jodie Laubenberg, who sponsored the bill, said "the hand of God" allowed her and others to overcome fierce opposition and pass the measure in the Texas legislature.

Cherie Weaver, wearing a black dress to protest the law, said democracy had failed Texas women. "The separation of church and state has been completely undermined in this fight," she said, referring to the U.S. tradition of keeping government and religion at arms length.

The Roman Catholic church officially opposes abortion as do many conservative Protestants.

headline: Senators reach deal to move student loans to market rates

based rate.

Lawmakers are trying to secure a retroactive fix before the next educational year starts, after interest rates on millions of new federal student loans automatically doubled to 6.8 percent on July 1.

Unless Congress agrees on a fix, about 7.4 million students with federal Stafford loans will be affected and could end up paying up to $4,000 more in interest rates for a four-year degree program.

The deal, which followed extensive negotiations on Wednesday, would retroactively move the loans for the coming school year to a market-based rate that would roughly work out to 3.86 percent this year for undergraduates.

Congress currently sets the level of federal student loan interest rates, and critics of the system say it unfairly subjects students to political whims.

"It is refreshing that on such an important issue we stopped playing politics with our students' future to come up with a bipartisan, permanent fix that lowers interest rates for all students," said Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

The deal would tie interest rates on undergraduate subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans to the 10-year Treasury note plus 2.05 percentage points, and plus 3.6 percentage points for graduate loans.

It would cap rates at 8.25 percent for undergraduates, 9.5 percent for graduate students, and 10.5 percent for PLUS loans for parents who borrow to pay for their children's college.

A senior administration official said Obama supports compromise legislation that would hold down interest rates and was involved in the Senate negotiations.

A Democratic official said the measure would not raise money by charging students higher rates and would protect students from future rate rises. Democrats insisted they would not back any plan that uses student loans to fund the budget deficit.

Lawmakers haggled for months over student loan rates but failed to reach a deal before the rates doubled on July 1.

"This compromise is a win-win for both students and taxpayers," said Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. "Tying interest rates to the market allows students to take advantage of historically low rates while ensuring taxpayers will not have to foot the bill for arbitrary rates set by Congress."

Critics of market-based interest rate plans say they would help students immediately, but put them at risk of paying higher interest in the future as the economy improves and rates rise.

Such concerns are compounded by the recent jump in Treasury yields after the Federal Reserve announced that it planned to start scaling back its stimulus program that has kept interest rates low.

It is not clear whether the House of Representatives would move swiftly to approve an agreement like the one reached by the senators, but it passed a similar one in May.

House Speaker John Boehner said he had not yet seen the details of the Senate deal. "But it clearly follows the structure of the House bills. When we see the details, I am hopeful that we'll be able to put this issue behind us."

The Senate is expected to vote on the deal by next week.

headline: Obama steps in to push health plan as critical date draws near
byline: By Mark Felsenthal
8:31am EDT

Fending off delays and a barrage of political criticism of his signature healthcare law, President Barack Obama on Thursday touted benefits Americans already are reaping from the law and vowed to work through setbacks to fully implement it.

"Generally speaking, what we've seen is that healthcare costs have slowed drastically in a lot of areas since we passed the Affordable Care Act," Obama said at a White House event, surrounded by individuals who have seen their health insurance costs drop.

"I recognize that there are a lot of folks, in this town at least, who are rooting for this law to fail," the president said. "What I've heard is just the same old song and dance. We're just going to blow through that stuff," he added.

The president took to the soapbox just weeks after having to delay a requirement for businesses to offer health coverage in 2014, or pay a fine, because the administration had yet to issue final regulations in time for employers to comply.

Days after that July 2 announcement, the administration said it would delay and loosen requirements for new state online insurance marketplaces to verify the income and health coverage status of people who apply for subsidized coverage.

Congressional Republicans, who have repeatedly sought to repeal the health law, pounced on those delays and urged Obama to also put off requirements that individuals obtain health insurance.

Republicans are set to make the healthcare law a top campaign issue in next year's congressional elections, and the Republican-led House of Representatives on Wednesday approved largely symbolic legislation to delay portions of the law.

Senator Marco Rubio, considered a potential Republican candidate for president in 2016, on Thursday urged lawmakers to withdraw funding for it.

"The reason this issue is still being talked about is because Obamacare is a disaster," Rubio said.

Administration officials have struggled with the task of launching the new online health insurance exchanges at the heart of the law, sometimes called Obamacare, by an October 1 deadline.

Their efforts to implement the law have been hampered by limited staff and financial resources, as well as by steady opposition from congressional Republicans.

At the White House, the president said the law, formally called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was responsible for sending refund checks to some 8.5 million people as a result of lower insurance costs.

REBATES

U.S. insurers will pay $500 million in rebates to employers and individuals because the law requires companies to pay refunds to customers if they spend less than 80 percent of the premiums they collect on medical care, the administration said last month. That will mean an average rebate of $100 per family for about 8.5 million insurance customers, the government said.

The president also cited lower-than-expected insurance rates in New York and other states as evidence the law is trimming costs.

New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Tuesday that residents were likely to see their health insurance premiums cut in half as the law draws people into health insurance markets. California said in May that rates would fall as much as 29 percent.

Administration officials also pointed to a Department of Health and Human Services report concluding that cheaper insurance rates are likely to be the norm rather than the exception in 11 states.

The HHS report says the costs of plans will be lower than originally anticipated. For example, in the 11 states covered in the study, a mid-range plan in the individual market in 2014 is on average 18 percent less expensive than previous government and congressional estimates, the administration said.

Similarly, the report showed that the cost of the least expensive mid-level plan available to small employers in six states studied by the government is expected to be 18 percent lower than they would have paid for a similar plan before the law was enacted.

Some of the rate forecasts may be lowered before the exchanges are opened in the fall, the administration said.

Obama is hoping to use the positive developments to build support for a critical component of the law: getting healthy young adults to register for health insurance plans to counterbalance older, sicker enrollees and hold down costs.

Administration officials hope to sign up 7 million people nationwide during an enrollment period that begins on October 1 and runs until the end of March. They say they are focusing on an estimated 2.7 million healthy adults ages 18 to 35.

But in their stream of criticism of the law, Republicans say it will actually raise the costs of healthcare for all Americans, trigger an avalanche of new regulatory burdens on businesses, and inhibit hiring.

The delays have given Republicans ammunition to argue that the law was a bad idea in the first place.

"The law is turning out to be a train wreck," House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement in response to Obama's speech. "The law is costing American jobs; it's forcing people to give up health plans they like; and it's driving up the cost of care for families across America."



headline: Extortion victim of mob boss 'Whitey' Bulger found dead
byline: By Richard Valdmanis and Scott Malone
8:31am EDT

The dead body of a potential witness, who had hoped to testify about how mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger forced him at gunpoint to sell a liquor store, was found in a suburb of Boston, authorities said on Thursday.

Stephen Rakes, who once sued the FBI for failing to protect him from one of Bulger's extortion schemes, was found on Wednesday afternoon in Lincoln, Massachusetts, about 16 miles northwest of Boston, according to the Middlesex Country District Attorney's office.

There were no obvious signs of trauma, and the medical examiner is conducting an autopsy to determine the cause of death, the district attorney's office said. No wallet was found on Rakes' body, an attorney for Rakes' ex-wife told reporters.

While authorities investigated his death, prosecutors at the courthouse in Boston called on their major witness, longtime Bulger lieutenant Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi, to testify about the murders he says he and Bulger carried out.

Rakes, 59, was among the many extortion victims of Bulger's feared "Winter Hill" gang who were due to take the witness stand in the mob boss's trial. Authorities charge Bulger with committing or ordering 19 murders in the 1970s and 1980s.

Rakes, nicknamed "Stippo," once owned Stippo's Liquor Mart in South Boston, which prosecutors charge Bulger's gang took over in a 1984 shakedown. He was on the government's list of witnesses but had not yet taken the stand.

His ex-wife, Julie Dammers Rakes, learned of his death on Thursday morning and reacted with "surprise and shock," said her attorney, Anthony Cardinale.

Cardinale told reporters at Boston's waterfront courthouse that he did not believe Rakes' death was linked to the trial.

"I seriously doubt that this has anything to do with any part of the case," he said.

Bulger's gang bought the store for about $65,000 cash, forcing Rakes to take that sum at gunpoint in his home in front of his toddlers, prosecutors charge. They said the gang used the store as a front to launder money from illegal activities.

Like the gangsters, Rakes grew up in working class South Boston. After years of complaining about Bulger and his associates, Rakes had attended the trial almost every day and hoped to testify against the mob boss.

In 2002 Rakes sued the U.S. government for failing to protect him from Bulger's gang, which operated with impunity in Boston due to Bulger's relationship with the FBI. A federal judge dismissed the suit.

Bulger, 83, faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted of charges related to the 19 murders including racketeering, extortion and drug dealing.

He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, though his lawyer admitted that Bulger was a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark, essentially an "organized criminal."

Steve Davis, a friend of Rakes and a brother of one of Bulger's alleged murder victims, said Rakes did not feel at any time during the trial that his life was in danger. "He was comforted knowing Bulger was already behind bars," he told reporters outside the courtroom.

"STRICTLY CRIMINAL"

News of Rakes' death came the day prosecutors called one of the government's top witnesses, Flemmi, who is serving a life sentence for his role in many of the murders of which Bulger is accused.

As Flemmi was brought in to testify, he and Bulger saw each other for the first time since the week before Christmas in 1994. He told the court he had met with Bulger almost daily for two decades starting in 1974, and that their relationship was "strictly criminal."

Flemmi, who testified only briefly before court wrapped up for the day, said he and Bulger had met with a corrupt FBI agent "hundreds of times" to trade information.

Bulger has adamantly denied being an FBI informant, insisting that he paid then-agent John Connolly for tips but offered none of his own. Connolly is serving a 40-year prison sentence on racketeering and murder convictions.

The trial brings back a dark period for Boston's FBI office, when Bulger and Flemmi were listed as informants but also were given tips by corrupt agents who helped them escape capture and root out "rats" within their ranks.

Bulger fled in 1994 after a tip from a corrupt FBI agent that arrest was imminent. He was finally captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011 after 16 years on the lam.

His story inspired the 2006 Academy Award-winning film "The Departed," in which Jack Nicholson played a character loosely based on Bulger.

In 2004, Flemmi pleaded guilty to 10 murders in a deal that spared him the death penalty, and his testimony is expected to form the backbone of the government's case against Bulger.

In six weeks of testimony, witnesses so far have described Bulger as a cold-blooded criminal quick to violence. Former associates have accused him of participating in killing several people suspected of talking to law enforcement. Others said he used fear to extort cash.

The government is close to finishing its case and earlier this week advised U.S. District Judge Denise Casper that it could wrap up by Tuesday.



headline: Canada's big railways review safety rules after train disaster
byline: By Solarina Ho and Julie Gordon
8:31am EDT

Canada's two big railroads are reviewing safety standards after the deadly train crash on July 6 that killed some 50 people and destroyed the center of a small Quebec town.

Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, Canada's No. 2 operator, said on Thursday it has already made some changes to its operating rules. It will no longer park unattended trains hauling hazardous materials on main lines, and is bringing in tougher rules on setting the brakes that hold a stationary train in place.

The runaway train that smashed into the town of Lac-Megantic, Quebec, had been parked on a main line after the engineer, its only crew member, finished his shift.

The train, operated by the Montreal Maine &amp; Atlantic Railway (MMA), rolled down the track, gained speed, and derailed in the center of the lakeside town, with some of the 72 oil tanker cars it was hauling exploding into a wall of fire.

Investigators say the way in which the train's crucial hand brakes were set is one focus of their probe.

"The recent situation gave us a chance to thoroughly review our safety procedures, as we do on an ongoing basis," CP Rail spokesman Ed Greenberg said in a statement.

"We have now strengthened our operating procedures in some key areas that were identified from what recently occurred."

Canadian National Railway Co, the country's biggest railroad, has also started reviewing its policy for securing trains to strengthen its safety protocols, spokesman Mark Hallman said. It expects to complete the review shortly.

CLASS ACTION

The use of the hand brakes when the engineer parked his train for the night a few miles outside Lac-Megantic is also a crucial point in a class action suit being pursued by residents of the town of about 6,000 people.

The crash was North America's deadliest rail accident in more than 20 years.

The suit's preliminary document, filed in a Quebec court earlier this week, alleges that MMA and its affiliates cut costs to the point where safety was compromised, including replacing two-men crews with a single train operator, cutting wages and not ensuring company policy and regulations were followed.

The suit was updated late on Wednesday to also name Irving Oil Ltd, whose Saint John, New Brunswick, refinery was the destination of the crude oil shipment, and World Fuel Services Inc, which supplied the crude. It alleges the two companies failed to take appropriate measures to ensure that the crude oil was properly and safely transported.

Neither company responded to requests to comment, and MMA has also not commented on the suit.

"It was a highly flammable type of oil," said Jeff Orenstein of Consumer Law Group, one of the firms behind the class action suit. "They did not arrange for proper transport of the oil knowing the containers were insufficient for the purposes of this flammable oil."

The case, No.450-06-000001-135, was filed in the District of Saint-Franรงois in Sherbrooke, to the east of Montreal, because the courthouse in Lac-Megantic is in an off-limits zone where investigators are still searching for bodies and evidence.

"We couldn't get into the building, so we filed in Sherbrooke," said Orenstein, adding the legal team will request a transfer as soon as the Lac-Megantic court reopens.

Separately, Canada's Transportation Safety Board said two wheels of a freight car operated by MMA came off the rails on Thursday near Farnham, east of Montreal.

No one was injured and no cargo spilled from the train, which was not on the main track, a safety board spokesman said.



headline: Son of ex-Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky seeks name change
byline: By Dave Warner

Matt Sandusky, the adopted son of former Penn State assistant football coach and convicted child sex abuser Jerry Sandusky, wants a new name.

Matt Sandusky, 33, has filed for a name change, a spokeswoman for the court clerk's office in Centre County, Pennsylvania, said on Thursday.

The new name he wanted to be known by was not made public. Though the clerk's office would reveal Sandusky wanted to change his name, the file was sealed and unavailable to the public, the spokeswoman said. A judge was expected to set a hearing date on the motion.

Jerry Sandusky is serving a state prison sentence of 30 to 60 years on his conviction for 45 counts of sexual abuse of children.

His case rocked the world of college football, and led to the firing of renowned Penn State University Head Coach Joe Paterno, as well as the then-president of the university, Graham Spanier.

Matt Sandusky, then known as Matt Heichel, was taken into foster care in 1996 and subsequently was adopted by Jerry Sandusky and his wife, Dottie.

In June 2011, about the same time as Jerry Sandusky's trial, Matt Sandusky said through his lawyer that he, too, had been a molestation victim of Jerry Sandusky.



headline: U.S. overhauling intelligence access in bid to prevent another Snowden

leak like the one carried out by former spy agency contractor Edward Snowden, a top Pentagon official said on Thursday.

Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told a security forum that the government was already moving to better isolate intelligence so that all of it isn't accessible in one place, and to implement a "two-man rule" - similar to procedures used to safeguard nuclear weapons.

"When are we taking countermeasures? ... The answer is now," Carter told the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. "This failure originated from two practices that we need to reverse."

U.S. intelligence agencies conducting a forensic review of the activities of Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, are close to pinning down the extent of the classified documents he accessed and the means by which he removed materials from a secure environment, according to intelligence and security officials close to the investigation.

Carter declined to delve into details, saying the assessment was still ongoing. But he added: "I can just tell you right now the damage was very substantial."

Snowden has provided documents about secret U.S. and British eavesdropping programs to Britain's Guardian newspaper, the German magazine Der Spiegel and the Washington Post. He also made allegations about U.S. eavesdropping on Chinese targets to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.

The 30-year-old American who has had his U.S. passport revoked, is stuck in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport and has applied for temporary asylum in Russia.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said last month that U.S. officials advised her that Snowden had roughly 200 classified documents.

However, American officials and others familiar with Snowden's activities say they believe that at a minimum, he acquired tens of thousands of documents.

Current and former U.S. officials say that while authorities now think they know which documents Snowden accessed, they are not yet sure of all that he downloaded. Snowden was adept at going into areas and then covering his tracks, which posed a challenge in trying to determine exactly what materials he had accessed, officials said.

Carter partly blamed the emphasis placed on intelligence sharing in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, which allowed someone like Snowden to access so many documents at once.

"We normally compartmentalize information for a very good reason, so one person can't compromise a lot," Carter said. "Loading everything onto one server ... It's something we can't do. Because it creates too much information in one place."

He told reporters that the efforts to create more barriers to accessing information were under way, as were efforts to create a two-man rule for some operations.

Asked where the two-man rule was being put into effect, Carter said: "Everywhere where there are system administrators who had elevated type access, those procedures are (being adopted)."

Former and current U.S. officials told Reuters that a massive overhaul of the security measures governing such intelligence would be extremely expensive.



headline: Senate approves Perez as new labor secretary
byline: By Rachelle Younglai
8:31am EDT

The Senate on Thursday confirmed Thomas Perez as the Obama administration's new labor secretary, despite deep opposition from Republicans who accused him of bending the laws to advance a liberal agenda.

Senators voted 54-46 along party lines to confirm Perez, who is currently assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil rights division and has long experience working on immigration and civil rights issues.

President Barack Obama nominated Perez on March 18 to replace Hilda Solis, who resigned. Republicans have been holding up a vote on Perez for months.

As labor secretary, the 51-year old Perez will oversee the country's labor laws and employment benefits as well as the collection of jobs data.

Perez will be the only Latino to serve in Obama's second-term Cabinet so far and is expected to play an important role in the administration's push to rewrite immigration laws and give millions of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.

Hispanic groups threw their weight behind Perez, who briefly worked as a garbage collector and whose parents immigrated from the Dominican Republic. Many of the groups have been urging the administration to consider more Hispanics for high-level positions.

"We believe that the administration's leadership should reflect the diversity of the country," said Rafael Collazo, director of political campaigns for the Hispanic advocacy group National Council of La Raza.

The group praised Perez for his "unwavering commitment" to civil rights and said millions of Hispanics have benefited from his work.

Republicans had tried to block Perez's nomination, saying he was too political and aggressive on immigration issues.

After Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid threatened to stop Republicans from using procedural moves to block the president's choices for executive branch jobs, they eventually allowed the Senate to proceed with his confirmation and other nominees.

On Wednesday, six Republicans helped Democrats reach the 60 votes required to advance Perez's nomination. But on Thursday, those Republicans, along with the other 40 Senate Republicans, voted against Perez. The confirmation only required 51 votes.

"Tom Perez is more than just some left-wing ideologue. He's a left-wing ideologue who appears perfectly willing to bend the rules to achieve his ends," Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said before voting against Perez.

Republicans say Perez persuaded the city of St. Paul, Minnesota to withdraw a Fair Housing Act case from the U.S. Supreme Court in exchange for the Justice Department backing off from a separate legal claim against the city.

Perez denies the allegations.

The Senate this week also confirmed Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and backed Fred Hochberg for a second term as president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

Later on Thursday, the chamber is expected to move toward approving Gina McCarthy as the new Environmental Protection Agency administrator.

campus system.

Napolitano's nomination to head the sprawling UC system, long regarded as one of the top U.S. public universities, was announced last Friday by a 10-member special search committee as she revealed she was leaving President Barack Obama's cabinet.

If approved as anticipated by the Board of Regents, she would become the 20th president in the 145-year history of the university, which has been battered by nearly two decades of boom-and-bust funding, leading to tuition increases and classroom shortages.

The financial crunch has strained university relations with faculty and staff who have been hit with furloughs and hiring freezes.

The appointment of Napolitano, a career politician who has never held an academic post, has generated controversy.

Republicans have long criticized the former two-term Arizona governor, a Democrat, most recently saying she was soft on border control and immigration issues. Latino leaders, meanwhile, have blasted Napolitano over immigration sweeps that led to large-scale detention and deportations involving undocumented immigrants.

Some opposition to her UC hiring was expected to surface Thursday afternoon, when the regents were due to hold a public session in San Francisco to discuss the appointment.

A vote was scheduled after the session, and a university spokeswoman said the Napolitano would speak publicly about the job at that time.

Last Friday, she announced she would resign as secretary of Homeland Security, pending the regents' decision.

Napolitano has acknowledged she is not a typical candidate and said she would meet with faculty, students, politicians and others to learn about the system.

"Whether preparing to govern a state or to lead an agency as critical and complex as Homeland Security, I have found the best way to start is simply to listen," said Napolitano, a lawyer by training.

She was credited with championing the cause of public education during her gubernatorial tenure and protecting funding for the state's universities, even as she faced a $1 billion budget deficit upon assuming office.

Departing UC President Mark Yudof, also a lawyer, was chancellor of the University of Texas and president of the University of Minnesota before taking over at the University of California. He will step down on August 31 at the end of the academic year.

minded Republican and former deputy U.S. attorney general, as director of the FBI.

The nomination now goes to the full Senate, which is expected to confirm Comey as early as next week to replace Robert Mueller, who has led the bureau since shortly before the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.

All eight committee Republicans joined the panel's 10 Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate.

The committee's vote came two days after an agreement was reached to settle Democratic complaints that Republicans had unfairly delayed a number of other nominees.

Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, a committee member, brushed off the earlier showdown and praised Comey, saying, "When we get a good nominee, we move them."

Comey, 52, served as deputy U.S. attorney general for President George W. Bush, a Republican, from 2003 to 2005. He gained fame and a reputation for being willing to buck authority after refusing in 2004 to certify aspects of the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program.

At the time, Comey was acting attorney general while then-Attorney General John Ashcroft was hospitalized with pancreatitis.

Comey's refusal prompted top White House officials to go to the hospital and try to get Ashcroft to sign the certification. Comey, who was in the room, said Ashcroft refused.

Comey's actions won him the support of Democrats who opposed Bush's domestic surveillance program. Comey left the Justice Department in 2005 and served until 2010 as general counsel to aerospace giant Lockheed Martin.

At his Senate confirmation hearing this month, Comey testified that he believed that the use of waterboarding, or near drowning, as an interrogation technique was torture and thus illegal.

Comey said he had made his views known when he was in the Bush administration but lost battles to stop the CIA from using so-called enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding and sleep deprivation on enemy combatants.

"Mr. Comey has had an outstanding career in law enforcement, and if confirmed, I expect he will lead the Bureau with an independent voice," Senator Patrick Leahy, the committee chairman, said after the vote.

"Few positions have as much impact on our liberty and national security as the director of the FBI," Leahy said.

The FBI has nearly 36,000 employees, including 13,785 special agents who investigate cases ranging from domestic and international terrorism to civil rights violations, drug cases, white collar crime and public corruption.



headline: Man convicted of double murder may be second Texas execution this week
byline: By Karen Brooks
8:31am EDT

A man convicted of killing his girlfriend's sister and a university associate dean is scheduled to be executed on Thursday in Texas, marking a second execution in the state this week.

Vaughn Ross, 41, is set to die by lethal injection after 6 p.m. local time (CST) at a state prison in Huntsville, Texas.

The victims, Douglas Birdsall and Viola McVade, were found shot to death in January 2001 in Birdsall's car in a ravine in Lubbock, Texas, according to an account of the case from the state attorney general's office.

Birdsall, 53, and McVade, 18, had been shot several times and had died from gunshots to the head, the account said.

McVade was the sister of Ross's girlfriend, and Birdsall was an associate dean of libraries at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.

Ross, who held a college degree from a Missouri university and was putting himself through architecture classes at Texas Tech, was convicted and sentenced to death in September 2002.

He pleaded not guilty to the charges, with his lawyers arguing he could not have committed the crime alone and that police had planted evidence.

Ross told prosecutors that he had been fighting with McVade and had threatened her the night before her body was found, according to the attorney general's account.

McVade had repeatedly called her sister that night, and Ross also got on the phone. McVade put ex-boyfriends of her sister on the phone, one of whom called Ross a "coward," according to court filings. The girlfriend said Ross told McVade on the phone that if she showed up at his house, "I will shoot you," according to court filings.

After Ross gave police permission to search his house, investigators found a bloodstained sweatshirt with DNA from both Ross and Birdsall.

Inside Birdsall's car, a latex glove carried DNA that matched both men, and a large pool of blood in the alley behind Ross' apartment matched Birdsall's DNA. The car and bodies were found about four miles from Ross' home.

After his arrest, while he was in jail, Ross told his mother he "might have" committed the crime, the account said.

If Ross's conviction is carried out, he will be the 10th inmate executed in Texas and the 20th in the United States this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

On Tuesday, Texas executed John Manuel Quintanilla Jr. for the murder of a man during a robbery at a game room.



headline: Southern California wildfire forces evacuation of mountain resort
byline: By Steve Gorman
8:31am EDT

growing wildfire in the mountains of Southern California forced the evacuation on Wednesday of the popular resort community of Idyllwild after flames engulfed seven homes and numerous other buildings.

The blaze erupted on Monday afternoon about 100 miles east of Los Angeles in the scenic but rugged San Jacinto Mountains that overlook Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and several smaller desert towns.

By late Wednesday, the fire had charred more than 19,000 acres of drought-parched chaparral and timber, much of it in steep, remote wilderness terrain inside the San Bernardino National Forest, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Melody Lardner said.

That was more than double the acreage reported burned a day earlier by the so-called Mountain Fire.

"Inaccessibility is a big issue," Lardner told Reuters.

With nearly 3,000 firefighters, 17 water-dropping helicopters and 10 air tankers assigned to it, the blaze ranked as one of the most severe of some 16 large, wildfires that crews were battling to contain in several western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.

As of Wednesday evening, firefighters had managed to carve containment lines around 15 percent of its perimeter, Lardner said.

Roughly 100 homes in a handful of small communities near Idyllwild and Palm Springs were ordered evacuated during the first two days of the blaze and early on Wednesday.

Evacuation orders were expanded Wednesday evening to Idyllwild itself, along with part of the adjacent, smaller community of Fern Valley and all parks and campgrounds in the vicinity.

Authorities had no immediate estimate of the number of dwellings or individuals impacted by the latest evacuation notice. But Idyllwild, Fern Valley and the neighboring village of Pine Cove have a combined population of more than 3,800 people and nearly 1,700 households, according to the latest census.

No injuries have been reported, but authorities say seven residences, including three mobile homes, have been destroyed, along with one commercial structure, more than a dozen outbuildings and several vehicles.

Palestinian activism.

Sadia Saifuddin, a 21-year-old social welfare major at the prestigious University of California at Berkeley, will become the first Muslim student member of the 26-person board of regents for a year-long term starting in 2014.

Jewish groups including the prominent Simon Wiesenthal Center strongly objected to her nomination, citing her involvement in a campaign to divest university funds from companies with business connections to the Israeli military.

They also objected to her sponsoring a student senate resolution that condemned a lecturer at the system's Santa Cruz campus for what the resolution said was Islamophobic rhetoric. The groups said it was Saifuddin who showed an intolerance toward opposing viewpoints.

"In a year where campus climate issues have been the dominant theme of the UC system, a vote to appoint somebody who has served to polarize thousands and thousands of people in the campus community and beyond is shocking," said Rabbi Aron Hier of the Wiesenthal Center, which petitioned the regents to deny Saifuddin a seat on the board.

"An appropriate Muslim candidate could have ably served in this position. We don't believe Sadia is that appropriate candidate," he added.

Despite the opposition, 25 university regents voted on Wednesday to confirm her appointment with one member, Richard Blum, abstaining from the vote. He cited concerns about Saifuddin's divestment efforts.

"I'm beyond blessed, and I'm very excited for this position," Saifuddin said after the vote, wearing a floral Muslim headscarf and beaming as she walked through a largely supportive crowd to accept her seat.

In her acceptance speech, Saifuddin said she hoped to make the university system accessible to more students. She could not later be reached for comment on controversies surrounding her nomination.

Saifuddin's supporters said she was an exemplary student who cared about students of all faiths and has worked to benefit the system as a senator in the Association of Students of the University of California and a member of the Muslim Student Association.

"Sadia is a remarkable young woman. She is committed to supporting all of UC students, and to this university and this country which she loves," said Regent Bonnie Reiss, who chaired the student regent selection committee.

Reiss, who is Jewish, said the committee would not have selected Saifuddin to be a student regent if they thought she was anti-Semitic, responding to complaints that the divestment campaign included elements of anti-Semitism.

Council on American-Islamic Relations spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said opponents who disagreed with Saifuddin's politics wanted to unjustly exclude her from civic participation.

"Anytime an American Muslim rises to a prominent position, or starts to rise to prominence, that tiny minority of 'Islamophobes' in our society goes into action and seeks to marginalize and disenfranchise that individual," Hooper said.

defense law, which she said gave jurors no option but to acquit the defendant.

The juror's statement adds to pleas from around the country to change the "Stand Your Ground" laws that many states adopted after Florida did so under former Governor Jeb Bush in 2005.

Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson also urged authorities to toss out "Stand Your Ground" laws on Wednesday and highlighted what many see as racial bias in the U.S. justice system by drawing attention to the case of Marissa Alexander.

Alexander, a 32-year-old black woman, got a 20-year sentence for firing a bullet against a wall to scare off her abusive husband. The judge would not allow her to use a "Stand Your Ground" defense and it took the jury just 12 minutes to find her guilty of three counts of aggravated battery.

"In one case, Mr. Zimmerman kills a young man and walks away, free to kill again," Jackson told reporters soon after meeting Alexander in a Florida prison. "Marissa shot no one, hurt no one, and she's in jail for 20 years."

In the Florida capital, Tallahassee, demonstrators occupied a part of the governor's office for the second straight day on Wednesday demanding that the state repeal "Stand Your Ground."

With her identity kept secret, the juror, designated B-37, gave an interview to CNN on Monday that stirred further debate in the case that captivated the U.S. public and triggered lengthy discussions about race, guns and vigilantism.

After a torrent of criticism, including a statement from four other jurors who said she did not speak for them, the juror issued a statement further stressing her position that Florida's self-defense law forced the jury to vote not guilty.

"My prayers are with all those who have the influence and power to modify the laws that left me with no verdict option other than 'not guilty' in order to remain within the instructions," juror B-37 said. "No other family should be forced to endure what the Martin family has endured."

According to the instructions given to the jury, Zimmerman had "no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force" if he reasonably feared for his life or great bodily harm.

LAW CHALLENGED

Among the many voices demanding change, singer Stevie Wonder said he will not perform in Florida until the state discards a "stand your ground" law.

A day after U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder questioned those laws in a speech, the Florida president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) urged Republican Governor Rick Scott on Wednesday to return to Tallahassee to meet with the scores of young demonstrators occupying his office to protest the verdict.

The protesters, hastily organized by a group called "Dream Defenders," are among those demanding Scott call a special session of the Republican-led Florida legislature to repeal "Stand Your Ground."

"The consequence of this verdict and the 'Stand Your Ground' law has made Florida an increasingly unsafe state for its citizens, especially its black and Latino youth," Adora Obi Nweze, president of the Florida State Conference of the NAACP, wrote in a letter hand-delivered to Scott's office.

An aide said the governor was out of town.

After three weeks of testimony and 16 hours of deliberation, the jury of five white women and one of mixed race acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of Martin, inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford on February 26, 2012.

Shortly before the shooting, Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, called police from his car to report a suspicious person, Martin. The rapid-fire chain of events ended when Zimmerman shot Martin through the heart with his 9mm semiautomatic handgun.

The Democratic leaders of Florida's legislature, who are in the minority in both chambers, were due to hold a news conference in Fort Lauderdale on Thursday to announce plans for action in response to the Zimmerman acquittal. They tried to get the "Stand Your Ground" law changed in the past session, but couldn't manage to get a committee hearing on the issue.

Juror B-37, a mother of two who grew up in a military family and used to have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, said one holdout juror switched her vote to "not guilty" after half an hour of agonizing over the law.

"She wanted to find him guilty of something but couldn't because of the law. The way the law was written, he wasn't responsible for (negligent) things that he had done leading up to that point," she said.

paying bounties to anyone who shoots down an unmanned drone.

Next month, trustees of the town of 600 that lies on the high plains 55 miles east of Denver will debate an ordinance that would allow residents to purchase a $25 hunting license to shoot down "unmanned aerial vehicles."

Similar to the bounties governments once paid to hunters who killed animals that preyed on livestock, but only after they produced the ears, the town would pay $100 to anyone who can produce the fuselage and tail of a downed drone.

"Either the nose or tail may be damaged, but not both," the proposal notes.

The measure was crafted by resident Phillip Steel, a 48-year-old Army veteran with a master's degree in business administration, who acknowledges the whimsical nature of his proposal.

But the expansion of drones for commercial and government use is alarming, he said.

"We don't want to become a surveillance society," he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

He said he has not seen any drones, but that "some local ranchers" outside the town limits have seen them.

Under the proposal, hunters could legally shoot down a drone flying under 1,000 feet with a 12-gauge or smaller shotgun.

The town also would be required to establish a drone "recognition program" for shooters to properly identify the targeted aircraft.

"In no case shall a citizen engage an obviously manned aerial vehicle," the draft proposal reads.

Steel said that if the town trustees don't vote to adopt the ordinance, it will go before voters in a special election.

"Yes, it is tongue-in-cheek, but I'm going to vote for it," said Dorothy Pisel, one of the town's trustees. "It could benefit the town with all the publicity."

Steel acknowledges his idea is symbolic but he hopes it will curtail the use of drones over the 1.1-square mile burg.

"If you don't want your drone to go down, don't fly it in town," he said.

The Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately have a comment.



headline: Families of Newtown shooting victims to each receive $281,000 in donated funds

8:31am EDT

Families of 20 children and six adults killed in the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school each will receive $281,000 from the $11.4 million in donations, an oversight board said on Wednesday.

The Newtown Sandy Hook Foundation, which oversees the donations, also decided that the families of 12 children who witnessed and survived the attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December each will get $20,000 and two teachers who were injured will split $150,000.

Of the total $11.4 million in donations raised with the help of the United Way charity, $7.7 million was set aside for the victims of what was one of the worst mass school shootings in U.S. history. The remaining $3.7 million was dedicated to a long-term community fund, a decision by the foundation board that has been criticized by some victims' families and Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy.

"You really have to ask the foundation board why it decided not to distribute all the donated funds to the families," said Kenneth Feinberg, who advised the distribution committee and also oversaw compensation for victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and the Boston Marathon bombing.

Dr. Charles Herrick, chairman of the foundation board, pointed out "the board decided to distribute 95 percent of the funds directly to the families, but there are many, many victims - including 400 students at the school that day and all the first responders.

"We wanted to ensure there are some funds left for the future needs of people in the community who are going to need help," said Herrick, a Newtown resident and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry of the Western Connecticut Health Network, which oversees Danbury and New Milford Hospitals.

"This is a balancing act and there are other victims we have to think about too," he said. "This is a marathon, not a sprint and there's no way to know what problems will arise over the next 10 years."

In a letter to the board, Malloy insisted that an independent third party from outside of Newtown be chosen to oversee any remaining funds. Herrick said the board would press ahead with its plan to appoint another local distribution committee by mid-September to oversee the money.



headline: IRS workers involved in Tea Party scrutiny to face U.S. lawmakers
byline: By Kim Dixon
8:31am EDT

Internal Revenue Service officials who took part in added scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax exemptions will testify publicly for the first time on Thursday before U.S. lawmakers, in an affair that has become increasingly partisan.

The hearing comes two months into the controversy, set off in May when an inspector general's report said the IRS inappropriately targeted Tea Party and other conservative groups for added review of their applications for tax exemptions.

Republicans say the IRS actions were influenced by political officials in Washington.

Democratic and Republican congressional investigators for the House of Representatives' Oversight and Government Reform Committee have been probing the matter, conducting more than a dozen private interviews with IRS staff.

As they have gathered material on the controversy that cost the chief of the IRS his job and triggered an FBI inquiry, committee staff on both sides have leaked interview transcripts to the press to prove certain points.

Democrats say the interviews done so far show there was no political involvement in IRS activities and they released a 36-page memo on Tuesday excerpting interviews with 15 IRS employees, all of whom they say back up that view.

Republicans highlighted interview excerpts of their own on Wednesday, detailing the involvement of Washington-based IRS officials.

No one disputes that IRS handling of tax-exemption applications from non-profit groups was centered at a branch office in Cincinnati and that most of the singling out of certain groups for closer attention was done by mid-level staff.

The committee will hear testimony on Thursday from Elizabeth Hofacre, a front-line agency employee in Cincinnati, and Carter Hull, a Washington official involved in reviewing the cases.

Also testifying will be Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration Russell George and other TIGTA officials. That office has played a central role in the controversy, having issued a report in May sharply critical of the IRS.

The inspector general's office has come under fire from Democrats who say his report focused too narrowly on delays in the processing of conservative groups' applications, ignoring potential delays faced by groups linked to liberal causes.



headline: U.S. court awards custody of American Indian girl to adoptive parents
byline: By Harriet McLeod
8:31am EDT

cultural legal battle to be returned to her adoptive parents.

The order on the future of Veronica, 3, was greeted joyfully by her adoptive parents in South Carolina, who raised her from birth but were ordered 18 months ago by the same court to turn her over to her birth father because he is American Indian.

Veronica has been living with her birth father, Dusten Brown, in Oklahoma since 2011.

"We are thrilled that after 18 long months, our daughter finally will be coming home," adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco, who live in Charleston, said in a statement. "Our prayers have been answered."

The court's order on Wednesday instructs the state's family courts to finalize Veronica's adoption by the Capobiancos. It comes just weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court in June threw out the earlier decision to grant custody to Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation.

The decision brought harsh rebuke from the Cherokee Nation.

"Dusten Brown is a fit, loving parent and Veronica is, as the court previously defined, 'safe, loved, and cared for,'" Cherokee Nation said in a statement. "That should be enough."

Brown, who was not married to the birth mother, had argued that the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, intended to keep Native American children from being separated from their families, entitled him to have Veronica, who is 3/256th Cherokee.

He took custody at the end of 2011 when the girl was just over 2 years old, and South Carolina's highest court later upheld his custody.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Capobiancos. The Supreme Court threw out the South Carolina court decision awarding custody to the father and returned the case to the South Carolina state courts to sort out the adoption case.

Although adoption petitions have been filed by Brown and other family members in Oklahoma, the South Carolina court said on Wednesday that only the Capobiancos had filed for adoption in the correct jurisdiction and should get custody.

The couple had arranged with the girl's birth mother to adopt the girl before she was born and still maintain a relationship with the mother.

In its order, the court said it had erred in its 2011 judgment.

"There is absolutely no need to compound any suffering that Baby Girl (Veronica) may experience through continued litigation," wrote South Carolina Chief Justice Jean Toal.

But while the courts say the time has come for the tug-of-war to end, tribal lawyers say they'll continue the battle to let Brown keep custody of Veronica.

"We absolutely believe that it is in Veronica's best interest to stay with her father and we will do what we can to make sure that happens," said Chrissi Nimmo, assistant attorney general for the Cherokee Nation. "She not only has a father, she has a large family and pets and friends and a sibling."

defense case that he called a "travesty" of justice.

Jackson spent an hour in a jailhouse visit with Marissa Alexander, 32, an African American who was sentenced to a mandatory 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot into the wall of her home in 2010 to end a violent argument with her abusive husband.

"In one case Mr. Zimmerman kills a young man and walks away, free to kill again," Jackson said. "And Marissa shot no one, hurt no one, and she's in jail for 20 years."

Jackson said the contrast in the Zimmerman and Alexander cases exposed injustices in the justice system.

"We see radical racial polarization in the judicial system," Jackson told the Florida Times-Union. "That's a cause of great concern."

After meeting with Alexander, Jackson spoke with Angela Corey, the state prosecutor who handled both the Martin and the Alexander cases. Corey told him that Alexander's case is in the appeal phase and out of her jurisdiction, but Jackson said he asked her to use her power to see that Alexander is released.

"Ours was a moral appeal," he said. "This mother has three children. They need their mother," he said, noting that Alexander had already served the three years originally offered to her by the state in a plea deal.

Michael Dowd, a New York domestic violence attorney handling Alexander's appeal, contends she should not have been charged with felonies, but rather a misdemeanor, such as unlawful discharge of a gun.

Local leaders from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Action Network are calling for Florida Governor Rick Scott to pardon Alexander.

PROSECUTOR'S RECORD

When Scott appointed Corey special prosecutor in the Zimmerman case and she brought second-degree murder charges against him, some legal experts said she had overcharged. After her office lost the case, many legal experts said prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to win a second degree murder conviction.

When Corey first ran for office in 2008, the tough-on-crime Republican prosecutor promised voters she would pursue criminals to the fullest extent of the law.

Corey also garnered national condemnation when she charged 12-year-old Cristian Fernandez with first degree murder in the death of his two-year-old stepbrother. At the time, Fernandez faced mandatory life in prison if found guilty.

In the Alexander case, Cory charged the 32-year-old woman with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon because her husband's two children were in the house during the argument.

Alexander's case received little attention when she was convicted, but that changed after the Trayvon Martin killing cast a new spotlight on Florida's "Stand Your Ground" self-defense laws.

Under the "Stand Your Ground" law, people fearing for their lives can use deadly force without having to retreat from a confrontation, even when it is possible.

Alexander, a slightly built woman, said her husband, Rico Gray, was moving toward her threateningly when she fired into a kitchen wall. He had previously been convicted on a domestic violence charge for attacking her.

Gray's two children were at home, in the living room. Prosecutors alleged that the shot endangered Gray and the children.

Alexander filed a "Stand Your Ground" claim, but a judge ruled against her because Alexander chose to go back into the house with her gun.

A jury took just 12 minutes to find her guilty of three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Because Alexander fired a gun in the incident, Florida's "10-20-Life" mandatory-minimum sentencing guidelines required the judge to sentence her to 20 years in prison.

At the time, Alexander had an active restraining order against her husband and she carried a concealed weapons permit.

renowned artists, federal prosecutors said.

Glafira Rosales, 56, was charged with wire fraud, money laundering, filing false tax returns and failing to report assets from a foreign bank account, according to the indictment in Manhattan federal court. If convicted on all charges, she faces a maximum prison sentence of 59 years, prosecutors said.

Rosales, who was arrested on May 21, is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges on Friday. Her lawyer did not immediately return a call for comment Wednesday evening.

Prosecutors said in court filings that Rosales sold more than 60 allegedly never-before-seen works of art from some of the most renowned artists of the 20th century, including Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning. In fact, the paintings were fake, and Rosales knew it, prosecutors alleged.

Prosecutors said Rosales claimed to represent a Swiss client or a Spanish collector, neither of whom existed, but instead kept most proceeds and transferred large sums to her boyfriend at the time.

Rosales also hid her income from the sales and failed to report at least $12.5 million in income on her taxes between 2006 and 2008, the indictment said. She also allegedly failed to report to U.S. tax authorities assets in a foreign bank account in 2010 and 2011.

"The indictment depicts a complete circle of fraud perpetrated by Glafira Rosales - fake paintings sold on behalf of non-existent clients with money deposited in a hidden bank account," Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.



headline: U.S. aviation chief defends NextGen progress as funding cuts loom
byline: By Matt Haldane
8:31am EDT

The head of the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday defended the "NextGen" program to modernize U.S. flight control systems, telling a government panel the effort has made progress despite delays and is "designed to be flexible."

"Overall, NextGen is on track," FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a House of Representatives aviation subcommittee.

But an aviation industry group later responded that the expected cost and efficiency benefits from the program have so far not been widely realized.

The FAA's Next Generation Air Transportation System program was launched to switch flight control operations from radar to GPS-based technology, allowing more traffic and reducing flight delays. The program was set up to be implemented in stages between 2012 and 2025.

Huerta said the program has had some successes, noting the deployment of 500 satellite systems at ground stations. Specific airports have already seen increases in air traffic and millions of dollars in savings, he said.

"As of this very moment, air carriers that take advantage of precision routing get into and out of airports more quickly and efficiently, which reduces fuel use, saves money and decreases aircraft exhaust emissions," Huerta said in a prepared statement.

However, several members of the subcommittee said organizational troubles within the FAA were delaying NextGen.

"There are serious concerns regarding the FAA's ability to effectively and efficiently implement NextGen," said committee Chairman Frank LoBiondo.

Calvin Scovel, the inspector general with the Department of Transportation, said government budget cuts, known as sequestration, had already halted some projects to ease congestion at U.S. airports.

The FAA faces more cuts as well. Representative Rick Larsen noted that a proposed budget recently passed by the House Appropriations Committee is 22 percent less than requested and is the lowest capital funding since 2000.

"At those funding levels, the agency would be required to restrain (NextGen) efforts greatly," Scovel noted.

But Huerta said that while the proposed cuts may cause the latest programs under NextGen to be suspended and might cost up to 700,000 jobs by 2021, the program was "flexible" enough to adapt.

"The industry and we have agreed that it would be prudent for us to have a clear sense of ... priorities," he said.

The DOT's Scovel, however, said the technology had not been widely adopted and that delays and costs meant the program would cost "significantly more" than the planned $40 billion and could take 10 years longer than the original 2025 deadline.

"I would urge the committee to hold the FAA's feet to the fire," Scovel said, suggesting the inspector general's office could be used to ensure the FAA meets its goals.

Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, a trade organization that represents the commercial aviation industry, said in an email that the new procedures are not yet widely used.

In some cases, airlines have invested in equipping planes with GPS, but have not been able to take full advantage of the modern technology, she said, adding FAA data shows that flight delays cost airlines and consumers about $31 billion annually.

"To date, FAA has received adequate funding for NextGen," Medina said. "And it speaks to the fact that we need policies and procedures in place to enable us to use the equipment we have already invested in."



headline: House Republicans vote to delay Obamacare mandates

Republicans in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, approved largely symbolic legislation aimed at undermining President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law.

The measures, the 38th and 39th House bills to take aim at the 2010 reforms known as Obamacare, would delay for a year the requirement that Americans obtain health insurance and would codify the Obama administration's recent decision to delay the mandate for larger employers to offer health coverage.

The White House's surprise announcement of the one-year employer delay this month sparked a new wave of Republican anger over the healthcare law that threatens to bleed into other issues, such as government spending legislation, in the next fiscal year.

Obama administration officials have insisted that the law's core provision, the requirement for uninsured Americans to obtain subsidized coverage through new online exchanges, will remain in place. Those with no coverage will face tax penalties starting in January.

The House voted 264-161 for the individual delay, and 251-174 in favor of the employer delay, with some Democrats joining the Republican effort.



headline: Doctor accused of Nebraska revenge killings to be extradited

A doctor described by police as fitting a serial killer's profile said on Wednesday he would not fight extradition to Nebraska from Illinois to face charges of murdering four people, including one of doctors who fired him in 2001 for erratic behavior.

Dr. Anthony J. Garcia, 40, has been held without bond in a county jail in southern Illinois since his arrest on Monday.

Garcia was fired as a pathology resident at Creighton University in Omaha in 2001 by Dr. Roger Brumback and Dr. William Hunter for erratic behavior, Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said at a press conference on Monday.

He is accused of killing Brumback and his wife, Mary Brumback, both 65, in May. He is charged with killing Hunter's son, Thomas Hunter, 11, and Shirlee Sherman, 57, the Hunter family housekeeper, in 2008, though police have said they believe they were not the intended targets.

Schmaderer told a news conference on Monday that Garcia "fit the elements of a serial killer."

Police have released few details about the case, but documents from the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency, where Garcia had applied twice for medical licenses, show he failed to complete residencies in New York, Illinois and Louisiana in addition to Nebraska.

Attorneys representing Garcia told the Omaha World-Herald newspaper that Garcia wanted to move forward and get the chance to prove his innocence. Extradition from Union County, Illinois, back to Omaha could take up to two weeks.

Schmaderer said on Monday Garcia had not lived in Omaha since his firing in 2001 but police have evidence that suggested he had visited the state at the time of the killings.

Search warrants were also being served around the country by task-force members at places where Garcia may have worked, lived, or where someone had a connection with him, Schmaderer said.

The task force had been watching Garcia and had Illinois State Police stop him when he was on the move, Schmaderer said. He had a .45-caliber handgun and showed signs of being drunk when he was pulled over, Schmaderer said.

According to documents from the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency, Garcia joined the Bassett-St. Elizabeth Family Medicine Residency Program in New York in June 1999, but was suspended for yelling at a radiology technician and resigned in December 1999.

The New York State Board of Professional Medical Conduct gave Garcia an administrative warning for his conduct on July 25, 2001 and said his name would be flagged if he applied for a state medical license in the future.

Police plan to execute a search warrant at Garcia's home in Terre Haute, Indiana, on Tuesday, Schmaderer said. Search warrants were also being served around the country by task-force members at places where Garcia may have worked, lived, or where someone had a connection with him, he said.

Garcia started his Creighton residency in July 2000 and was fired in June 2001 because he had called another resident's wife while the man was taking a critical exam and told her that her husband must return to the pathology department for an emergency, according to a letter from Creighton to Garcia.

After Creighton, Garcia started and withdrew from a residency at the University of Illinois at Chicago because of migraine headaches, he said.

Garcia also said he was "essentially fired" from a psychiatry residency at LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, Louisiana, because he could not obtain a state medical license, according to the documents.

Louisiana's board of medical examiners rejected Garcia's application on February 27, 2008, just weeks before Hunter and Sherman were killed.



headline: Quebec brings in 9/11 expert to help sift through train crash debris

8:31am EDT

A U.S. expert who worked on the aftermath of the September 11 attacks is helping Canadian authorities sift through wreckage left more than a week after a runaway train barreled into a lakeside town in Quebec killing 50 people, police said on Wednesday.

Frank DePaolo, an emergency specialist from New York's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, visited the ruins of Lac-Megantic earlier in the week.

DePaolo is an expert in managing major disaster sites and is responsible for one of the forensic teams working at the collapsed World Trade Center towers in New York City.

"He said the efforts were complex and difficult and he was overwhelmed (by) the enormity of the situation," Quebec police spokesman Michel Forget told reporters.

A spokeswoman in DePaolo's New York office said he was not available for comment.

Investigators are painstakingly working their way through Lac-Megantic, where a runaway crude oil train derailed and exploded on July 6 leaving burned-down buildings, mountains of rail-related debris and charred trees. Some 37 bodies have been recovered and investigators are still searching for more remains.

It was North America's deadliest rail accident in more than 20 years.

The center of the town - in the mainly French-speaking province of Quebec - is considered a crime scene and it will likely be weeks to months before trains are able to run again.

Quebec police have said their investigation of the crash is still in its early stages, although they say they are looking at the possibility of criminal negligence.

Canada's new transportation minister, Lisa Raitt, met local officials in Lac-Megantic on Wednesday and said the federal government was ready to help the community. She gave no details.

Earlier on the day the railway company at the center of the disaster confirmed it had laid off a number of people in Maine and Quebec.

The cutbacks at the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway (MMA) come 11 days after a runaway train hauling 72 tanker cars of crude oil derailed and exploded in the center of Lac-Megantic, leveling the heart of the small town.

Megantic," Cathy Aldana, a vice president at Rail World Inc, the parent company of MMA, told Reuters. "The intent is to rehire the employees when the line is open again."

Aldana could not confirm how many employees were affected by the layoffs, but Canadian media outlets, citing union sources, reported that 19 people were laid off in Quebec alone.

A Quebec union representative was not immediately available for comment.

The disaster in Lac-Megantic has cut off local firms that use the railroad to ship their products to customers, including exports to Maine, just 18 miles away.



headline: U.S. vague on whether Obama will go to Moscow amid Snowden flap
byline: By Steve Holland
8:31am EDT

The White House is deliberately leaving it vague as to whether President Barack Obama will attend talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin if the saga involving former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden is unresolved.

Putin has invited Obama for face-to-face talks in Moscow ahead of a St. Petersburg summit in September with leaders of the G20 nations, and the White House announced on June 17 that Obama would both attend the summit and go to the Russian capital.

But that announcement was before Snowden fled to Moscow from Hong Kong on June 23 to avoid facing U.S. espionage charges for revealing details about secret U.S. surveillance programs involving phone and Internet data.

Snowden, stuck in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, has since applied for temporary asylum in Russia, putting Moscow further on the spot. The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Putin would not be the one making the decision.

Pressed on Wednesday on whether Obama will still go on the Moscow part of the trip, White House spokesman Jay Carney was vague.

"I have no further announcements on our travel to Russia. The president intends to go to Russia in September," he said.

An Obama decision not to go to attend talks with Putin would register his displeasure with the Russian leader's refusal thus far to expel Snowden back to the United States.

An administration official said the White House vagueness about the Obama Moscow visit "reinforces without being belligerent that this is an irritant."

Obama and Putin spoke by phone about Snowden last Friday. Administration officials say Obama's message was the same as that communicated by other U.S. officials at various levels to their Russian counterparts - that Russia has the legal basis to expel Snowden and should do so.

The Snowden affair has already prompted a U.S. lawmaker to suggest that Washington should consider boycotting the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics if Snowden is granted asylum in Russia.

"I love the Olympics, but I hate what the Russian government is doing throughout the world," Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told NBC on Tuesday. "If they give asylum to a person who I believe has committed treason against the United States, that's taking it to a new level."

Putin signaled on Wednesday that he did not want a dispute over Snowden to derail Russian relations with the United States.

The White House agreed.

"We share President Putin's views expressed again, that we don't want this matter to do harm to our bilateral relations," said Carney.



headline: Zimmerman jurors passed time with manicures, movies and bowling

week murder trial in Florida fended off cabin fever with manicures, movies and mall shopping.

Under the round-the-clock watch of the Seminole County Sheriff's Office, the sequestered jury of six women who listened to long days of testimony in the highly charged case blew off steam with an occasional side trip.

The jury found Zimmerman not guilty in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in a case that captivated the U.S. public and triggered lengthy discussions about race, guns and self-defense laws.

There was the all-day excursion to the historic town of St. Augustine, where jurors gawked inside Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum. They knocked down pins at a bowling alley, perused merchandise at the Daytona Beach mall and munched popcorn watching two court-approved movies: "World War Z" and "The Lone Ranger."

"I think people have to understand that you (sequestered jurors) are under 24-hour, seven-day-a-week jail. I don't know how else to describe it," said Maryanne Morse, the Seminole County Clerk of Courts whose office provides jurors for trials.

"At some point, to not be stir crazy and get on each other's nerves, you have to take them somewhere and give them some entertainment," Morse said.

The jurors stayed in private rooms at a 3-star Marriott hotel a short drive from the courthouse in Sanford, Florida.

The cost of sequestering them for 22 days, and for the four alternate jurors who spent a portion of that time incommunicado, totaled approximately $33,000, according to a tally revealed on Wednesday by the sheriff's office.

Taxpayers footed the bill, including $350 for side trips, although jurors were responsible for personal expenses, such as manicures, pedicures and haircuts. They received their $30-a-day jury pay in cash every week, Morse said.

Jury sequestration is rare but typically comes into play in high-profile trials awash in media coverage. Zimmerman jurors were allowed visits from family and friends on weekends, only after signing an agreement to not discuss the case or tell anyone about the visit.

Their hotel rooms were stripped of televisions, radios and all electronics and they were allowed their cell phones only once a day to retrieve voicemails and make phone calls in the presence of a sheriff's deputy, Morse said.



headline: Chicago toughens ban on assault weapons amid violence
byline: By Renita Young
8:31am EDT

The Chicago City Council voted unanimously on Wednesday to toughen its existing ban on assault weapons by adding more types of guns to the banned list and imposing stiffer fines for violations of the law.

The nation's third-largest city is facing a wave of gang-related gun violence. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago police have struggled to reverse the trend that has persisted even after they put more police on patrol in some neighborhoods.

While official statistics show Chicago's murder rate has subsided somewhat from last year, injuries and deaths are common from gun violence, particularly in predominantly African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods. Violence is usually higher during the summer when the weather is warmer.

Chicago acted quickly on gun control to beat a deadline set by the state of Illinois for local governments to set tougher gun laws before a state law allowing the carrying of concealed weapons goes into effect.

Gun control has been a hot issue in the United States since the massacre of 20 elementary school children in Connecticut last December. President Barack Obama proposed tougher gun laws but has so far failed to convince Congress to pass them.

Chicago's ban applies to a specific list of weapons with certain features. They include: any semiautomatic rifle or handgun that is capable of accepting a detachable magazine and has at least one military feature; any shotgun that is capable of accepting a detachable magazine, has at least one military feature, or has a fixed capacity of more than five rounds; and any weapon with a fixed magazine of more than 15 rounds.

Among the features defined as "military" are telescoping stocks, pistol grips, grenade launchers and barrel shrouds, according to the mayor's office.

"Weapons that are designed for the battlefield have no place on the streets of Chicago," Emanuel said.

The tougher laws would improve public safety, Emanuel said, but others questioned whether they will be effective.

"No legislation, no matter how strict, will keep weapons out of the wrong hands. We all know that," said Chicago City Councilman Robert Fioretti, who voted for the gun ban.

The state of Illinois does not have an assault weapons ban, nor do any of the states closest to Chicago: Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan. Chicago police have blamed an influx of guns from outside the city, and thus outside their jurisdiction.

The city council also approved stricter fines and punishment for gun crimes near schools and along so-called "safe passage" routes to schools.

Many parents of students attending Chicago public schools are concerned that a proposal to close 50 public schools this summer will force children to cross gang lines to attend new schools and will result in violence.

The new laws also would increase punishment for possession of weapons, such as knives, near schools.

led House of Representatives on Wednesday approved largely symbolic legislation to delay key coverage requirements.

The measures, the 38th and 39th House bills to take aim at the 2010 reforms known as Obamacare, would delay for a year the requirement that Americans obtain health insurance and would codify the Obama administration's recent decision to delay the mandate for larger employers to offer health coverage.

The White House's surprise announcement of the one-year employer delay this month sparked a new wave of Republican anger over the healthcare law that threatens to bleed into other issues, such as government spending legislation, in the next fiscal year.

Obama administration officials have insisted that the law's core provision, the requirement for uninsured Americans to obtain subsidized coverage through new online exchanges, will remain in place. Those with no coverage will face tax penalties starting in January.

The House voted 264-161 for the individual delay, and 251-174 in favor of the employer delay, with some Democrats joining the Republican effort.

VENTING FRUSTRATION

The legislation stopped well short of previous efforts to fully repeal Obamacare, but gave Republicans a new chance to vent their frustration at the law and discredit it as the state-run insurance exchanges prepare to open in October.

"The delay of the employer mandate is the latest confirmation of the fatally flawed nature of Obamacare and the need to dismantle it," said Rep. John Kline, a Republican from Minnesota. "It isn't right to deny American families the same relief available to American businesses."

While the legislation faces a White House veto threat and is virtually certain to blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate, Republicans insist they will keep trying to kill Obamacare and keep it alive as a 2014 campaign issue.

They argue that the law's mandates will drive up healthcare costs, stunt job growth and cause businesses to cut back employee working hours to avoid the coverage requirements.

Many Democrats derided the votes as another political sideshow consuming the House's time and energy. They pointed to new health insurance pricing information released by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday as evidence that the law will reduce coverage costs.

Cuomo's report showed that many New York state residents who buy health insurance next year will most likely see their premiums cut by half [ID:nL1N0FN186].

"What we're hearing right now is the sound of Republican heart rates going up: Obamacare is coming," said Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat from Washington state. "These last benefits are going to happen - like it or not - and worse, they're going to work."

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Republicans were simply trying "to refight old battles than have been fought."

He said Obama will give a speech on Thursday touting the healthcare law's benefits, including the 8.5 million consumers who are receiving an average $100 rebate this summer from insurance companies. The rebates are due to a provision in the law that requires companies to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on medical care, rather than on administrative costs.



headline: Officials warn of Obamacare insurance exchange delays
byline: By Patrick Temple-West and Kim Dixon
8:31am EDT

Two U.S. government officials warned on Wednesday that the launch of new state healthcare exchanges could potentially be delayed, raising further doubts about the implementation of President Barack Obama's signature legislation.

Alan Duncan, an auditor with the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, an Internal Revenue Service agency that monitors performance, said testing the systems needed to implement the exchanges "will be difficult to complete" by the October 1 start date.

"The lack of adequate testing could result in significant delays and errors in accepting and processing ... applications for health insurance coverage," he told the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform committee.

At the same hearing, Government Accountability Office official John Dicken said the amount of work the federal government needs to do in each state has yet to be determined, raising the risk of missing deadlines. He added that the federal government and the states have already missed some deadlines.

The House on Wednesday approved a one year delay to the law.

However, Obama administration officials offered assurances that they were on track.

"We are on target to have our new systems ready for deployment when open enrollment in the marketplace begins on October 1," Acting Internal Revenue Service chief Danny Werfel told the committee.

At a separate hearing, Mark Iwry, a health policy senior adviser at the Treasury Department, told lawmakers the administration's healthcare work was on time.

HEALTHCARE'S PATH AHEAD

Beginning in October, individuals will be able to buy health insurance through the new exchanges to comply with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which is also sometimes called Obamacare.

The exchanges are essential to the healthcare law's "individual mandate," which requires people to have insurance or pay a fine. The exchanges will extend coverage to millions of uninsured Americans by offering subsidized insurance through online marketplaces in all 50 states.

Many states have refused to set up the exchanges, adding to the federal government's burden in implementing the law, which begins for individuals next year. The federal government has to set up exchanges for individuals in 34 states.

The U.S. Treasury and White House said earlier this month that businesses would not be required to offer health coverage, or pay a fee, for 2014 to give businesses more time to comply.

Businesses complained that IRS instructions on how to comply were not published and they would not have time to prepare. The new fee affects businesses with more than 50 full-time employees.

Congressional Republicans, who have taken more than three dozen votes to repeal the law since it was signed in 2010, are using the delay to argue that the entire law is flawed.

Also on Wednesday, the Republican-controlled House Appropriations Committee approved a 24 percent budget cut for the IRS in fiscal 2014. The bill prohibits the agency from spending funds to implement the healthcare law's individual mandate.

Republican efforts to repeal or defund the law have little chance of passing in the Democratic-controlled Senate.



headline: U.S. Postal Service renews push for five-day mail delivery

class mail and to implement other overhauls needed to modify its outdated business model.

The Postal Service earlier this year pulled the plug on a plan to end delivery of first-class mail on Saturdays, bowing to pressure from lawmakers and industry groups to maintain a six-day schedule.

"The Postal Service continues to face systemic financial challenges because it has a business model that does not allow it to adapt to changes in the marketplace and it does not have the legal authority to make the fundamental changes that are necessary to achieve long-term financial stability," Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

The Postal Service's financial troubles largely stem from a 2006 congressional mandate to prefund up to 75 years of its future retirees' healthcare, and dwindling revenues as more Americans use Internet and email to communicate rather than buying stamps.

The mail carrier lost $16 billion last year.

Donahoe wants lawmakers to eliminate the retiree prefunding requirement and allow the Postal Service to control its own healthcare system. The mail carrier expects to default on its next $5.6 billion payment to the Treasury for the future retirees's healthcare fund due in September.

The semi-independent government agency relies on sales of stamps and other products rather than taxpayer dollars to fund its operations. Revenue from first-class mail, its most profitable service, decreased by $198 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013.

"We cannot pretend these marketplace changes aren't happening or that they don't require us to make fundamental changes to our business model." Donahoe said. "We need legislation that, together with our planned changes, confidently enables at least $20 billion in savings by 2016. If not, we go over the edge."

The Postal Service's pleas for flexibility have so far gained little traction as Congress has several times failed to pass legislation allowing it to modify its operations.

"Ultimately, we've kicked the can down the road, first in 2006 by not doing enough and every year since," said Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa of California, a supporter of a five-day mail delivery schedule.

"We in the House, we in the Senate must get together and we must do it this year," Issa said about a Postal Service overhaul.

But the Postal Service still faces a Congress that remains gridlocked on reform and preoccupied with other legislative priorities.

On Wednesday, Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the oversight committee, questioned Issa's push for five-day delivery.

Instead, Cummings has introduced a bill that would create a new position for a chief innovation officer to develop more competitive products for the Postal Service.

It would also permit the Postal Service to provide non-postal services, such as check-cashing, warehousing and logistics and public Internet access as alternative ways to raise revenues. Cummings' bill would also delay the next payment into the healthcare prefund until 2017.

"If we reject extreme measures that harm postal workers, increase the Postal Service's debt and destroy existing services, I believe we can identify common-sense provisions that provide common-ground solutions," Cummings said.
