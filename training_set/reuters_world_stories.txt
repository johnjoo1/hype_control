headline: Senate panel approves resolution on Syria military strikes

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a resolution on Wednesday authorizing limited U.S. military intervention in Syria, setting the stage for a debate in the full Senate next week on the use of force.

The committee voted 10-7 in favor of a compromise resolution that sets a 60-day limit on any engagement in Syria, with a possible 30-day extension, and bars the use of U.S. troops on the ground for combat operations.

The compromise is more limited than President Barack Obama's original proposal but would meet his administration's goal of punishing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government for what the United States says was the use of chemical weapons on Syrian civilians, killing more than 1,400 people.

The relatively close committee vote reflected the broad divisions on the authorization in Congress, where many lawmakers fear it could lead to a prolonged U.S. military involvement in Syria's civil war and spark an escalation of regional violence.

Five Republicans and two of Obama's fellow Democrats - Chris Murphy and Tom Udall - voted against the resolution. Democrat Ed Markey voted "present," saying in a statement that he is still undecided.

The full Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to vote on the resolution next week. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives also must approve it. The fate of the resolution in Congress is uncertain as scores of lawmakers in both parties have yet to stake out a public position other than to say they are looking for more answers.

Obama and administration officials have urged Congress to act quickly, saying U.S. national security and international credibility is at stake in the decision whether to use force in Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons.

"If we don't take a stand here today, I guarantee you, we are more likely to face far greater risks to our security and a far greater likelihood of conflict that demands our action in the future," Secretary of State John Kerry told the House Foreign Affairs Committee at a separate meeting on Wednesday.

"Assad will read our silence, our unwillingness to act, as a signal that he can use his weapons with impunity," Kerry said.

Anti-war protesters greeted Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, during their House committee appearance. Protesters held hands splattered with blood-red paint in the air behind Kerry as he spoke.

Murphy said he opposed the resolution because he was concerned a strike could make the situation worse in Syria and he feared the possibility of a prolonged U.S. commitment.

"I oppose it not because I don't gag every time that I look at those photos of young children who have been killed by Assad in his lethal attacks. It's simply because I have deep concerns about the limits of American power," Murphy said.

The committee vote came after the two committee leaders - Democratic Chairman Robert Menendez and senior Republican Bob Corker - crafted a compromise to meet concerns that Obama's proposed resolution was too open-ended.

Republican John McCain, a proponent of strong action in Syria, objected to the more narrow compromise. The committee adopted his amendments spelling out the policy goals of degrading Assad's ability to use chemical weapons and increasing the military capability of rebel forces.

'MOMENTUM ON THE BATTLEFIELD'

"These amendments are vital to ensuring that any U.S. military operations in Syria are part of a broader strategy to change the momentum on the battlefield in Syria," McCain said.

The committee rejected Udall's amendment to prohibit air and naval forces from entering Syrian waters or air space, and an amendment by Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky that would have reaffirmed Congress's role in declaring war.

Polls show strong public opposition to U.S. military involvement in Syria, and the debate in the U.S. Congress is unfolding one week after Britain's Parliament rejected British involvement in any military operation.

In Sweden, Obama issued a blunt challenge to U.S. lawmakers to authorize a military strike on Syria.

"My credibility is not on the line. The international community's credibility is on the line," Obama told a news conference in Stockholm. "And America and Congress's credibility is on the line, because (otherwise) we give lip service to the notion that these international norms are important."

Kerry told House lawmakers that at least 10 countries have pledged to participate in a military intervention in Syria, but did not identify them or specify what roles they would play.

Many members of Congress have said they are worried the resolution could lead to the deployment of U.S. ground troops, or "boots on the ground," in Syria - which administration officials said would not happen.

"It's very clear on the House side there is no support for boots on the ground," House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce told Kerry at the hearing.

Kerry answered flatly, "There will be no boots on the ground. The president has said it again and again."

Kerry had a sharp exchange with Republican congressman Jeff Duncan, who said the administration has a credibility problem after the deaths of American diplomats in Benghazi, Libya, last year. He accused Kerry of being too cautious.

"I volunteered to fight for my country and that wasn't a cautious thing to do," Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran, told Duncan.

"We don't deserve to drag this into yet another Benghazi discussion when the real issue here is whether or not the Congress is going to stand up for international norms with respect to dictators," Kerry said.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid is confident that a majority of the 100 members will vote yes, but is still unsure if he can get the 60 votes needed to overcome possible Republican procedural roadblocks, aides said.

In the 435-member House, a senior Republican aide predicted that most of the 50 or so Republicans backed by the conservative Tea Party movement will vote no. A number of Democratic liberals are also expected to vote against the resolution, placing the final outcome in doubt.

off had failed.

Hamma Hammami, a senior leader in a coalition of over a dozen secular opposition parties agitating for new elections, blamed the Islamist Ennahda party heading the government coalition for the collapse of two weeks of mediated talks.

The talks aimed to lead to new polls that analysts say the unpopular Ennahda would probably lose, ending Tunis's Islamist experiment without the violence seen in Egypt after the army overthrew Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Mursi in July.

"Ennahda is responsible for the failure of the negotiations because it has shown it does not want to leave power despite the crisis that has rocked the country," Hammami told journalists after a meeting with Hussein Abassi, head of the powerful UGTT trade union federation mediating the talks.

"The opposition will launch a major protest campaign from Saturday to force the government to step down", he added.

Tunisia, birthplace of the Arab Spring revolts, has been in crisis since late July after the second assassination this year of a secular politician by suspected Islamist radicals prompted the opposition to demand the government quit immediately.

The million-member UGTT, the only national organization with the muscle to push the parties to a compromise, has proposed the government step aside for a caretaker cabinet to hold new polls.

But Ennahda and its two small secular coalition partners said they would only be ready to step down after a month. It had earlier announced it wanted time for a commission to finish work on drafting a new constitution.

"The coalition does not accept the humiliation that the opposition seeks to impose through an immediate resignation," government spokesman Mouldi Riahi said.

The opposition coalition, called the Salvation Front, came together after the murder of the prominent secularist politician Mohamed Brahmi on July 25, six months after another leftist leader was gunned down.

The opposition led mass protests and the assembly writing the new constitution suspended its work, throwing the country into its worst political crisis since autocratic President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was overthrown in January 2011.

That revolution unleashed unrest across the Arab world, unseating rulers in Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and leading to a civil war in Syria.

Sri Lanka's government criticized the U.N.'s top human rights official on Wednesday for calling attention to accusations that police and soldiers had harassed people who met her during a visit to the country's former war zones.

Navi Pillay, ending a mission to assess Sri Lanka's progress after a 26-year war between the government and separatist Tamils, said on Saturday she had received reports that people she had met in the north and east during her seven-day trip were questioned and intimidated.

She said the U.N. viewed any reprisals against people who talked to its officials as an extremely serious matter and that such harassment "appears to be getting worse in Sri Lanka, which is a country where critical voices are quite often attacked or even permanently silenced".

Government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said Pillay should not comment on accusations from people who fail to produce evidence.

"If it has happened, it has to be reported to the police station. Then inquiries can be conducted," said Rambukwella, adding that the police had received no complaints.

"I have no evidence that she had inquired from authorities (about harassment)," he said. "She just said that because somebody has just told her."

Pillay - a South African of Indian Tamil origin - said people were still suffering four years after the end of the war and there were signs the country was becoming more authoritarian.

The government later said the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had acted beyond her mandate with the comments.

Her visit followed a U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution in March that urged Sri Lanka to carry out credible investigations into killings and disappearances during the war, especially during its final stages.

She visited the former northern war zones in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and the eastern district of Trincomalee, and met leaders in the capital, Colombo. The visit sparked demonstrations both supporting and opposing her mission.

New York-based Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday that Sri Lanka's government should promptly investigate the allegations that security forces harassed people who met with the U.N. human rights chief.

Rambukwella dismissed the demand, saying: "We don't take Human Rights Watch seriously at all as they are totally biased".

year election horizon, and the view is a lot better.

Abbott's conservative Liberal-National coalition appears to be a shoe-in at elections this weekend, ending six years of Labor rule, and all the talk has been of the challenges he faces.

Chief among those are worries about a substandard economy and the pressure it's putting on public coffers -- fears which have in large part been fanned by Abbott's coalition while in opposition. Indeed, the last recession was more than two decades ago and government debt is relatively low and manageable.

And any economic pain is likely to be concentrated in the near term, where blame can be conveniently laid at the feet of the former government.

It also helps that the starting point is not as bad as many feared. Government figures out this week showed the economy grew by 0.6 percent in the June quarter and a steady 2.6 percent for the year, defying speculation of a much deeper slowdown.

That is short of the 3.25 to 3.5 percent pace that Australians have come to think of as "normal", but the economy is still consistently faster than any other developed nation.

Most economists expect growth to stay around 2.5 percent for a few more quarters, but further out things are brighter.

For instance, Reuters' latest poll of global banks found they expected economic growth to quicken to 3.1 percent over next year.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is confident growth will accelerate to an above-average pace by 2015 -- its forecasts even stretch as high as 4.25 percent.

With another election not due until 2016, such an outcome would put Abbott in the driving seat to win a second term.

FORTUNATE TIMING

Developments offshore should also augur well for Abbott, with a marked improvement in economic news from the rich world in the past month or so.

The United States has gained enough traction that the Federal Reserve can consider reining back on stimulus, while Europe has emerged from recession.

Japan has boasted its best growth in years, and fears of a hard landing for China have faded in the face of better data on manufacturing and trade.

The latter is particularly good news for Australia as the Asian giant takes fully a third of its exports and is by far the biggest consumer of its iron ore, a A$60 billion-a-year boon to its trade accounts.

Indeed, figures out Thursday showed no slacking in demand for the ore. Australia's Port Hedland, which handles about a fifth of the global seaborne market for the steel-making material, reported shipments to China rose 9 percent in August, up a hefty 33 percent on the same month last year.

"Finally, all the evidence now points to a renaissance of growth in the advanced economies," said Scott Haslem, an economist at UBS.

He noted that while instability in some emerging markets, such as India and Brazil, had garnered a lot of headlines, those countries accounted for only 12 to 13 percent of global output.

In comparison, the economies that were stabilizing, which includes China, were four times larger at 55 percent of output.

"This suggests greater upside risks, than downside risks, to global growth from here."

Another timely blessing for Abbott has been the decline in the Australian dollar. For almost all of the last three years of Labor government it had been punishingly high, hollowing out manufacturing and crimping export earnings.

Since most of Australia's resource exports are priced in U.S. dollars, a high local currency lessens returns to miners, and so profits and tax receipts.

Fortunately for Abbott, then, that the currency has fallen by 14 percent since April, delivering a major windfall to miners and the next government's bottom line.

The RBA has made much of research that implies a 10 percent decline in the currency will stimulate economic growth by between 0.5 and 1 percentage point over two years.

"The Aussie is once again playing its traditional role as an income buffer," said Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

"The main beneficiaries of this income buffering should be corporate profits and government tax revenues related to that profit story."

NO AUSTERITY PLEASE, WE'RE AUSTRALIAN

Having spent the past three years excoriating the Labor government for running deficits and accusing it of taking debt to crisis levels, Abbott has since abandoned all pretence of trying to get into the black in his first term of office.

Net government debt is expected to peak at 13 percent of GDP in the year ending June 2015, and the budget deficit for the current fiscal year is forecast at $30 billion, equal to 1.9 percent of gross domestic product.

Abbott's earlier stance on the deficit had raised the prospect of a dose of European-style austerity, which is now widely seen as having needlessly deepened the recession in Europe and actually only added to government debt problems.

Such was the threat that it moved U.S. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz to write a warning piece for the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper this week.

"The political spotlight has fallen on the perceived problem of government debt, with alarming proposals to bring austerity 'down under'," Stiglitz wrote.

"Proposals for substantial budget cuts seem particularly misplaced at this time given that Australia's economy is confronting new global challenges."

Yet he needn't have worried, because a return to budget surpluses now sounds more of an aspiration than a target.

Instead, Abbott conjured up a 10-year timetable to reach a "believable surplus", a distant goal that would also require his party to win three elections in a row, and told ABC television he was aiming for relatively modest savings.

"I don't think anyone is going to think at the end of this week, 'My God, there is this massive fiscal squeeze coming.' If anything, what they will think is there has been a massive scare campaign," Abbott reassured viewers.



headline: U.S. resolution on Syria strike passes first hurdle in Senate
byline: By Patricia Zengerle and Khaled Yacoub Oweis
6:20pm EDT

U.S. President Barack Obama's effort to win legislative backing for military strikes against Syria passed its first hurdle on Wednesday when a Senate committee voted in favor, but the narrow margin of victory showed the depth of U.S. caution.

In a possible sign of internal unrest in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's ruling Alawite sect in the shadow of a likely U.S. intervention, Syrian opposition figures said General Ali Habib, a former defense minister, had defected. Syria denied the report.

Washington and Syria's main backer, Russia, remained publicly at odds as Obama tried to build his case for military action over chemical weapons before flying to Russia for a G20 summit hosted by President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.

Putin said U.S. congressional approval without a U.N. Security Council resolution would be an act of aggression, and accused U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry of lying by playing down the role of the militant group al Qaeda with rebel forces.

With Obama focused on building international support, administration officials kept up their campaign of persuasion in Congress, where deep U.S. skepticism about going to war was reflected in a House of Representatives hearing.

Still, after much jockeying over the exact wording, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a resolution authorizing the use of military force in Syria in a vote that avoided party lines, with Democrats and Republicans on both sides. The action cleared the way for a vote in the full Senate, likely next week.

The committee voted 10-7 in favor of a compromise resolution that sets a 60-day limit on any engagement in Syria, with a possible 30-day extension, and bars the use of U.S. troops on the ground for combat operations.

The administration is trying to balance the views of many in Congress who want a narrowly defined resolution against hawks such as Senator John McCain, who has pushed for a broader resolution that would allow direct U.S. support for rebels.

The Senate committee adopted amendments proposed by McCain with policy goals of degrading Assad's ability to use chemical weapons, increasing support for rebel forces and reversing battlefield momentum to create conditions for Assad's removal.

The authorization still faces significant resistance in Congress, where many lawmakers fear it could lead to a prolonged U.S. military involvement in Syria's civil war and spark an escalation of regional violence.

The full Senate is expected to vote on the resolution next week. The House of Representatives also must approve the measure.

RUSSIAN TENSIONS

Obama said he would continue to try to persuade Putin of the need for punitive strikes on Assad for using chemical weapons when the two meet in St. Petersburg.

In Stockholm en route to Russia, Obama said the credibility of America and of the world was at stake. He appeared to take umbrage at a reporter's question about the "red line" he set for Assad at an August 2012 White House news conference.

"I did not set a red line. The world set a red line," Obama said, referring to bans on chemical weapons use.

Putin again questioned Western evidence. He accused Kerry outright of lying when, in urging Congress to approve strikes on Syria, Kerry played down the role of al Qaeda in the rebel forces. "Al Qaeda units are the main military echelon, and they know this," Putin said.

"He is lying and knows he is lying. It's sad."

Earlier, Putin had said in a pre-summit interview with the Associated Press that he could not absolutely "rule out" Russia supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution to punish Assad - if it could be proved he had used poison gas.

Briefing members of Congress in Washington, Kerry said those comments were "hopeful" and "there may be a road forward where Russia would consider not blocking action."

Kerry played down concerns that any U.S. military strike over chemical weapons might provoke a clash with Russia.

"Foreign Minister (Sergei) Lavrov has made it clear ... Russia does not intend to fight a war over Syria," Kerry told a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

A senior Western official said that while Moscow was unlikely to say so in public, there were signs Russian officials believe Assad was responsible for the deaths on August 21 and that it had strained Russian support for him - providing an opening for a new, concerted drive to end the conflict.

However, Putin's characteristically blunt tone towards the U.S. position appeared to limit prospects for a breakthrough in a stalemate that has prevented international action to rein in a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 Syrians and left millions homeless but which neither side has been able to win.

"DEFECTION"

Numerous defections over the past two years by senior commanders, either to the rebel Free Syrian Army or into exile abroad, have not led to a collapse of Assad's defenses.

Labwani of the Syrian National Coalition told Reuters.

Other sources also said Habib had fled but Syrian state television denied he had left his home. Turkey's foreign minister said he could not confirm the general had defected.

The flight of Habib, if confirmed, would lend credibility to suggestions that parts of the Alawite community may be turning against Assad. Previous high-level defections have generally involved Sunni officers.

"Ali Habib has managed to escape from the grip of the regime and he is now in Turkey, but this does not mean that he has joined the opposition. I was told this by a Western diplomatic official," Labwani said from Paris.

A Gulf source told Reuters that Habib had crossed the Turkish frontier late on Tuesday with two or three other people. He was taken across the border in a convoy of vehicles.

Kerry said he did not know if the report of Habib's defection was correct but "there are currently defections taking place. I think there are something like 60 to 100 in the last day or so, officers and enlisted personnel."

In an interview on Britain's Sky News, Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior adviser to Assad, made no mention of the defection. She said the world should wait for the outcome of a United Nations investigation into the use of chemical weapons and blamed groups linked to al Qaeda for the alleged gas attack last month.

MILITARY PLANS

Following the failure of British Prime Minister David Cameron to win parliamentary backing for air strikes last week, Washington has been struggling to build an international coalition for action in the absence of a U.N. resolution.

Kerry told lawmakers that at least 10 countries had pledged to participate in a U.S. military intervention in Syria, but he did not identify them nor say what roles they might play.

France and Turkey are the most significant military powers lining up behind Obama. The French parliament debated Syria on Wednesday, though President Francois Hollande does not need approval for action.

French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told parliament that failure to strike Assad would send a message to the likes of Iran and North Korea that they could defy Western powers with impunity, notably over concerns about their nuclear programs.

Obama has won the backing of key figures in the U.S. Congress, including among his Republican opponents.

But in a sign of the tough road still ahead, Democrats and Republicans took both sides in the Senate committee vote. Two Democrats, Tom Udall and Chris Murphy, joined Republicans Marco Rubio, John Barrasso, James Risch, Ron Johnson and Rand Paul in voting no.

In the Senate, Democratic leader Harry Reid is guardedly confident that a majority of the 100 members will vote yes, but is still unsure if he can get the 60 votes needed to overcome Republican procedural roadblocks, aides said.

In the 435-member House, a senior Republican aide predicted that most of the 50 or so Republicans backed by the anti-big government Tea Party movement will vote no. A number of Democratic liberals are also expected to vote against a resolution, placing the final outcome in doubt.

With another election not due until 2016, such an outcome would put Abbott in the driving seat to win a second term.

FORTUNATE TIMING

Developments offshore should also augur well for Abbott, with a marked improvement in economic news from the rich world in the past month or so.

The United States has gained enough traction that the Federal Reserve can consider reining back on stimulus, while Europe has emerged from recession.

Japan has boasted its best growth in years, and fears of a hard landing for China have faded in the face of better data on manufacturing and trade.

The latter is particularly good news for Australia as the Asian giant takes fully a third of its exports and is by far the biggest consumer of its iron ore, a A$60 billion-a-year boon to its trade accounts.

Indeed, figures out Thursday showed no slacking in demand for the ore. Australia's Port Hedland, which handles about a fifth of the global seaborne market for the steel-making material, reported shipments to China rose 9 percent in August, up a hefty 33 percent on the same month last year.

"Finally, all the evidence now points to a renaissance of growth in the advanced economies," said Scott Haslem, an economist at UBS.

He noted that while instability in some emerging markets, such as India and Brazil, had garnered a lot of headlines, those countries accounted for only 12 to 13 percent of global output.

In comparison, the economies that were stabilizing, which includes China, were four times larger at 55 percent of output.

"This suggests greater upside risks, than downside risks, to global growth from here."

Another timely blessing for Abbott has been the decline in the Australian dollar. For almost all of the last three years of Labor government it had been punishingly high, hollowing out manufacturing and crimping export earnings.

Since most of Australia's resource exports are priced in U.S. dollars, a high local currency lessens returns to miners, and so profits and tax receipts.

Fortunately for Abbott, then, that the currency has fallen by 14 percent since April, delivering a major windfall to miners and the next government's bottom line.

The RBA has made much of research that implies a 10 percent decline in the currency will stimulate economic growth by between 0.5 and 1 percentage point over two years.

"The Aussie is once again playing its traditional role as an income buffer," said Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

"The main beneficiaries of this income buffering should be corporate profits and government tax revenues related to that profit story."

NO AUSTERITY PLEASE, WE'RE AUSTRALIAN

Having spent the past three years excoriating the Labor government for running deficits and accusing it of taking debt to crisis levels, Abbott has since abandoned all pretence of trying to get into the black in his first term of office.

Net government debt is expected to peak at 13 percent of GDP in the year ending June 2015, and the budget deficit for the current fiscal year is forecast at $30 billion, equal to 1.9 percent of gross domestic product.

Abbott's earlier stance on the deficit had raised the prospect of a dose of European-style austerity, which is now widely seen as having needlessly deepened the recession in Europe and actually only added to government debt problems.

Such was the threat that it moved U.S. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz to write a warning piece for the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper this week.

"The political spotlight has fallen on the perceived problem of government debt, with alarming proposals to bring austerity 'down under'," Stiglitz wrote.

"Proposals for substantial budget cuts seem particularly misplaced at this time given that Australia's economy is confronting new global challenges."

Yet he needn't have worried, because a return to budget surpluses now sounds more of an aspiration than a target.

Instead, Abbott conjured up a 10-year timetable to reach a "believable surplus", a distant goal that would also require his party to win three elections in a row, and told ABC television he was aiming for relatively modest savings.

"I don't think anyone is going to think at the end of this week, 'My God, there is this massive fiscal squeeze coming.' If anything, what they will think is there has been a massive scare campaign," Abbott reassured viewers.



headline: U.S. resolution on Syria strike passes first hurdle in Senate
byline: By Patricia Zengerle and Khaled Yacoub Oweis
6:20pm EDT

U.S. President Barack Obama's effort to win legislative backing for military strikes against Syria passed its first hurdle on Wednesday when a Senate committee voted in favor, but the narrow margin of victory showed the depth of U.S. caution.

In a possible sign of internal unrest in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's ruling Alawite sect in the shadow of a likely U.S. intervention, Syrian opposition figures said General Ali Habib, a former defense minister, had defected. Syria denied the report.

Washington and Syria's main backer, Russia, remained publicly at odds as Obama tried to build his case for military action over chemical weapons before flying to Russia for a G20 summit hosted by President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.

Putin said U.S. congressional approval without a U.N. Security Council resolution would be an act of aggression, and accused U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry of lying by playing down the role of the militant group al Qaeda with rebel forces.

With Obama focused on building international support, administration officials kept up their campaign of persuasion in Congress, where deep U.S. skepticism about going to war was reflected in a House of Representatives hearing.

Still, after much jockeying over the exact wording, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a resolution authorizing the use of military force in Syria in a vote that avoided party lines, with Democrats and Republicans on both sides. The action cleared the way for a vote in the full Senate, likely next week.

The committee voted 10-7 in favor of a compromise resolution that sets a 60-day limit on any engagement in Syria, with a possible 30-day extension, and bars the use of U.S. troops on the ground for combat operations.

The administration is trying to balance the views of many in Congress who want a narrowly defined resolution against hawks such as Senator John McCain, who has pushed for a broader resolution that would allow direct U.S. support for rebels.

The Senate committee adopted amendments proposed by McCain with policy goals of degrading Assad's ability to use chemical weapons, increasing support for rebel forces and reversing battlefield momentum to create conditions for Assad's removal.

The authorization still faces significant resistance in Congress, where many lawmakers fear it could lead to a prolonged U.S. military involvement in Syria's civil war and spark an escalation of regional violence.

The full Senate is expected to vote on the resolution next week. The House of Representatives also must approve the measure.

RUSSIAN TENSIONS

Obama said he would continue to try to persuade Putin of the need for punitive strikes on Assad for using chemical weapons when the two meet in St. Petersburg.

In Stockholm en route to Russia, Obama said the credibility of America and of the world was at stake. He appeared to take umbrage at a reporter's question about the "red line" he set for Assad at an August 2012 White House news conference.

"I did not set a red line. The world set a red line," Obama said, referring to bans on chemical weapons use.

Putin again questioned Western evidence. He accused Kerry outright of lying when, in urging Congress to approve strikes on Syria, Kerry played down the role of al Qaeda in the rebel forces. "Al Qaeda units are the main military echelon, and they know this," Putin said.

"He is lying and knows he is lying. It's sad."

Earlier, Putin had said in a pre-summit interview with the Associated Press that he could not absolutely "rule out" Russia supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution to punish Assad - if it could be proved he had used poison gas.

Briefing members of Congress in Washington, Kerry said those comments were "hopeful" and "there may be a road forward where Russia would consider not blocking action."

Kerry played down concerns that any U.S. military strike over chemical weapons might provoke a clash with Russia.

"Foreign Minister (Sergei) Lavrov has made it clear ... Russia does not intend to fight a war over Syria," Kerry told a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

A senior Western official said that while Moscow was unlikely to say so in public, there were signs Russian officials believe Assad was responsible for the deaths on August 21 and that it had strained Russian support for him - providing an opening for a new, concerted drive to end the conflict.

However, Putin's characteristically blunt tone towards the U.S. position appeared to limit prospects for a breakthrough in a stalemate that has prevented international action to rein in a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 Syrians and left millions homeless but which neither side has been able to win.

"DEFECTION"

Numerous defections over the past two years by senior commanders, either to the rebel Free Syrian Army or into exile abroad, have not led to a collapse of Assad's defenses.

Labwani of the Syrian National Coalition told Reuters.

Other sources also said Habib had fled but Syrian state television denied he had left his home. Turkey's foreign minister said he could not confirm the general had defected.

The flight of Habib, if confirmed, would lend credibility to suggestions that parts of the Alawite community may be turning against Assad. Previous high-level defections have generally involved Sunni officers.

"Ali Habib has managed to escape from the grip of the regime and he is now in Turkey, but this does not mean that he has joined the opposition. I was told this by a Western diplomatic official," Labwani said from Paris.

A Gulf source told Reuters that Habib had crossed the Turkish frontier late on Tuesday with two or three other people. He was taken across the border in a convoy of vehicles.

Kerry said he did not know if the report of Habib's defection was correct but "there are currently defections taking place. I think there are something like 60 to 100 in the last day or so, officers and enlisted personnel."

In an interview on Britain's Sky News, Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior adviser to Assad, made no mention of the defection. She said the world should wait for the outcome of a United Nations investigation into the use of chemical weapons and blamed groups linked to al Qaeda for the alleged gas attack last month.

MILITARY PLANS

Following the failure of British Prime Minister David Cameron to win parliamentary backing for air strikes last week, Washington has been struggling to build an international coalition for action in the absence of a U.N. resolution.

Kerry told lawmakers that at least 10 countries had pledged to participate in a U.S. military intervention in Syria, but he did not identify them nor say what roles they might play.

France and Turkey are the most significant military powers lining up behind Obama. The French parliament debated Syria on Wednesday, though President Francois Hollande does not need approval for action.

French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told parliament that failure to strike Assad would send a message to the likes of Iran and North Korea that they could defy Western powers with impunity, notably over concerns about their nuclear programs.

Obama has won the backing of key figures in the U.S. Congress, including among his Republican opponents.

But in a sign of the tough road still ahead, Democrats and Republicans took both sides in the Senate committee vote. Two Democrats, Tom Udall and Chris Murphy, joined Republicans Marco Rubio, John Barrasso, James Risch, Ron Johnson and Rand Paul in voting no.

In the Senate, Democratic leader Harry Reid is guardedly confident that a majority of the 100 members will vote yes, but is still unsure if he can get the 60 votes needed to overcome Republican procedural roadblocks, aides said.

In the 435-member House, a senior Republican aide predicted that most of the 50 or so Republicans backed by the anti-big government Tea Party movement will vote no. A number of Democratic liberals are also expected to vote against a resolution, placing the final outcome in doubt.



headline: Moldova says will stick to pro-Europe course despite Russian pressure
headline: Weapon of choice against al Qaeda, drones marginal in Syria
byline: By Tabassum Zakaria and David Alexander
6:20pm EDT

Prowling the skies of Pakistan and Yemen, armed drones are America's weapon of choice in its war against al Qaeda, but they are unlikely to play a major role in any U.S. strike against Syria, underscoring the limitations of unmanned aircraft.

Drones do not have the capability for air-to-air combat and would be vulnerable to Syria's defense system of surface-to-air missiles and radar which can track and shoot down warplanes, never mind slower-moving drones.

The Hellfire missiles generally carried by drones also lack the firepower of a cruise missile, which is considered the likely weapon for any limited U.S. strike against President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Washington blames Assad's government for a chemical weapons attack near Damascus last month.

"It's well-known that the Syrian air defense system is robust," a U.S. defense official said. "Drones, like any other (aerial) platform, are vulnerable to integrated air defenses."

Used for protecting American troops in largely uncontested air space in Iraq and Afghanistan, and killing terrorism suspects in Pakistan and Yemen, drones can be remotely piloted from bases in the United States, avoiding risk to the lives of U.S. military personnel operating them.

U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen increased dramatically under President Barack Obama and the pilotless aerial vehicles have become a key part of the fight against al Qaeda. The United States has also used them over Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya and Iraq, and this year received approval to base drones in Niger.

However, the situation in Syria is not suited to the use of armed drones - not at least for the moment.

"If we don't control the air space then they (armed drones)are slow, they are noisy, they are very easy to shoot right out of the sky. They are really not all that useful when it comes to states like Syria," said Audrey Kurth Cronin, a public policy professor at George Mason University.

The armed drones generally carry Hellfire missiles which have a 20-pound warhead, although some of the larger models can drop a 500-pound bomb.

By contrast, Tomahawk missiles carry a much bigger punch with a 1,000-pound warhead and fly just below the speed of sound, making them less vulnerable to air defenses.

The United States has four guided missile destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea which can carry Tomahawk missiles, which have a range of about 1,000 miles.

SOME DRONES ON BORDER

If Syrian air defenses were hit in a U.S. strike, then drones could be used for surveillance and perhaps targeted strikes, although bringing them in at a later point could signal a more protracted engagement than Obama has suggested he is seeking in Syria, analysts said.

The U.S. Air Force has remotely piloted aircraft at the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey but U.S. officials would not discuss their mission.

They have been used in the past for surveillance along the Turkish-Syrian border, but it is not clear whether they are currently conducting surveillance inside Syria.

The United States also operates the RQ-170 Sentinel spy drone. The surveillance plane has a bat-wing, radar-evading shape, but its shortcomings were evident in 2011 when one crash-landed in Iran. Iran claimed to have taken control of the drone and forced it down, but U.S. officials denied that.

"We think of drones as a substitute for a stealth bomber or something - and they are not at all," said Daniel Byman, a Middle East security expert at the Brookings Institution.

While much has been made of Assad's network of Russian-made surface-to-air missiles, some experts say the effectiveness of the air defenses may have been overplayed.

"One of the problems that everybody has is that nobody really knows what the Syrian system can do," said Anthony Cordesman, a security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.



headline: Russia warns of catastrophe if Syria reactor hit by U.S. strike
headline: Philippines says China moving to occupy disputed reef
byline: By Rosemarie Francisco and Manuel Mogato
6:20pm EDT

China plans to occupy a disputed chain of reefs and rocks in the South China Sea to expand its territory before regional rules on maritime behavior come into effect, the Philippines' top diplomat said on Wednesday.

The Philippines believes China's incursion into the Scarborough Shoal is a threat to peace in Southeast Asia, said Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario.

In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman described the shoal - which lies about 125 nautical miles off the Philippines' main island of Luzon - as China's "inherent territory".

In an interview with Reuters in his Manila office, del Rosario said the Philippines would file a diplomatic protest against China after it discovered concrete blocks on the shoal, which Chinese ships have occupied since April last year.

He urged regional governments to speed up talks on a binding code of conduct (CoC) governing behavior at sea.

"We think that China is trying to stay ahead of the CoC," he said. "We think that they have an assertion agenda that they are trying to complete before they are able to sit down and negotiate a CoC."

Tension over the South China Sea, one of the world's most strategically important waterways, has risen as China uses its growing naval might to assert extensive claims over the oil- and gas-rich waters more forcefully, fuelling fears of a military clash.

Four of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including Vietnam and the Philippines, have overlapping claims with China. Taiwan also has claims over the entire sea.

"This kind of activity places the region in jeopardy in terms of peace and stability," del Rosario said.

"If the Philippines is the target of China today, another country could be the target tomorrow. So this should be considered as a regional issue."

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei, asked about the Philippine's latest accusations, said they were not true, though he did not provide details.

"What the Philippines said of the situation is not true. The Scarborough Shoal is China's inherent territory," he told reporters in Beijing.

"Based on the present circumstances the Chinese government's official ships have been conducting normal patrols in the waters around the Scarborough Shoal in order to safeguard its sovereignty ... This is China's legitimate right and cannot be questioned."

"LARGER CHALLENGE"

China and the Philippines accuse each other of violating a 2002 declaration of conduct, a non-binding confidence-building agreement on maritime behavior signed by China and ASEAN.

Del Rosario said the latest Chinese activity in Scarborough Shoal was discussed at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, where fresh surveillances pictures were shown.

"If we looked back to what they did in Mischief Reef, this could very well be a repetition of what happened there," he said, adding the latest incursion was "a significant and larger challenge" for the country.

In February 1995, the Philippines discovered a cluster of huts in half-submerged Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, 130 miles off its coast. Several years later, the shelters which China had said were meant as shelter for fishermen, had been turned into a multi-level concrete fortress.

Philippine officials said the concrete pillars and blocks in Scarborough Shoal appeared to have been dropped from an aircraft, describing them as possible material for permanent structures.

It could be the first case of occupation of an uninhabited feature in the South China Sea since the 2002 code was signed.

headline: Britain names new envoy to try to reshape EU ties
byline: By Peter Griffiths
6:20pm EDT

One of Prime Minister David Cameron's most senior advisors is to become Britain's new ambassador to the European Union, the government said on Wednesday, a role at the center of efforts to reshape ties with the EU before a possible in/out referendum.

Former finance ministry official Ivan Rogers, who advises Cameron on the EU and global issues, will be handed one of the toughest jobs in diplomacy at a historic moment in Britain's often tortured relationship with its biggest trading partner.

If re-elected in 2015, Cameron has promised to give Britons an EU membership referendum by the end of 2017, raising the prospect that the world's sixth largest economy could leave an organization it first joined in 1973.

A senior British diplomatic source said Rogers was "close to Cameron's thinking", adding: "It is going to be a very political role for the next three to four years."

The appointment of the Oxford-educated father-of-two was not universally popular.

Eurosceptics in Cameron's Conservative Party, a rebellious faction which has repeatedly challenged the prime minister's authority in parliament, pointed out that Rogers has worked for two of the biggest EU supporters in British politics.

He was once chief advisor to Ken Clarke, a Conservative cabinet minister who is one of the government's most vocal EU cheerleaders. He was also chief-of-staff to Leon Brittan, a former vice-president of the European Commission.

'MAGIC FORMULAE'

Former Europe Minister Denis MacShane said Rogers "knows Europe backwards" and is among the "crĂ¨me de la crĂ¨me" of British officials. He faces a daunting task.

"His job is to find more magic formulae than you'd find in a Harry Potter book to try and allow the prime minister of the day to sell what he wants to the British people," MacShane told Reuters.

The EU renegotiation could help decide if Cameron wins the next election in 2015 or whether he loses ground to the UK Independence Party, which argues Britain should leave the EU to shake off what it says is its stifling bureaucracy and meddling interference in everyday British life.

Germany and France have told Britain they will block attempts to cherry-pick from EU policy. However, Cameron is gambling on being able to reclaim some powers and wining allies for EU-wide reforms that can be presented as a British victory.

Rogers, an experienced civil servant who has held a succession of powerful jobs at the heart of government, will be crucial to that task.

He was in charge of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair's office and has been director of EU policy at the finance ministry. He has worked as Cameron's "sherpa" at G8 meetings, preparing the ground before leaders arrive for talks.

He also has private sector experience, having worked as the head of the public sector groups at Barclays Capital and Citigroup.

"I am honored to be appointed ... at this important time," Rogers said in a statement. He starts his new job in November.

He will replace Jon Cunliffe, who becomes deputy governor of the Bank of England.

Rogers' replacement as Cameron's Europe advisor will be Tom Scholar, who has worked as his G20 sherpa.

headline: German spy agency sees Assad behind gas attack, cites phone call
byline: By Alexandra Hudson
6:20pm EDT

Assad ordered a poison gas attack last month and that it considered the move a mistake which showed he was losing his grip, according to German intelligence.

Participants at a confidential meeting of German lawmakers on Monday said the head of the BND foreign intelligence agency told them it had intercepted a phone call believed to be between a high-ranking member of the Lebanese Shi'ite militant group and the Iranian Embassy in Damascus.

"The BND referred to a phone call they had heard between a Hezbollah official and the Iranian embassy in which he spoke about Assad having ordered the attack," one of the participants told Reuters.

In the phone call, the Hezbollah official says Assad's order for the attack was a mistake and that he was losing his nerve, the participants reported the BND briefing as saying. Both Iran and Hezbollah support Assad.

A BND spokesman declined to comment on Monday's briefing, saying German intelligence speaks only to the government and to parliamentary committees on highly sensitive matters.

A Hizbollah spokesman was not available for comment.

The U.S. government says about 1,400 people, hundreds of them children, died near Damascus on August 21 in what it says was a sarin gas attack by the Syrian government.

U.S. President Barack Obama is seeking Congressional backing for taking military action against Assad and Frace has also called for strikes. But British Prime Minister David Cameron failed last week to win parliamentary backing for any action against Syria.

France's military and foreign intelligence services submitted to French lawmakers on Monday a report suggesting that forces loyal to Assad in the country's two-year-old civil war, had carried out the attack.

"CURVEBALL"

On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Syrian leader's most powerful ally, said he could not entirely rule out Russian backing for military action against Damascus if it could be proved that Assad was really behind the attack.

Moscow has suggested al Qaeda-linked rebels may have carried out the gassing.

Syria will top the agenda of world leaders' talks in the Russian city of St. Petersburg later this week.

One participant at the Berlin meeting said German lawmakers of all parties were skeptical about a military intervention in Syria and had quizzed the BND over faulty intelligence on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq used to justify the U.S.-led invasion of 2003. No such weapons were found.

In 2011 Britain's Guardian newspaper reported Iraqi defector Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, codenamed "curveball", had made up claims told to German intelligence officials that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction to help topple his government.

The information from Janabi formed the basis of a 2003 speech by former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell before the United Nations Security Council.

Some German lawmakers also expressed concern that German intelligence on Syria could be used by the United States to justify military intervention without a U.N. mandate.

Berlin has ruled out participation in a military intervention in Syria, which would be deeply unpopular at home.

Last month a German naval reconnaissance vessel, the Oker, sailed from Sardinia to the eastern Mediterranean. German media reported that the boat is fitted with technology to eavesdrop on activities in Syria.



headline: Libya PM warns time running out for oil protests
byline: By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
6:20pm EDT

Libya's patience with protesters who have halted its onshore oil output is running out and action against them nearer, Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said on Wednesday.

"The government has been patient," Zeidan said. "To preserve national unity we saw fit to use all peaceful means to resolve this issue but at some point we may reach a point in which the state should exercise its role seriously to stop this."

Oil industry executives say Zeidan's shaky central government risked widening violence that could descend into civil war if it uses force to recapture oilfields.

Libya's oil production has fallen further to around 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) - from around 1.4 million bpd in April - confined to offshore rigs protestors cannot reach, a National Oil Corp (NOC) official said.

Armed groups have also threatened to close the Wafa gas field, which if shut would cause severe power shortages in the capital, an oil official told Reuters.

Wafa, in the south west, is the only major gas field left open to supply power stations. Libya is importing much more diesel and fuel oil for electricity plants that previously relied on gas.

Crude oil exports have fallen to around 80,000 bpd, several traders close to the matter said, confined to the offshore Bouri and Al Jurf platforms. Crude exports from the Brega port have been diverted to keep the Zawiya oil refinery in the west running.

"Those Libyans who stopped exports, this is a national crime that is tantamount to treason, because you are cutting the income of Libyans. You are someone who had been entrusted with the task of protecting the country's wealth, yet you are abusing it for your ends," Zeida told a news conference.

In the east, where most oil production is based, many of the workers and armed militias that guard oil installations are pushing federalist demands and calling for a bigger share in the country's oil wealth. Others press for changes in management and higher pay.

LOST REVENUES

Finance Minister Alkilani Abdelkarim Al-Jazi said the stoppages have cost Libya billions of dollars in lost revenue and were already affecting its $52 billion budget, almost entirely dependent on oil and gas revenue.

OPEC-member Libya was forced to suspend contractual obligations with a force majeure on most exports to reduce its losses.

Zeidan said foreign firms that have joint ventures with Libya in the oil industry understood the difficulties it faced.

"I don't think this matter will take a long time. We told them we are going to solve it soon. We are partners and have a long history of dealing," he said.

Only three export terminals remain open: Marsa Brega and the offshore Jurf and Bouri platforms.

There were two vessels waiting to load at the port of Hariqa in far eastern Libya which were having difficulty finding crude from shut oilfields, the NOC official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.

The energy committee of the General National Assembly, in touch with senior oil officials, said in a statement that the stoppages were "causing huge losses to the Libyan state that would directly impact the livelihoods of ordinary Libyans."

"Production has stopped as a result of the port closures and production has reached almost zero," said Naji Mukhtar, the head of the GNA's energy committee.

Mukhtar said the continued strike was hurting Libya's international credibility and risked losing it long term customers.



headline: Mali's new president promises to bring peace, fight graft
byline: By Tiemoko Diallo and Adama Diarra
6:20pm EDT

Mali's new president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, pledged to stamp out corruption and bring peace to the turbulent north as he was sworn in on Wednesday, 18 months after a coup and rebel uprising plunged the gold exporter into chaos.

The former prime minister won last month's runoff vote by a landslide - the first election since soldiers took the capital and Tuareg separatists and Islamist insurgents seized the northern half of the country.

Keita told a packed auditorium he would unite the fractured country - once seen as a haven of stability in West Africa - and thanked France for its military intervention that drove al Qaeda-linked fighters out of the vast desert territory.

France did not tackle the separatists - saying their uprising was a domestic matter - and Mali's government has already promised to start talks with the Tuaregs, currently clustered in their remote northeastern stronghold of Kidal.

"National reconciliation is our most pressing priority," said Keita, wearing a yellow presidential sash across a business suit. "From tomorrow, we will take appropriate steps to bring a lasting peace to break this cycle of rebellions in the north."

Light-skinned Tuaregs, demanding greater autonomy from the black African-dominated southern capital Bamako, have launched four rebellions since independence from France in 1960.

Previous peace deals promising development to the region have been undone by rampant corruption and a lack of trust.

MALI AT CROSSROADS

Many in the populous south are bitterly opposed to ceding more autonomy and funds to the northerners, who they blame for their country's implosion last year.

Keita, known by his initials IBK, has promised to convene a national convention to discuss devolution of authority to the regions, both in the north and south.

Keita also faces a daunting task in reviving Mali's economy, which shrank by 1.2 percent last year. Mali is sub-Saharan Africa's third largest gold exporter.

His hand will be strengthened by 3.25 billion euros ($4.28 billion) in reconstruction aid pledged at a conference in Brussels in May.

Advocacy groups have urged Keita to tackle deep-rooted corruption. Junior military officers said widespread anger over graft was one of the triggers of their March 2012 coup.

"Mali stands at a crossroads," said Corinne Dufka of Human Rights Watch. "President Keita's actions - or inactions - could usher in greater respect for human rights or a return to the problems that caused Mali's near-collapse last year."

Keita, who earned a reputation for toughness in crushing student protests as prime minister during the 1990s, pledged to restore the rule of law.

"I will bring an end to impunity," he said. "I will fight corruption tirelessly. No-one will be able to illicitly enrich themselves at the expense of the Malian people."

Analysts have called on Keita to use the mandate from his overwhelming victory in the August 11 election to appoint a cabinet of capable technocrats, rather than political allies.

6:20pm EDT

Gunmen shot dead at least 16 members of a Shi'ite Muslim family before blowing up their two neighboring homes south of the Iraqi capital overnight, police and medics said.

The attack took place in the town of Latifiya, around 40 km (25 miles) from Baghdad, in a volatile area known as the "triangle of death".

It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack but Sunni militants who view Shi'ites as apostastes have been regaining momentum in their insurgency and striking with a ferocity not seen in years.

"We were sitting in our house when some gunmen opened fire at us through the windows," said a teenage girl wearing a red headscarf and dress, seated on the bed of her 6-year-old brother in a hospital ward. Both their heads were bandaged.

"My father stood and moved toward the door. They shot him dead immediately. They shot my sister dead. They were shooting randomly."

Outside the hospital, people thought to be relatives of the victims wept as they waited to receive the bodies of the dead, which included women and children. One woman struck her head in grief, crying "God is Greatest!"

More than two years of civil war in neighboring Syria have aggravated deep-rooted sectarian divisions in Iraq, fraying an uneasy government coalition of Shi'ite, Sunni and ethnic Kurdish factions.

About 800 Iraqis were killed in August, according to the United Nations, with more than a third of the attacks in Baghdad.

The bloodshed, 18 months after U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq, has stirred concerns about a return to the sectarian slaughter of 2006-07, when the monthly death toll sometimes topped 3,000.

Late on Tuesday, a series of car bombs across Baghdad killed nearly 60 people in predominantly Shi'ite districts, police and medics said.

Separately on Wednesday, a suicide bomber attacked a police headquarters in the northern city of Mosul, killing five policemen. A roadside bomb also struck a patrol in Tarmiya, north of Baghdad, killing five soldiers.

India's lower house of parliament approved changes aimed at luring foreign asset managers to run retirement funds, a small victory in government efforts to rescue the economy before elections next year.

Wednesday's vote will slightly loosen rules governing foreign investment in pensions, and is a step towards creating a viable private pension industry to cater to the growing middle class in the world's second most populous nation.

"When the bill is passed, I expect that some more FDI will come in," Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said after the debate, referring to foreign direct investment.

The bill must now go to the upper house, where it is expected to get final approval.

But foreign firms say the new law is unlikely to immediately trigger the flood of investment the government is looking for to kickstart Asia's third largest economy and help stem a sharp depreciation in the rupee.

The bill links the ceiling on foreign investment in pensions to a related law governing the insurance industry. A revised insurance law in the works would raise the cap to 49 percent from 26 percent in insurance, and therefore pensions, but it is opposed by opposition parties and unlikely to be approved soon.

Even at 49 percent, some fund managers say India's current economic crisis means new investors will be slow to step up.

"This is a welcome push for the industry as the bill has a progressive approach, but increasing the FDI cap in the pension sector might not immediately result in a large inflow of foreign capital," said Anil Ghelani, chief investment officer at India's DSP BlackRock Pension Fund Managers Pvt. Ltd, in which U.S.-based BlackRock Inc is a minority partner.

HIGH-PROFILE EXITS

Foreign firms thronged to India when they were allowed to invest in the insurance and mutual fund industries last decade, but once in place they generally found it difficult to flourish.

In the last two years there have been high profile exits such as ING and New York Life from insurance and Fidelity Investments from the mutual fund industry.

The move for pension sector reform comes a decade after India established an interim regulator to steer the industry. So far, there has been little interest from private players, with just eight asset managers, including Blackrock, operating schemes managing about 300 billion rupees ($4.5 billion) in private sector assets.

This compares with the combined 5 trillion rupees ($76 billion) managed by the state-owned provident fund and pension fund and over 7.60 trillion rupees ($115 billion) managed by Indian mutual funds.

The push for a more inclusive pension industry is part of Indian financial planners' broader agenda to expand social support and channel domestic savings into the capital markets.

Most of India's half a billion workers still have little or no access to social security and stick to buying gold and real estate instead.

The new law will regulate private asset managers who run retirement funds under a New Pension Scheme (NPS), open to pension contributions even from workers who do not have a stable monthly income.

At present, almost all pension obligations in the country are managed by the state-owned pension fund, which has been criticized for providing measly inflation-adjusted returns and catering for only a fraction of the workforce. ($1 = 66.0700 Indian rupees)



headline: Berlusconi ups pressure as Senate decision on expulsion nears
byline: By Paolo Biondi
6:20pm EDT

Allies of Silvio Berlusconi stepped up pressure on the shaky coalition government of Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta on Wednesday, threatening to bring it down if the Senate votes to expel the former premier following his conviction for tax fraud.

The fate of Letta's government has been in the balance since last month when Berlusconi, the leader of Italy's center-right, was convicted for being at the center of a giant tax fraud scheme at his Mediaset broadcasting empire.

Senators from Berlusconi's People of Freedom party (PDL) met on Wednesday to discuss tactics and said the government could not continue if the Senate decides to strip Berlusconi of his seat in the upper house.

Asked if Berlusconi's expulsion would mean the government's collapse, PDL Senator Altero Matteoli replied: "Of course."

For weeks, the billionaire media tycoon's supporters have alternated conciliatory signals with threats to pull out of the coalition with the center-left patched together in April after deadlocked elections which left no party able to govern alone.

Italian newspapers on Wednesday carried unsourced reports that Berlusconi had become more pessimistic about his chances of avoiding expulsion and was ready to scupper the government.

"It was always difficult to imagine cooperation between parties that have different positions on so many issues," Maurizio Gasparri, a Berlusconi loyalist and the deputy speaker in the Senate told SkyTG24 television.

He warned that the center-right could not continue to support Letta if a special Senate committee on parliamentary eligibility which is due to meet on Monday on whether to expel Berlusconi became "a political firing squad".

A definitive decision could still be some way off because the Senate would still have to vote in a full sitting before Berlusconi could be expelled.

Italian stocks, which have fluctuated sharply over the past weeks as press headlines have announced either the imminent collapse of the government or its long-term survival, were down by 1.8 percent, with shares in Mediaset down 3.5 percent.

However the risk premium demanded to buy Italian 10 year government bonds instead of safer German Bunds, one of the main gauges of wider investor sentiment, stood at 245 basis points, still well down from levels over 260 points seen last week.

"CARRYING ON"

With Italy still stuck in recession and struggling to contain its public debt, the tensions have re-awakened memories of the turmoil that engulfed the euro zone in 2011 when Berlusconi's last government was forced from office amid fears of a Greek-style debt crisis.

Letta has repeatedly insisted he does not feel threatened by Berlusconi's legal battles and for the moment, signs of tension in the government itself have eased after last week's deal on scrapping the unpopular IMU housing tax.

"We're working on the basis of the government carrying on," one PDL minister told Reuters.

Behind the scenes, lawyers have been working on options including seeking a pardon from President Giorgio Napolitano.

They have also appealed to have the law under which Berlusconi may be expelled from parliament declared unconstitutional and the center-right has pressed for the Senate committee on parliamentary eligibility to delay its decision until the constitutional court decides.

The center-right says the law passed last year, making politicians convicted of offences carrying a sentence of more than two years ineligible for office, should not apply to Berlusconi because the actions for which he was convicted date from before it was passed.

The center-left Democratic Party (PD) and Beppe Grillo's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement have both rejected talk of delaying the committee decision and said they would vote to expel Berlusconi if the issue gets to a full vote. Together they have easily enough votes to oust Berlusconi.

Expulsion from the Senate would be a blow but he could still lead the PDL from outside parliament although he would no longer enjoy the immunity from arrest enjoyed by lawmakers.

headline: Philippines says China expanding territory before code takes effect
byline: By Rosemarie Francisco and Manuel Mogato
6:20pm EDT

China's planned occupation of a disputed shoal in the South China Sea is aimed at expanding its territory ahead of a regional agreement governing maritime rules, the Philippines' top diplomat said on Wednesday.

The Philippines believes China has jeopardized peace and stability in Southeast Asia with its latest incursion, said Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario, and he urged Southeast Asian neighbors to speed up talks on a binding code of conduct (CoC) that will govern behavior in the sea.

The Philippines will be filing a diplomatic protest against China after it discovered concrete blocks on the Scarborough Shoal which Chinese ships have been occupying since April last year, he said.

"We think that China is trying to stay ahead of the CoC, " del Rosario told Reuters in an interview in his Manila office. "We think that they have an assertion agenda that they are trying to complete before they are able to sit down and negotiate a CoC."

"There are some sectors that believe China's delaying action on the CoC is a strategic procrastination on their part ... because the CoC looks forward, not back."

Tension over the South China Sea, one of the world's most important waterways, has risen as China uses its growing naval might to assert its extensive claims over the oil- and gas-rich sea more forcefully, fuelling fear of a military clash.

Four of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including Vietnam and the Philippines, have overlapping claims with China. Taiwan also has claims over the entire sea.

"This kind of activity places the region in jeopardy in terms of peace and stability," del Rosario said.

"If the Philippines is the target of China today, another country could be the target tomorrow. So this should be considered as a regional issue."

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Tuesday he had "no information" about the latest Philippine accusation of an incursion on the shoal.

"LARGER CHALLENGE"

China and the Philippines accuse each other of violating a 2002 declaration of conduct, a non-binding confidence-building agreement on maritime conduct signed by China and ASEAN.

Del Rosario said the latest Chinese activity in Scarborough Shoal, about 125 nautical miles off the Philippines' main island of Luzon, was discussed at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, where fresh surveillances pictures were shown.

"If we looked back to what they did in Mischief Reef, this could very well be a repetition of what happened there," he said, adding the latest incursion was "a significant and larger challenge" for the country.

In February 1995, the Philippines discovered a cluster of huts in half-submerged Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, 130 miles off its coast. Several years later, the shelters which China had said were meant as a resting place for fishermen, had been turned into a multi-level concrete fortress.

Philippine officials said the concrete pillars and blocks in Scarborough Shoal appear to have been dropped from an aircraft, describing them as possible material for permanent structures.

It could be the first case of occupation of an uninhabited feature in the South China Sea since the 2002 code was signed.



headline: "Don't knows" may have it in 2014 Scottish independence vote
byline: By Belinda Goldsmith
6:20pm EDT

With a year until Scotland's referendum on independence, enough voters are "don't knows" to swing the vote and only one in four are certain to vote for separating from Britain, according to an opinion poll on Wednesday.

The survey follows a flurry of warnings from British government figures this year on the potential negative economic impact of independence. Finance minister George Osborne said this week it would make Scotland four percent poorer over the next 30 years and over-dependent on volatile tax receipts from the oil and gas industry.

Scottish nationalists dispute that claim and argue a fully independent Scottish parliament could attract investment through lower taxes and could utilize oil revenues more efficiently.

Wednesday's survey showed that 28 percent of respondents were uncertain about quitting the 300-year-old union, up 13 points from six months ago. The "yes" camp fell to 25 percent from 33 percent, the lowest level of support since polling on independence started in 2007.

Support for an outright "no" was also down, at 47 from 52 percent, the TNS BMRB poll showed.

"The high number of don't knows could turn out to be the most significant factor in how the referendum campaign develops," Tom Costley from TNS Scotland said.

"Both the Yes and No camps have lost ground in 2013, which suggests that neither campaign has yet succeeded in making a strong connection with the voters in Scotland."

Lobby group Yes Scotland also said the most significant figure in the latest survey of 1,017 Scots, conducted between August 21 and August 27, was the rising number of uncertain voters.

Among 16 to 34 year olds, 29 percent said they would vote for independence but only 45 percent were certain to vote, while 70 percent of the over-55s said they would vote but only 20 percent would support a split.

Younger voters were more inclined to support independence but also the least likely to vote, the poll found.

A YouGov survey this week showed 59 percent would vote against independence, an increase of four points on a similar poll 10 months ago, while one in 10 people were undecided.

The latest surveys were released as it was reported that Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond's main adviser, Kevin Pringle, was moving to Yes Scotland.

The move was widely seen as an attempt by Salmond to shore up the SNP's (Scottish National Party) influence in the Yes campaign and bolster backing for independence in opinion polls.

The SNP holds 65 of 129 seats in the Scottish Parliament.



headline: British Labour leader suffers funding setback before 2015 election
byline: By Peter Griffiths
6:20pm EDT

Britain's opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband suffered a double blow on Wednesday when one of his party's biggest donors slashed its funding and an opinion poll exposed serious doubts over his authority.

The survey, carried out early this week, suggested Miliband's standing had failed to benefit from the coalition government's historic defeat in the British parliament over military action in Syria.

Miliband, whose opposition was crucial in Prime Minister David Cameron's shock defeat last week, is already under pressure from some in his centre-left party to improve his lackluster personal ratings and mount a stronger challenge before the next election, due in 2015.

The latest survey gave more ammunition to Miliband's critics, suggesting voters see Cameron as stronger, more charismatic and more decisive. Just 2 percent thought Miliband is a "natural leader", compared to 13 percent for Cameron.

The YouGov poll for the Sun newspaper gave Labour a four point lead over Cameron's Conservatives, well down from the 10 point advantage a separate poll on Monday gave Labour after last week's vote. Twenty YouGov polls in August put the Labour lead at between three and eight points.

Labour lost power after 13 years in 2010 but Cameron failed to win an outright majority and was forced to enter a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.

In a setback for Labour three weeks before its autumn conference, the GMB union said it would cut donations to party campaigns and pass on less money from members.

The loss of an important source of income is the latest episode in a row between the unions and Labour over Miliband's plan to reform ties with the workers' groups that helped found the party more than a century ago.

Miliband, who relied on union support to defeat his brother David in his party's 2010 leadership contest, angered unions in July when he said Labour must transform its links with the labor movement to make politics more transparent.

The union said its decision reflected "considerable regret... that the party that had been formed to represent the interest of working people in this country intends to end collective engagement of trade unions in the party".

The changes would see the GMB's annual fees to Labour sharply cut to 150,000 pounds ($233,000) from 1.2 million pounds. The union did not say how much it would cut from its campaign donations.

Labour finance spokeswoman Rachel Reeves played down the cuts, saying it would raise more from individual members.

"Ed has spoken about the need for greater transparency and openness in that relationship," she told BBC radio.

Labour's planned union reforms are part of a wider debate over party funding and whether donations should be capped.

Cameron accuses Miliband of being in the unions' pocket, while his counterpart says the Conservatives are in the thrall of wealthy business leaders.



headline: South African gold miners' union offers some compromise as strike bites
byline: By Xola Potelwa
6:20pm EDT

A strike for higher pay hit production at most of South Africa's gold mines on Wednesday, but the main union behind the stoppage said it was willing to relax some of its demands .

The stoppage called by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) began at the evening shift on Tuesday, with many miners refusing to go underground.

Producers grouped in the Chamber of Mines said output at 16 of the 23 mines currently involved in talks was partially or severely affected on Wednesday morning.

The operators of the mines include South Africa's main producers AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold and Sibanye Gold.

"The majority of Harmony's operations have been severely affected, although all essential services personnel are at work," the company said in a statement.

However, the NUM, which represents two thirds of the country's gold mine workers, has already opened the prospect of a compromise, saying it was prepared to lower its pay increase demands for some specific employee categories.

In another positive sign, junior producers Village Main Reef and Pan African Resources said they had made separate pay agreements with NUM members in their workforces.

The gold industry stoppage is seen costing South Africa around $35 million a day in lost production, adding to the nation's economic woes as strikes over pay reduce output in other industries such as auto manufacturing.

"We're not working," said a striking miner at Gold Fields' South Deep mine at Westonaria west of Johannesburg. "We'll only go back down when we get our percentage that we've asked for. We've been begging them for too long now," he added, asking not to be named.

Several gold mines visited by Reuters appeared quiet on Wednesday, with security guards refusing to let reporters into the properties.

The peaceful legal strikes contrasted with the often violent illegal stoppages that brought turmoil to South Africa's gold and platinum mines last year, when more than 50 people were killed in labor clashes.

The mayhem slowed South Africa's economic growth and led to sovereign credit downgrades.

The rand recovered from a fall on Tuesday, buoyed by hopes for a smaller than expected dent to foreign currency earnings if the strike ends soon, although it remains close to August's four-year low of 10.51 against the dollar.

On Tuesday, President Jacob Zuma urged employers and unions to avoid another strike in the once iconic gold mining industry, which is now in rapid decline.

South Africa's mines once accounted for close to 80 percent of the world's gold production but its deep and dangerous shafts now only produce 6 percent.

"PREPARED TO MOVE"

NUM spokesman Lesiba Seshoka told SAFM radio on Wednesday that the union had told the employers' Chamber of Mines negotiators: "'If you are prepared to move, then we may be prepared to move,'".

level underground workers, which would take it to 8,000 rand ($770) a month from 5,000 rand. The employers' offer is for a 6.5 percent rise, just above the current inflation rate.

The union's demands also included 15 percent pay rises for all other categories of workers and it was in this specific area that the NUM was willing to show flexibility, Seshoka said.

"For entry-level workers we are still where we were. We have not budged. But from the 15 percent we may be prepared to go lower but will accept nothing below double digits," he said.

In their deals, Village Main Reef and Pan African Resources have settled with their NUM-affiliated workers on salary increases of around 8 percent.

Charmane Russell, a spokeswoman for the producers, said there had been no formal revised offers from either side but they "have come much, much closer to finding one another."

The NUM's tough position over the lowest-paid workers is significant because it has been fighting to retain membership after losing tens of thousands of members to its hardline rival, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), in a union turf war that broke out last year.

The Chamber of Mines says about half of the lower-skilled gold mining workforce of 95,000 would fall into the entry-level category.

AMCU, whose members in the gold sector have not gone on strike yet, is seeking pay hikes of as much as 150 percent under the battle cry of a "living wage" and NUM has become more populist in a bid to fend off this challenge.

"I don't know if the strike will succeed or if it'll fail, but it's the right thing, it must be done so we try and get this money," said Ntsikelelo Sibaya, a 25-year-old mines contractor who said he had lost his job at Gold Fields in July.

Tit-for-tat killings linked to the union rivalry still occur on the platinum belt, where AMCU is now the dominant union and is currently in or about to embark on tough wage talks with producers such as Impala Platinum and Lonmin.



headline: Muslim Brotherhood newspaper soldiers on despite Egypt crackdown
byline: By Maggie Fick
6:20pm EDT

Whenever Muslim Brotherhood journalist Islam Tawfiq files a story about the group's struggle for survival for its newspaper Freedom and Justice, he fears his Internet address will tip off state security agents to his whereabouts.

Thousands of Brotherhood members have been arrested in a widening crackdown on the group since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Mursi on July 3.

Reporters for the newspaper, which still appears in a tiny fraction of its previous circulation, see themselves as the last people left to tell the Brotherhood's side of the story in a country dominated by media that back the military crackdown.

The price, the journalists say, is an underground existence, moving from place to place, communicating from Internet cafes, rarely seeing family or friends.

"The greatest form of jihad is speaking up against an unjust authority," Tawfiq, 27, said by telephone from an undisclosed location, citing the words of the Prophet Mohammad.

The Brotherhood, which won every election after the 2011 revolt that toppled President Hosni Mubarak, has been on the defensive since Mursi's downfall. Security forces crushed pro-Mursi protest camps in Cairo, killing nearly 1,000 people, and forced many members underground.

Many Egyptians turned against the movement after Mursi gave himself sweeping powers and mismanaged the economy. They now revere the man who toppled Mursi, army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

"Part of my goal in my reporting is to fight the coup. Not literally with weapons and blood, but with my way of fighting... as a journalist," said Tawfiq, a slight man with a close-cropped beard who joined the Brotherhood as a boy. "My hope is for my work to be stronger then Sisi's bullets against Egyptians."

"CHARGED ENVIRONMENT"

The Brotherhood developed the skills of clandestine unarmed resistance under the iron rule of one Egyptian military-backed leader after another. This time, the government seems more determined than ever to crush it.

For the reporters, going to the newsroom to discuss stories with editors is no longer an option. Meeting sources in public is out of the question. Most live away from home and might not see their families for weeks at a time.

"It's a charged environment. I expect that things will only get worse for us," said reporter Mohamed el-Azouni, meeting in a Cairo restaurant. He had not seen his family in two months.

He and about 50 others produce Freedom and Justice. It used to be a 16-page daily but is now half that length because, since the arrest of Saad al-Katatni, chairman of the Freedom and Justice Party and the newspaper's financier, it has no money.

"We don't have access to our bank account," said Azouni.

Reporters have not been paid in two months. The paper's print run has been cut from 100,000 to 10,000, and it is now available only in Cairo, not in other towns and cities.

Editors, also in hiding, receive stories by email from reporters who often switch computers to avoid detection by state security agencies.

Assem Ahmed, a 26-year-old photographer for the paper, was one of more than 50 people killed when Republican Guardsmen fired on a pro-Mursi protest in July. His last image was video footage of the sniper firing the shot that killed him.

He was one of at least five journalists from all media killed since July 3.

A mystery is why the government, which has closed down Islamist television channels, still allows the paper to be printed on the presses of the state-run newspaper Al-Ahram.

Some suggest it may help keep tabs on the movement, in the knowledge that the paper is struggling to stay afloat and reaching only a small audience. It also could provide a defense against accusations that the government is suppressing dissent.

None of the paper's staff are now jailed, but police raided the news director's apartment on Saturday, according to Tawfiq, and men broke into the paper's long-shuttered headquarters searching for information on the journalists.

JOURNALISTS UNDER PRESSURE

Rights groups say the climate for local and foreign journalists reporting in Egypt has deteriorated sharply since Mursi was toppled.

On Tuesday a Cairo court ordered the switching off of the main source of news in Egypt that challenged the government's line and reported on Brotherhood demonstrations: a channel of Egypt news from Qatar-based pan-Arab network Al Jazeera.

Three Al Jazeera journalists were expelled from Egypt on Sunday. Several others have been detained, and the station's offices in Egypt have been raided. Al Jazeera complains that its satellite signal has been jammed .

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said last Friday that it knew of 10 journalists in detention, nine raids on news organizations, and at least 64 temporary detentions, assaults or confiscations.

The CPJ's Sherif Mansour said the government had been working to "increase censorship and increase the divide in the media and partisan alignment against the Brotherhood".

The government says any arrests of journalists have been for inciting violence, not for their editorial work.

Despite what seems like overwhelming odds, the Brotherhood's newspaper is still focused on efforts to reverse what it calls a military coup against an elected government. One story this week quoted relatives of top Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie saying he appeared healthy during a prison visit after a report that he had suffered a heart attack.

Political cartoons attack Sisi, the military chief now depicted as a hero in posters across Cairo. One shows him smashing helpless people with his fists.

"This is the definitely the first showing of Sisi as a butcher in the Egyptian press that I'm aware of," said Jonathan Guyer, a scholar researching political cartoons in Egypt.

Almost daily, the paper publishes photographs of Brotherhood "martyrs" killed by security forces at protest camps.

"When a paper is eight pages and the whole centerfold is the names of 'martyrs' ... that is an incredible example of resistance," said Guyer.

Azouni, the reporter, lost his laptop and camera while running for his life at a protest where security forces fired live rounds. He has to borrow computers from friends, or move from one Internet cafe to another.

"We want to reach everyone in every place, in every house, everywhere. We are the voice of those who don't have a voice," he said, looking nervously around him for state security agents.

"We are their only voice."

headline: British soldier fired at twitching bodies in Iraq, ex-private testifies
byline: By Estelle Shirbon
6:20pm EDT

A British soldier saw his platoon sergeant fire automatic rifle rounds into the twitching bodies of two Iraqi gunmen lying on the ground during a battle in 2004, he said in a written witness statement released on Wednesday.

In his evidence to a public inquiry into Iraqi allegations of atrocities by British troops during or after the battle of Danny Boy on May 14, 2004, Duncan Aston also said he had seen a fellow soldier stamp on the head of a dead man.

A private at the time who has since left the army, Aston further described seeing three fellow soldiers punch and kick an Iraqi detainee captured during the firefight, named after a checkpoint near the town of Majar al-Kabir in southern Iraq.

The Al-Sweady Inquiry is investigating a range of allegations including that British troops captured some Iraqis alive and later executed them at their camp, that they mutilated bodies, and that they tortured detainees.

If the inquiry were to confirm the most serious Iraqi allegations, the Danny Boy events would go down as some of the worst atrocities of the Iraq war, inviting comparison with the abuse of prisoners by U.S. troops at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib jail.

The inquiry has no power to prosecute but, depending on its conclusions, military prosecutors could decide to bring charges.

Almost all the 200 British military witnesses who are scheduled to give evidence at the inquiry over the coming months deny that any of the alleged crimes happened.

Aston is one of just five "conflicted witnesses" whose accounts differ and may back up some of the Iraqi allegations.

The inquiry took evidence from 60 Iraqi witnesses between March and June and started hearing the military witnesses on Monday. A final report into the events is expected in late 2014.

In his written statement, released by the inquiry as Aston began giving oral evidence on Wednesday, the former private described a scene during the battle that took place in a ditch where the bodies of six Iraqi gunmen lay on the ground.

He said two of the bodies were twitching and looked as if they were "drifting somewhere between life and death".

"LETTING SOME ANGER GO"

Aston said that Paul Kelly, then his platoon sergeant, approached the ditch looking angry and tried to fire at one of the twitching bodies. The weapon did not fire and Kelly ordered Aston to hand over his own weapon, which Aston said he did.

"He put a full magazine of bullets into both bodies that had been twitching but he also fired into the bodies of the other dead gunmen in the ditch. The bodies of the two twitching gunmen stopped twitching," he said.

Aston said he felt what Kelly had done was "a bit sick and degrading but not something worse" as the men were close to death if not dead already.

Describing a separate incident earlier in the battle, Aston said he saw Steven Wells, a fellow private, stamp on the head of another dead Iraqi while screaming and shouting.

"I thought he was letting some anger go after the firefight," Aston said. He also described seeing Wells and two other privates kicking and punching an Iraqi detainee in a derelict building where he was under guard.

"Everyone was a bit upset about the whole scenario of British soldiers being ambushed and attacked when we felt we were in Iraq to assist," Aston said. Kelly, Wells and the other soldiers are all due to testify to the inquiry later.

Aston said he had not reported the events at the time as "I didn't think it would be best to grass my friends in".

He added: "Now I'm just here ... telling the truth of what happened. I figured if I had withheld the truth now then it would come home and bite me in the arse at some point."



headline: Russian protest leader gives Kremlin a headache in Moscow vote
byline: By Timothy Heritage
6:20pm EDT

Alexei Navalny has thousands of Russians chanting his name within minutes of stepping onto the stage at a boisterous campaign meeting in the race to become Moscow's mayor.

"Can we win this election?" the opposition leader, one of President Vladimir Putin's biggest critics, shouts through a microphone on a makeshift stage outside a Moscow park.

"Yes!" comes the even louder cry from the crowd on a damp summer evening in the Russian capital.

Such scenes are common in Western elections but Navalny's campaign, based on working crowds, mobilizing thousands of volunteers and pressing the flesh, is still a novelty in Russia more than two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The stakes in Sunday's election are high - both for the opposition, which is struggling to revive the momentum of its challenge to Putin, and for the Kremlin.

After a trial that he and his supporters say was politically motivated, Navalny was convicted in July of stealing timber from a state firm and sentenced to five years in prison. In a highly unusual ruling, a judge released him on bail the following day.

Many political observers say the Kremlin wanted Navalny to run in Moscow because it expected him to be humiliated, and believed this would remove him as a political threat.

But Navalny's campaign has had more impact than expected and the gamble is in danger of backfiring on the Kremlin, even though its candidate Sergei Sobyanin is still expected to win.

"The moment any competition was allowed, the moment they let Navalny run, the situation started getting out of the Kremlin's control," said independent political analyst Pavel Salin.

STAID CAMPAIGN

Sobyanin has hardly moved out of first gear in a campaign that harks back to the Soviet system - based largely on staid meetings with officials and voters, blanket television coverage and the avoidance of live debates with the other candidates.

He has let his work as mayor since 2010 do the talking for him - the smart new pedestrian walkways, modern buildings, better car parking and bicycles for hire on street corners.

Backed heavily by state media, Sobyanin is confident that Navalny, 37, has no chance of beating him. Even if he did, it seems unlikely that he could take up the job: unless he wins an appeal, he will start his prison term soon after the election.

In an interview with the Associated Press and Russia's state TV, broadcast on Wednesday, Putin said: "The federal authorities will work with any future Moscow mayor, whoever is elected by Muscovites, that is an absolutely obvious fact."

But the former Soviet spy also said he believed Navalny was not fit for the job because he lacked experience to run the city of nearly 12 million people.

"And in general, when somebody talks of fighting corruption, he himself should be crystal clear first and foremost," Putin said. "But that is problematic."

Navalny's campaign, however, has already left a mark by lifting the opposition's morale, sapped by its failure to force out Putin in protests last year, and undermining the notion that the Kremlin can steer the course of elections as it pleases.

Just preventing from Sobyanin securing more than half the votes on Sunday, and forcing him into a run-off, would be a triumph for Navalny and would likely alarm the Kremlin.

"A second round would be disastrous for the entire political system built by Putin," Navalny's campaign chief, Leonid Volkov, said. "In any case, the campaign has already resulted in total upheaval in the country's political landscape."

POLITICAL SPRINGBOARD

Six candidates are fighting for the right to control Russia's biggest and wealthiest city, its main financial centre and the seat of most big Russian companies.

The campaign has been dominated by issues such as housing, transport, jobs, education, corruption and what to do about an unpopular influx of Central Asian migrant workers who do many of the unskilled and lowly paid jobs in the capital.

Power in Russia is concentrated in the hands of the president but the Kremlin takes a risk if it ignores the person who runs the city with an annual budget of 1.8 trillion roubles ($54 billion).

Yuri Luzhkov, mayor from 1992 until 2010, used Moscow as a power base but became such an irritant that the then president, Dmitry Medvedev, fired him. Boris Yeltsin treated the job, which in Soviet times went under the title of first secretary of the city communist party, as a springboard to Russia's presidency.

Sobyanin, 55, is a former head of the presidential administration who was chosen by the Kremlin to replace Luzhkov and is widely seen as a potential prime minister under Putin.

Sobyanin "is a very experienced person, calm, he doesn't like publicity very much, he's known to even be taciturn. I like such people. He talks less, does more," Putin said.

Navalny, who made his name as an anti-corruption campaigner, has presidential ambitions as well and also sees the mayor's job as a stepping stone to bigger things. He is campaigning under the slogan: "Change Russia, Start with Moscow."

That is a tough task. Protests which began against Putin in big cities in late 2011 failed to take off in the provinces and faded after Putin won a presidential election in March 2012.

But Navalny, who led the Moscow protests, has revived some of the enthusiasm for change among urban youth with his unusually open campaign, taking questions from voters that - in a rarity for Russian politicians - are not orchestrated.

"He's different and the only person I can see who can make a difference. Without him, there's no one to vote for," said Katya Volkova, a student attending one of Navalny's campaign meetings.

LONG STRUGGLE AGAINST THE KREMLIN

Navalny has a tougher time winning over older voters wary of more upheaval after the chaos that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. Opponents accuse him of harboring dangerous xenophobic views and of being a Western stooge - charges he rejects, despite his tough talk of limiting immigration.

He also faces allegations of illegally securing funding from abroad, which he denies. Since announcing his candidacy, he has twice been briefly detained by police, who have also raided a flat where he kept campaign materials.

The Kremlin denies manipulating elections and dismisses allegations by Navalny that the Moscow ballot will be rigged against him. It holds up the fact that he is running as evidence that it is an open race.

Opinion polls show Putin remains Russia's most popular politician and Navalny still has little appeal outside major cities. The president is in no immediate danger of being ousted, the opposition is split, and Putin has tightened his grip with new laws that critics say are designed to smother dissent.

But Navalny's supporters portray his campaign as part of a long-term battle that offers them new hope.

"He may not win but the important thing is to show there is opposition to Putin," said Anna Ivanova, a housewife in her twenties attending a Navalny campaign meeting.

headline: Movie version of Malaysian race riot stirs unease

At a crucial point in the film "Tanda Putera", ethnic Chinese youths urinate on a pole flying the flag of a Malaysian state, setting off events that push the country into a deadly race riot that still haunts the national consciousness four decades later.

The publicly funded movie, which opened recently in Malaysia after a long delay, is stirring up racial sentiment at a sensitive time over its depiction of the ethnic Chinese minority as the aggressors in the violent events of May 13, 1969.

The "bumiputera" system of preferential treatment for ethnic Malays, who make up two-thirds of the population, was born out of the riots and continues to be the number one complaint among the country's ethnic Chinese.

The film, released as Malaysia marked its 56th year of independence and as Prime Minister Najib Razak prepares for a possible leadership battle within his party in October, plays on deep-seated fears at a time when Chinese disloyalty has been blamed for the government's depleted majority in May's election.

The predominantly ethnic Chinese state of Penang has advised cinemas not to screen "Tanda Putera" on the grounds that it crosses a line by using public funds to promote hate.

"Because the film is sponsored by the government, the film is effectively the official version of the riots," Penang's chief minister, Lim Guan Eng, told Reuters.

Creative license should not be used to spread lies that may cause racial disharmony, he added.

That is a charge Shuhaimi Baba, the film's director, denies.

"Historical facts carry many backstories written by different sources on the same subjects," she told Reuters. "Film makers use creative license to put them together in a story or else they become documentaries."

LINGERING TENSION

The movie - whose Malay title means "Mark of a Prince" - was held back before the election in May for fear of alienating ethnic Chinese. Their votes went to the opposition anyway, sharply cutting the government's winning margin.

Hardliners in Najib's United Malay National Organisation party equated the disaffection of ethnic Chinese with betrayal and the intemperate mood has simmered. Najib's cabinet has only two ethnic Chinese ministers, both in minor posts.

Official versions of the 1969 riots are scant on detail.

About 200 people are said to have been killed in the clashes in and around the capital, Kuala Lumpur, after opposition parties supported by the ethnic Chinese community made inroads in a general election three days earlier.

Shuhaimi's film builds the picture of the looming disaster in a series of heavy-handed scenes, portraying the Chinese mainly as shadowy figures who bring mayhem. In contrast, the Malays show restraint and dignity even as events spin out of control.

"Tanda Putera" makes much of the role played by Abdul Razak Hussein, the deputy prime minister at the time and the father of the current prime minister, in securing peace in the face of personal tragedy.

Shown as strong, self-effacing and principled, Razak has no discernible fault in the film. He hides his terminal leukemia, finally succumbing to it in scenes at a London clinic.

The film flays foreign correspondents for biased reporting on the riots and gives a nod to the theory that mainly ethnic Chinese communist elements had a hand in the trouble.

Better known for horror movies, Shuhaimi said the question of too much or too little creative license did not apply in a feature film like "Tanda Putera".

She said she was "now in the midst of getting the film back on screen in Penang".



headline: Putin 'does not rule out' approving Syria strike with evidence Assad used poison gas
byline: By Thomas Grove
6:20pm EDT

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia did not rule out approving a military operation in Syria if clear evidence showed Damascus had carried out chemical weapons attacks, but said any attack would be illegal without U.N. support.

In an interview with AP and Russia's First Channel, released the day before a G20 leaders' meeting in St Petersburg, Putin said he expected to hold talks with the U.S. President Barack Obama on the summit sidelines, saying there was much to discuss.

Ties between the United States and Russia have fallen to one of their lowest points since the end of the Cold War over numerous issues including violence in Syria, where Russia has been President Bashar al-Assad's most powerful protector.

Putin's comments appeared intended to show readiness to remain constructive in U.S.-Russia ties, despite Obama's decision to pull out of a bilateral summit between the leaders.

Obama comes to St Petersburg having secured support from key figures in the U.S. Congress for his call for limited U.S. strikes on Syria.

When asked whether Russia would agree to military action if Damascus were proven to have carried out a chemical weapons attack, Putin answered: "I do not rule it out."

However, he also made clear that Russia is not yet prepared to accept U.S. and European assertions that Assad's forces were behind an August 21 chemical weapons attack that Washington says killed more than 1,400 people.

"We have no data that those chemical substances - it is not yet clear whether it was chemical weapons or simply some harmful chemical substances - were used precisely by the official government army."

Putin said no strikes on Syria could be legal without approval by the United Nations Security Council, where Moscow has a veto that it has repeatedly used to protect Assad.

"According to current international law, only the United Nations Security Council can sanction the use of force against a sovereign state. Any other approaches, means, to justify the use of force against an independent and sovereign state, are inadmissible," he said, adding it would amount to aggression.

The United States and France, its main ally on Syria, say they are prepared to launch strikes without a U.N. Security Council resolution because they believe Moscow would veto any authorization for force.

A senior Western official said that - while Moscow was unlikely to say so in public - there were signs Russian officials believe Assad was indeed responsible for the chemical weapons attack and it had strained Russian support for him.

Western countries are hoping that once any military strikes are finished, probably over Russia's public objections, Moscow will be more cooperative than in the past in seeking a political solution, the official said.

Foreign ministers will also attend the G20 summit and will meet to discuss Syria.

Looking confident and relaxed, Putin said the burden was on other countries to convince Moscow Assad had used chemical arms. Russia has previously said it suspects rebels were behind the attack to provoke a U.S. military response. Putin said there was an "opinion" al Qaeda-linked rebels were to blame.

RUSSIA-U.S. TIES

He also said that Moscow had already sent to Syria some components of an S-300 missile system but was holding off on the delivery of final parts, something Putin threatened could happen if "existing international norms" were violated.

Western governments are concerned about the S-300 surface-to-air system, which could be used against their planes.

"We have supplied separate components, but the whole delivery is not finalized; we have suspended it for now. But if we see steps being undertaken that would violate existing international norms, we will think how to move forward, including on deliveries of such sensitive weapons," Putin said.

Regarding his relationship with Obama, Putin called the U.S. leader "a no-nonsense, practical person," and tried to dispel speculation that body language between the two leaders belied poor personal relations.

After cancelling a bilateral summit with Putin last month Obama said the Russian leader's slouch can sometimes make him look "like the bored kid in the back of the classroom" but that his conversations with Putin were often constructive.

Obama had pulled out of the meeting with Putin, scheduled for before the G20 summit, after Russia granted temporary asylum to fugitive former U.S. spy contractor Edward Snowden, wanted by the United States for leaking information about surveillance programs. Putin said he still hoped to talk with Obama.

"I'm sure that even if we hold a meeting... on the sidelines of the summit, it will be useful in itself. In any case, we have many issues that we have been working on and we are interested in settling them," he said.

headline: Egypt's president says road map on track as Islamists protest
byline: By Asma Alsharif
6:20pm EDT

Egypt's interim president, Adly Mansour, said on Tuesday that a plan for a return to civilian government after the army's removal of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi was on track despite "challenges" and that emergency law should be lifted soon.

His comments were broadcast just after thousands of Islamists took to the streets in towns and cities across Egypt on Tuesday evening to denounce the new military-backed rulers and demand Mursi's return - their second show of mass support in four days.

The interim government has launched a furious crackdown on Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood since toppling Egypt's first freely elected president on July 3, following huge protests.

It has accused the group of terrorism, sent its top leaders to trial on charges of inciting violence or murder and killed hundreds of Islamists demanding his reinstatement, most of them when two Cairo protest vigils were smashed on August 14.

Mansour said in an interview with state television that his decision to announce emergency law that day had not been easy, but "terrorism and the vicious war that was being waged by some of the extremists made it crucial."

If a "gradual improvement in security" continued, the state of emergency should end as planned in mid-September, he said.

Mansour also said a "road map" back to democratic rule, under which the constitution is to be amended, followed by parliamentary and presidential elections early next year, remained on track: "God willing, we will commit ourselves to the timeframe in the coming stages."

"There are no alterations on the priorities of the plan (road map), even though there are some challenges facing us."

Although the army-backed interim government has begun to revive the political security apparatus that was shelved, but not dismantled, after the 2011 revolt that overthrew Hosni Mubarak, Mansour said there would be no return to the days of political police.

"The role of the security apparatus of Egypt is now limited to protecting security and protecting the people ... In terms of political issues, there is no longer a role in that. That was a period that Egypt passed through and it will not return ... I assure you of that."

PROTESTS ACROSS EGYPT

Although the crackdown on the Brotherhood has taken some of the sting out of the anti-government protests, the well organized million-member group has shown it can still mobilize supporters countrywide.

Shortly before the interview was aired, marchers turned out in cities in the Nile Delta, in Upper Egypt, along the Suez Canal, as well as in the capital, to mark exactly two months since Mursi was toppled.

There were no immediate reports of violence at Tuesday's marches, held under the slogan "The Coup is Terrorism" - a reference to the government's portrayal of its campaign to crush the Brotherhood as a fight against Islamist terrorism.

In Cairo's Nasr City, near Mansour's presidential palace, hundreds of marchers waving Brotherhood flags chanted "Revolution, revolution, the revolution will continue!" and "Down, down with military rule!"

Some carried pictures of "martyrs" killed in the government's crackdown, while others stood chanting next to an armored vehicle, one of many deployed in the capital.

There were no reports of violence, a contrast to last Friday's nationwide protests, which resulted in a scattering of clashes with security forces, notably in Cairo, and at least seven deaths.

The Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful protest, and that the accusations are a pretext for the crackdown by a "putschist regime" trying to eliminate Egypt's oldest political grouping, which had won five popular votes since 2011.

A military court sentenced pro-Mursi protesters to long jail terms on Tuesday on charges of attacking soldiers in the city of Suez, a military statement said.

The violence in Suez broke out on August 14 along with clashes across the country after the Cairo protest camps were broken up in a dawn operation in which more than 600 Brotherhood supporters were killed, along with dozens of policemen.

The statement said one person had been sentenced to life in prison for the Suez clashes, three people to 15 years in jail and 45 others to five years.

TV STATIONS SHUT

TV channels run by the Muslim Brotherhood or sympathetic to it have already fallen victim to the government crackdown.

On Tuesday a Cairo court ordered the closure of the Egyptian news channel belonging to Al Jazeera, the pan-Arab broadcaster financed by Qatar, a supporter of the Brotherhood, along with three other stations run by or sympathetic to the Brotherhood.

Al Jazeera's Cairo offices have been closed since they were raided by security forces hours after Mursi was toppled, although its channels, broadcast from Qatar, can still be seen in Egypt.

Separately, state-run Nile TV said 15 people had been killed in the Sinai Peninsula by rocket fire, after witnesses said army helicopters had attacked militant strongholds near Sheikh Zuweid, close to the border with Israel and the Gaza Strip.

Security sources gave a different tally, saying government helicopter strikes had killed at least eight armed men and wounded 15, and had been aimed at stores of arms and explosives.

Militant attacks on security forces in the lawless North Sinai region have grown since Mursi was ousted.

The army has accused Palestinians in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, a Brotherhood offshoot, of supporting the militants.

Mursi's government had made it easier for people and goods to travel between Egypt and Gaza.

But Cairo's new rulers have tightened controls once more, and have been closing smuggling tunnels that the army believes have been used to move weapons and gunmen across the border.

Local residents said on Tuesday that Egyptian security forces had destroyed some 20 houses along the border, apparently suspecting them of being used to hide tunnel entrances or provide cover for other militant activity.

up lobbying effort for American military action.

The statements by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) represented the groups' most public show of support for U.S. military action since the August 21 attack near Damascus in which Syria's government is accused of using chemical weapons to kill more than 1,400 people.

During the past two weeks, the groups had been unusually quiet as the Obama administration sought to build a case for limited strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

Supporters of the groups and government sources acknowledged that the groups had made it known that they supported U.S. action. But, the sources said, the groups generally want the debate to focus on U.S. national security rather than how a decision to attack Syria might help Israel - a reflection of their sensitivity to being seen as rooting for the United States to go to war.

Even so, in recent days Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and other administration officials had emphasized that a mission to degrade Assad's chemical weapons stockpiles would reduce his ability to use them in Syria's civil war and beyond the county's borders.

They also argued that if the United States took a stand against chemical weapons in Syria, it would be a warning to Iran, the Hezbollah militant group and others that might threaten the Jewish state.

Failing to act, the administration has argued, would endanger Israel by allowing instability on its borders and emboldening Iran, which Western powers believe is developing nuclear weapons.

It was unclear precisely why the pro-Israel groups issued their statements on Tuesday. But they followed a 45-minute meeting at the White House in which administration officials briefed Jewish groups on how it is framing the debate on Capitol Hill, according to a government source who was not authorized to speak publicly.

In its statement, AIPAC called on Congress to "support the president's effort to protect American security interests" and "dissuade the Syrian regime's further use of unconventional weapons."

"The civilized world cannot tolerate the use of these barbaric weapons, particularly against an innocent civilian population including hundreds of children," the group said in its statement, which was signed by AIPAC President Michael Kassen and Howard Kohr, the chief executive.

"America must also send a forceful message of resolve to Iran and Hezbollah - both of whom have provided direct and extensive military support to Assad," the AIPAC officials said.

Israel and groups that support it are particularly sensitive to the use of chemical weapons in light of Adolf Hitler use of deadly gas during World War II. Nearly half of the estimated 6 million Jews killed during the war are widely believed to have been gassed at Nazi prison camps.

In the ADL's statement, National Chair Barry Curtiss-Lusher and National Director Abraham Foxman said that "any nation that violates international norms and obligations which threaten the peace and security of the world must face the consequences of those dangerous acts."

And in a statement posted on its web site, the RJC said, "It is imperative that the U.S. preserve its ability to protect a credible military deterrent."

'WE ARE NOT INVOLVED'

The cautious approach taken by the pro-Israel groups in the days after the August 21 chemical attack in Syria was similar to that of Israel itself.

Since the rebellion against Assad began in 2011 Israel has not injected itself into Syria's civil war, a sign that however wary they are of Assad, Israeli officials also are concerned about potential chaos between warring factions in Syria if Assad were ousted.

On Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon sought to distance Israel from any U.S. decision-making. "We are not involved nor are we getting involved in Syria," he said. "We reiterate this again and again."

Several U.S. lawmakers said they had not heard from Israel on the matter of Syria.

"The Israelis will always take care of themselves. They have never asked for our military. They will never ask for anyone to defend them but themselves, and I think that Israel will be just fine," said New York Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.



headline: Kerry opens door to 'boots on ground' in Syria, then slams it shut

6:20pm EDT

Secretary of State John Kerry briefly opened the door on Tuesday to authorizing U.S. ground troops in Syria, but quickly slammed it shut and told Congress that any resolution approving military force would prohibit "boots on the ground."

The exchange during the first public hearing in Congress on possible military action in Syria highlighted the worries of many lawmakers about authorizing U.S. military strikes to punish the Syrian government for using chemical weapons on civilians.

Kerry initially told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he would prefer not to bar the use of ground troops in Syria to preserve President Barack Obama's options if Syria "imploded" or there was a threat of chemical weapons being obtained by extremists.

"I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to a president of the United States to secure our country," Kerry told the committee.

But when Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the committee, told Kerry he "didn't find that a very appropriate response regarding boots on the ground," Kerry quickly, and repeatedly, backtracked.

Kerry said he was simply "thinking out loud" and raising a hypothetical situation, but he did not want to leave the door open to sending ground troops to Syria.

"Let's shut the door now," Kerry said. "The answer is, whatever prohibition clarifies it to Congress or the American people, there will not be American boots on the ground with respect to the civil war."

The exchange came as Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited Capitol Hill as part of the administration's push to persuade Congress to back Obama's plan to launch limited strikes on Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons last month.

Obama has asked Congress, which does not return in full from summer recess until next week, to authorize action in response to what the administration says was a sarin gas attack by the Syrian government that killed more than 1,400 people, hundreds of them children, near Damascus on August 21.

Significant opposition to military force remains in Congress, where many lawmakers, including Obama's fellow Democrats, have said they are concerned the president's draft resolution is too open-ended and allow possible use of ground troops or eventual attacks on other countries.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday showed Obama has failed to convince most Americans of the need for a military strike in Syria. Some 56 percent of those surveyed said the United States should not intervene in Syria, while only 19 percent favored action, the online poll found.

The hearing was interrupted several times by shouting protesters from the anti-war group Code Pink who were escorted away by Capitol police.

NO SUPPORT FOR 'BOOTS ON THE GROUND'

"I don't think there are any of us here that are willing to support the possibility of having combat boots on the ground," Corker said.

The resolution proposed by the administration authorizes Obama to use military force as necessary to "prevent or deter the use or proliferation" to or from Syria of any weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons

One of the leading hawks on Syria in Obama's cabinet, Kerry assured lawmakers it would be easy to word a resolution on military force to reassure Congress and the public that the door in Syria was not open to ground troops.

But Kerry also urged senators not to limit U.S. authority to strike Syria to "one specific moment," saying the military had follow-on strike options should Syria's government use chemical weapons again.

Senator Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the committee, said he hoped the writing of the resolution authorizing force would be written by the end of Tuesday so the panel could vote on Wednesday.

He said the resolution would ensure it was not an open-ended engagement and "specifically not with boots on the ground, American troops on the ground."

CREDIBILITY

During their appearance, Kerry and Hagel told the committee that any military operation would be limited and specifically designed to degrade President Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons capability.

Hagel added that a failure to punish Syria for the use of chemical weapons would damage U.S. national security interests and American credibility.

"A refusal to act would undermine the credibility of America's other security commitments - including the president's commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon," he said. "The word of the United States must mean something."

As Kerry and Hagel pressed their case for limited military strikes in Syria, Obama won support for action from two top Republicans in the House of Representatives - Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

"Only the United States has the capability and the capacity to stop Assad and to warn others around the world that this type of behavior is not going to be tolerated," Boehner told reporters. "I believe that my colleagues should support this call for action."

The House, however, is seen as the more difficult chamber from which to win support. Kerry, Hagel and Dempsey are due to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday.

Among other things, the resolution sets a 60-day time limit for any engagement and bars the use of U.S. armed forces on the ground in Syria for combat operations.

Two members of the House of Representatives, Democrats Gerald Connolly and Chris van Hollen, offered their own version of the legislation, which would also prohibit U.S. "boots on the ground" and limit any engagement to 60 days.

The House must pass its own version of the authorization for the use of military force and the Senate and House versions must be reconciled before Obama can sign it.

headline: Protesting Thai rubber farmers block roads, threaten airport closure
byline: By Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Apornrath Phoonphongphiphat
6:20pm EDT

Tens of thousands of Thai rubber farmers protesting against a sharp drop in prices escalated protests across southern Thailand on Wednesday, cutting off access to large swathes of the region by blocking roads leading to tourist and commercial hubs.

Around 20,000 protesters are gathered at three main rally sites in the south watched over by a heavy police presence.

Protest leaders on Wednesday threatened to shut down Surat Thani airport, a transit point for tourists travelling to nearby islands including Pha Ngan and Samui, if their demands are not met by Wednesday.

Officials say they will not hesitate to use force if protesters move to block the airport.

"Under no circumstances will we accept it if they shut down the airport. This will ruin tourism not to mention the country's image," Deputy Prime Minister Pracha Promnok told reporters.

"If the protesters move to shut down Surat Thani airport, we will have not choice but to use force."

Farmers in the country's main southern rubber-producing region are demanding greater state support after a slowdown in demand from China and concerns over global economic growth sent prices tumbling to multi-year lows in mid-2012. China accounts for 35 percent of global rubber consumption.

Rubber farmers mainly support the opposition Democrat Party and have accused Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra of supporting rice farmers in her key constituencies through a rice-buying program, while neglecting rubber farmers in the south of the country.

The protests, now into a second week, could have a ripple effect, impacting the country's other major sources of revenue including tourism, say industry insiders.

"If the protest is prolonged there will be a definite impact on business overall and not just the rubber industry. The tourism sector, investors' confidence and national security will all be affected," Pornsilp Patcharintanakul, vice chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, told Reuters.

Thailand is the world's biggest rubber producer and exporter with around 90 percent of its output heading overseas. Thailand is forecast to produce 3.8 million metric tons of rubber in 2013.

The protests have disrupted distribution systems and delayed thousands of metric tons of Thai rubber shipments.

Protesting farmers blocked a key route leading to the country's south on Tuesday after a cabinet decision not raise the price of smoked rubber sheets from 75 baht ($2.34) per kilogram to 120 baht ($3.74)per kilogram, one of the protesters' primary demands.

Benchmark smoked rubber sheet (RSS3) was at $2.75 per kg on Wednesday, barely changed from $2.80 per kg hit in August 2012, when tumbling prices prompted government intervention that expired in May. RSS3 prices are less than half of the record high of $6.40 per kg touched in February 2011.

headline: Suriname leader says son's arrest timed to shame him
byline: By Ank Kuipers
6:20pm EDT

Suriname's president said on Tuesday the arrest of his son in Panama on charges of smuggling cocaine into the United States was timed to embarrass him as he hosted a regional summit.

President Desi Bouterse's son Dino, 40, was arraigned on Friday in a New York federal court accused of cocaine trafficking and being armed during a drug-related crime, in this case allegedly with an anti-tank rocket launcher.

Also on Friday, Bouterse was welcoming Latin American leaders to Paramaribo for a summit to mark Suriname taking the temporary leadership of the UNASUR regional trade bloc.

"It was perfect timing ... I almost want to say that I could have organized it myself," the president told reporters on Monday, when asked about the arrest.

"Luckily it did not achieve its goal" of disrupting the summit, Bouterse said, adding that other heads of state had offered him their sympathy and in some cases the services of their lawyers too, should his son need them.

"You have to put aside the issues that affect you personally, emotionally, and say, 'What is the most important thing?' The most important thing was the UNASUR meeting."

Dino Bouterse faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted of either of the two charges, which relate to events between December 2011 and August 2013.

He was convicted in Suriname in 2005 for trafficking drugs, illegal weapons and stolen luxury cars, but was later given a senior role in the government's counterterrorism unit.

The elder Bouterse was convicted in absentia in the Netherlands in 1999 for smuggling more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine to that country.

The president is a former military dictator accused of human rights violations, including the killings of 15 political opponents in December 1982. He ruled tiny Suriname from 1980 to 1987, and reclaimed power in 2010.

Since being elected in 2010, Bouterse has obtained diplomatic immunity against the charges and Interpol dropped its arrest warrant for him.

"Dino has 13 children," the president said on Tuesday. "Of course, I'm still a father, but I don't interfere in his private life. He is a big, grown-up man."

He also suggested that a U.S. attack could lead to further turmoil in conflict-ravaged Syria, where the United Nations says over 100,000 people have been killed in the country's 2-1/2-year civil war.

Ban was speaking to reporters after President Barack Obama won the backing of two top Republicans in Congress in his call for limited U.S. strikes on Syria to punish President Bashar al-Assad for his suspected use of chemical weapons against civilians.

"The use of force is lawful only when in exercise of self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations charter and/or when the Security Council approves of such action," Ban said. "That is a firm principle of the United Nations."

Obama said on Saturday he was "comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council that so far has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Assad accountable.

Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari had sharp words for the U.S. administration after a closed-door meeting between U.N. disarmament chief Angela Kane and the 37 U.N. member states that asked Ban to investigate the August 21 poison gas attack.

"Who asked Mr. Obama to be the bully of the world?" Ja'afari said. He also raised media reports suggesting rebels launched the August 21 chemical attack with the aid of Saudi Arabia.

Ja'afari said any U.S. attack "will kill innocent civilians the way they did it in Iraq in 1991 when they shelled the al-Amariyah civilian shelter and killed 500 kids and women."

Russia, backed by China, has used its veto power in the Security Council three times to block resolutions condemning Assad's government and threatening it with sanctions. Assad's government, like Russia, blames the rebels for the August 21 attack.

The United States has bypassed the United Nations in the past when the council was deadlocked, such as during the Kosovo war in 1999. At that time, Washington relied on NATO authorization for its bombing campaign, which forced Serbian troops and militia to pull out of Kosovo.

'NO IMPUNITY'

Ban also questioned whether the use of force to deter Syria or other countries from deploying chemical arms in the future could cause more harm than good.

"I take note of the argument for action to prevent future uses of chemical weapons," he said. "At the same time, we must consider the impact of any punitive measure on efforts to prevent further bloodshed and facilitate a political resolution of the conflict."

"The turmoil in Syria and across the region serves nobody," he said. "I appeal for renewed efforts by regional and international actors to convene the Geneva conference as soon as possible."

The United States and Russia announced in May that they would organize an international peace conference on Syria to revive a stalled plan agreed in June 2012 in Geneva that called for a Syrian political transition and end to the violence. But neither the government nor rebels want to negotiate and plans for a new conference appear dead, diplomats say.

Ban said that if U.N. inspectors determine that chemical weapons were used in Syria, the Security Council, which has long been deadlocked on the civil war, should overcome its differences and take action.

"The Security Council has a duty to move beyond the current stalemate and show leadership," he said. "This is a larger issue than the conflict in Syria. This is about our collective responsibility to humankind."

Ban also reiterated that the use of chemical weapons of mass destruction is an international crime of the highest order.

"If confirmed, any use of chemical weapons by anyone, under any circumstances, will be a serious violation of international law and outrageous war crime," he said.

"Almost a century ago, following the horrors of the First World War, the international community acted to ban the use of these weapons of mass destruction," Ban said. "Our common humanity compels us to ensure that chemical weapons do not become a tool of war or terror in the 21st century."

"Any perpetrators must be brought to justice," he added. "There should be no impunity."

Ban said samples and other evidence taken at the site of the attack in the suburbs of Damascus that the United States says killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children, would arrive at European laboratories on Wednesday. Ban told diplomats last week that analysis of those samples could take two weeks.

The United Nations has received at least 14 reports of possible chemical weapons use in Syria. After months of diplomatic wrangling, the U.N. experts, led by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom, arrived in Syria on August 18 with a 14-day mandate to look for evidence.

The U.N. team was initially going to look into three incidents, but its priority became the August 21 attack. The inspectors have also been looking into Syrian allegations that the rebels used chemical weapons three times last month against the Syrian army - allegations that Washington has dismissed.

Ban said Sellstrom's team would return to Syria to continue its investigation as soon as possible. The U.N. team will only determine whether chemical weapons were used, not who used them.

Assad for his suspected use of chemical weapons against civilians.

Speaking after the United Nations said two million Syrians had fled a conflict that posed the greatest threat to world peace since the Vietnam war, Obama said the United States also has a broader plan to help rebels defeat Assad's forces.

In remarks that appeared to question the legality of U.S. plans to strike Syria without U.N. backing, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the use of force is only legal when it is in self-defense or with Security Council authorization.

If U.N. inspectors confirm the use of chemical weapons in Syria, the Security Council, which has been deadlocked on the 2-1/2-year Syrian civil war, should overcome its differences and take action, Ban said.

Having startled friends and foes alike by delaying a punitive attack on Assad until Congress reconvenes and agrees, Obama met congressional leaders at the White House to urge a prompt decision and assure them it did not mean another long war like Iraq or Afghanistan.

John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor both pledged their support for military action after the meeting.

Votes are expected to be held in the Senate and House next week, with the Republican-led House presenting the tougher challenge for Obama.

The House leadership has indicated the votes will be "conscience votes," meaning they will not seek to influence members' votes on party lines. All the same, it would have been a blow to Obama if he had not secured the backing of the top two Republicans.

"I believe that my colleagues should support this call for action," Boehner told reporters.

The president said strikes aimed at punishing the use of chemical weapons would hurt Assad's forces while other U.S. action would bolster his opponents - though the White House has insisted it is not seeking "regime change."

"What we are envisioning is something limited. It is something proportional. It will degrade Assad's capabilities," Obama said. "At the same time we have a broader strategy that will allow us to upgrade the capabilities of the opposition."

Assad denies deploying poison gas that killed hundreds of civilians last month.

The Syrian opposition, which said a forensic scientist had defected to the rebel side bringing evidence of the Assad forces' use of sarin gas in March, has appealed to Western allies to send them weapons and use their air power to end a war that has killed more than 100,000 and made millions homeless.

ACCELERATING HUMAN COST

The presence in rebel ranks of Islamist militants, some of them close to al Qaeda, has made Western leaders wary, while at the same time the undoubted - and apparently accelerating - human cost of the conflict has brought pressure to intervene.

Top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi also voiced support for military strikes after meeting Obama, but he will still have to persuade some lawmakers, including Democrats, who have said they are concerned the president's draft resolution could be too open-ended.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel took the administration's message to a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, where they were pressed on whether the resolution put to Congress would explicitly rule out the use of ground troops.

Kerry said the language of the resolution was still being worked out, but it was important to leave options open for using troops in a scenario where "Syria imploded" and stockpiles of chemical weapons needed to be secured from extremists.

"I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to the president of the United States to secure our country," he said at the hearing.

When some senators objected to the idea of "boots on the ground", Kerry said the administration would work with Congress to draft a resolution that addressed concerns about ground troops.

"I know the administration has zero intention of putting troops on the ground and within the confines of this authorization, I'm confident we'd have zero problem with including some kind of prohibition there if that makes you comfortable," he told the senators.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Tuesday that Obama has failed so far to convince most Americans. Some 56 percent of those surveyed said the United States should not intervene in Syria, while only 19 percent supported action, essentially unchanged from last week.

The U.N. High Commission for Refugees said there had been a near tenfold increase over the past 12 months in the rate of refugees crossing Syria's borders into Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon - to a daily average of nearly 5,000 men, women and children.

This has pushed the total number of Syrians living abroad to more than 2 million.

That represents some 10 percent of Syria's population, the UNHCR said. With a further 4.25 million estimated to have been displaced but still resident inside the country, close to one third of all Syrians are living away from their original homes.

Comparing the figures to the peak of Afghanistan's refugee crisis two decades ago, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres, said: "Syria has become the great tragedy of this century - a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history.

"The risks for global peace and security that the present Syria crisis represents, I'm sure, are not smaller than what we have witnessed in any other crisis that we have had since the Vietnam war," said Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister.

Russia, backed by China, has used its veto power in the U.N. Security Council three times to block resolutions condemning Assad's government and threatening it with sanctions. Assad, like Russia, blames the rebels for the August 21 gas attack.

OBAMA "COMFORTABLE" WITHOUT U.N.

Obama has said he is "comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council that so far has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Assad accountable.

Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari had sharp words for Obama's administration after a closed-door meeting between U.N. disarmament chief Angela Kane and the 37 U.N. member states that asked Ban to investigate the August 21 poison gas attack.

"Who asked Mr. Obama to be the bully of the world?" Ja'afari said.

Obama was due to leave Washington on Tuesday for a G20 meeting in Russia. France said foreign ministers of some of the G20 member states will convene on the sidelines of the meeting to discuss Syria.

The conflict has divided the Middle East on sectarian lines, with Shi'ite Iran backing Assad and Washington's Sunni Arab Gulf allies supporting the mainly Sunni rebels. It has also revived Cold War-style tensions between the Western powers and Moscow.

In an interview in Le Figaro, Assad told the French newspaper: "Everybody will lose control of the situation when the powder keg blows. There is a risk of a regional war."

The influential pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC urged U.S. lawmakers to approve a resolution authorizing strikes to punish Assad. "This is a critical moment when America must also send a forceful message of resolve to Iran and Hezbollah - both of whom have provided direct and extensive military support to Assad," AIPAC said in a statement.

The rebels have been struggling to hold ground in recent months, let alone advance. According to one opposition report, government forces took the strategic northwestern town of Ariha on Tuesday, though others said the battle was not over.

While Obama's wait for Congress to return from its summer recess seems to rule out Western military action this week, Israeli forces training in the Mediterranean with the U.S. Navy set nerves on edge in Damascus with a missile test.

When Moscow raised the alarm that its forces had detected the launch of two ballistic "objects" in the Mediterranean, thoughts of a surprise strike on Syria pushed oil prices higher.

Clarification came only later when the Israeli Defence Ministry said that its troops had - at the time of the Russian alert - fired a missile that is used as a target for an anti-missile defence system during an exercise with U.S. forces.

President Barack Obama has failed so far to convince most Americans that the United States should launch a limited military strike against Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Tuesday.

Some 56 percent of those surveyed said the United States should not intervene in Syria, while only 19 percent supported action, the online poll found. Some 25 percent said they did not know what course of action the United States should take.

The findings are essentially unchanged from last week and indicated that Obama changed few minds on Saturday when he argued that Washington has the obligation to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for what the United States says was a sarin gas attack that killed more than 1,400 people, including hundreds of children, near Damascus on August 21.

The poll showed that respondents were more likely to support a strike if they were specifically asked about the chemical-weapons attack. Even then, only 29 percent said the United States should intervene, while 48 percent opposed action. Another 24 percent said they did not know.

Obama said on Saturday he had decided the United States should take military action against Syrian government targets but has asked Congress to approve the action in an acknowledgement that many Americans have little appetite for new military engagements after more than a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The U.S. public's reluctance to get involved in Syria closely mirrors public sentiment in the United Kingdom, where Parliament last week voted down a motion to support military action by the United States' closest ally.

In the United States, 65 percent of those surveyed in a separate tracking poll agreed with a statement that said "the problems of Syria are none of our business." In the United Kingdom, a parallel poll by Ipsos found that 58 percent agreed with that statement.

Similarly, only 29 percent support the Obama administration's decision to arm anti-government rebels in Syria, while 49 percent oppose that move. Another 21 percent said they didn't know whether they agreed or disagreed with that strategy.

The online poll of 1,195 adult Americans was conducted between August 30 and September 3. It has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.

A series of car bombs exploded across the Iraqi capital on Tuesday, killing nearly 60 people in predominantly Shi'ite districts, police and medics said.

It was not immediately clear who had carried out the attacks, which appeared coordinated, but Sunni Islamist militants, including an al Qaeda affiliate, have been striking with a ferocity not seen in years.

More than two years of civil war in neighboring Syria have aggravated deep-rooted sectarian divisions in Iraq, fraying an uneasy government coalition of Shi'ite, Sunni and ethnic Kurdish factions.

Tuesday's deadliest single blast took place in Baghdad's northern Talbiya neighborhood, where a car bomb in a busy street killed nine people.

In the Hussainiya district on the northern outskirts of the capital, two car bombs exploded in quick succession, killing ten.

"I saw a fireball and a huge cloud of smoke. We couldn't approach immediately fearing a second bomb, but we could hear the screams of people asking for help," said Ali Jameel, a policeman in a patrol stationed in Hussainiya.

"A minute later a second blast happened nearby. Bodies were lying on the ground and some of the wounded were crawling to distance themselves from the blaze, leaving a trail of blood behind them".

About 800 Iraqis were killed in August, according to the United Nations, with more than a third of the deadly attacks happening in Baghdad.

The bloodshed, 18 months after U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq, has stirred concerns about a return to the sectarian slaughter of 2006-07, when the monthly death toll sometimes topped 3,000.

Earlier on Tuesday, gunmen stormed the house of a Sunni, pro-government militia member in southern Baghdad and beheaded him, along with his wife and three children, police and medics said.

Separately, four unidentified bodies were found in different places in Baghdad. All of the victims had been handcuffed, blindfolded and killed.

Suriname's president said on Tuesday the arrest of his son in Panama on charges of smuggling cocaine into the United States was timed to embarrass him as he hosted a regional summit.

President Desi Bouterse's son Dino, 40, was arraigned on Friday in a New York federal court accused of cocaine trafficking and being armed during a drug-related crime, in this case allegedly with an anti-tank rocket launcher.

Also on Friday, Bouterse was welcoming Latin American leaders to Paramaribo for a summit to mark Suriname taking the temporary leadership of the UNASUR regional trade bloc.

"It was perfect timing ... I almost want to say that I could have organized it myself," the president told reporters on Monday, when asked about the arrest.

"Luckily it did not achieve its goal" of disrupting the summit, Bouterse said, adding that other heads of state had offered him their sympathy and in some cases the services of their lawyers too, should his son need them.

"You have to put aside the issues that affect you personally, emotionally, and say, 'What is the most important thing?' The most important thing was the UNASUR meeting."

Dino Bouterse faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted of either of the two charges, which relate to events between December 2011 and August 2013.

He was convicted in Suriname in 2005 for trafficking drugs, illegal weapons and stolen luxury cars, but was later given a senior role in the government's counterterrorism unit.

He was also convicted in absentia in the Netherlands in 1999 for smuggling more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine to that country.

The elder Bouterse is a former military dictator accused of human rights violations, including the killings of 15 political opponents in December 1982. He ruled tiny Suriname from 1980 to 1987, and reclaimed power in 2010.

Since being elected in 2010, Bouterse has obtained diplomatic immunity against the charges and Interpol dropped its arrest warrant for him.

"Dino has 13 children," the president said on Tuesday. "Of course, I'm still a father, but I don't interfere in his private life. He is a big, grown-up man."

headline: Erdogan closer to Turkish presidency with allies' public backing
byline: By Jonathon Burch

Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, accused of authoritarian rule at demonstrations in June, has taken a step towards what he hopes will be a stronger executive presidency after two senior politicians publicly backed him for the post.

With less than a year to the vote, speculation has been mounting over what role Erdogan and Abdullah Gul, who occupies the current largely figurehead presidential post, will play in Turkey's first popular presidential election in 2014.

The two were founding members of the ruling AK Party (AKP) in 2001 and longtime allies. Their relations have appeared at times strained over the last year, not least over a police crackdown on anti-government demonstrations this Summer.

"If our prime minister wants to run, then we will say with no hesitation, 'Our friend Tayyip Erdogan is our candidate', the matter will be finished," Bulent Arinc, a deputy prime minister and another AKP co-founder, told Turkey's Aksiyon magazine.

"If the prime minister wishes this, then it is also natural for it to happen. I don't think Abdullah Gul would feel differently towards such a wish," Arinc said.

Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for a decade, cannot run again as prime minister in 2015 according to AKP rules, and had been long expected to stand for a newly-created executive presidency, although his plans to establish such an enhanced role have stalled.

Gul, who has emerged as a more popular presidential candidate in opinion polls, is allowed to run for a second term, though he has not publicly expressed any intention to do so.

Huseyin Celik, deputy chairman and spokesman for the AKP, said it was in the country's best interests for Erdogan to become president next year and sought to play down any rift.

"The friendship between our prime minister and our president runs very deep. It is a friendship that has passed many tests. When our prime minister decides to become a candidate, I don't think Mr. Gul will say, 'I'll run too'," Celik told the Kral FM radio station in an interview.

Erdogan's brash and stern nature often stands in contrast to Gul's more moderate and soft-spoken approach, a distinction most noticeable in their stances on Syria and Egypt.

While any open confrontation between Erdogan and Gul is broadly seen as unlikely, differences between the two men have become increasingly apparent.

In perhaps his most open display of irritation last October, Erdogan hit out at what he called "double-headed" government, a thinly-veiled reference to the presidency, after Gul remarked on the police's heavy handling of a banned rally in Ankara.

Gul dismissed the comments, saying "the constitution and laws clearly state our authority, duty and responsibilities".

Differences have also surfaced more recently. Erdogan repeatedly dismissed demonstrators who took part in widespread anti-government protests this summer as "riff-raff", while Gul was more conciliatory and called for dialogue.

What happens at the ballot box next year will also depend on whether Erdogan is able to push through a new constitution, including provisions for an executive presidency, a move seen as less and less likely as the election cycle nears.

Efforts to draft a new charter have all but stalled due to disagreements among the main four political parties, not leastly over the question of a more powerful presidency.

Opponents fear such a position would further consolidate Erdogan's grip without a parliament strong enough to rein him in. The current presidency is largely ceremonial, though the president must approve laws passed by parliament and make important appointments in the judiciary and education.



headline: Obama invites Russian rights activists to meeting alongside G20 summit

6:20pm EDT

U.S. President Barack Obama invited Russian human rights activists to meet him later this week, their groups said on Tuesday, a few weeks after snubbing Russian President Vladimir Putin amid spiraling disputes over human rights and security.

Obama, who will meet the activists in St Petersburg on the fringes of the September 5-6 summit of G20 leaders, last month pulled out of talks with Putin in a sign of the worst tensions between Moscow and Washington since the end of the Cold War.

The meeting with activists will underline U.S. displeasure over the state of human rights in Russia and new laws that critics of the Kremlin say clamp down on dissent, violate gay rights and restrain non-governmental organizations.

The meeting will take place on Thursday, according to Russian activists.

"Judging by the list of participants, we will talk about gay rights and the situation of non-governmental organizations in Russia," said Pavel Chikov of the legal advocacy rights Agora, at the forefront of accusations that Putin has been cracking down on dissent since he returned to the presidency last year.

The U.S. Embassy in Moscow had no immediate comment. The Kremlin said earlier that it was "disappointed" at Obama's decision not to meet Putin separately.

Veteran activists Svetlana Gannushkina and Lyudmila Alexeyeva both said they would attend the meeting with Obama but Alexeyeva said she felt it was more about U.S. dissatisfaction with Putin than interest in Russia's human rights situation.

"POLITICS"

"This is politics, this is because of Snowden and what else," she said. U.S. officials visiting Russia regularly meet human rights representatives.

Obama dropped the bilateral summit with Putin planned in Moscow after Russia granted asylum to Edward Snowden, an ex-intelligence contractor wanted by Washington over leaks of classified files on U.S. government surveillance activities.

Relations between Moscow and Washington have also been strained by rows over Syria.

Also invited to the meeting with Obama was St Petersburg's gay rights group Vykhod, or "Coming Out", which staged protests against a law Putin signed earlier this year banning "gay propaganda" among minors. The law has been widely criticized in the West as discriminatory.

The activists also said they hoped to bring up with Obama a new law on non-governmental organizations that forces those who receive foreign funding to register as "foreign agents", a term that carries Cold War overtones of treason.

Kremlin critics at home point to the law as part of an intensifying tightening of the screws orchestrated by Putin to strengthen his grip on power following the largest wave of street protests against his 13-year rule in 2011 and 2012.

The United States increased the friction last year when it adopted a blacklist of unwelcome Russian state officials whom it deemed rights violators, triggering an angry reaction from Moscow and a subsequent tit-for-tat move.

Among other laws approved by Putin in recent months and denounced by critics as repressive is a ban on Americans adopting Russian orphans.



headline: Colombia's FARC talks at 'critical' stage, government negotiator says
byline: By Helen Murphy
6:20pm EDT

Colombia's peace talks with Marxist FARC rebels have reached a "critical" stage, with discussions over the next couple of months a key gauge of whether an end to five decades of war is likely or not, government negotiator Sergio Jaramillo said on Tuesday.

The government has spent almost 10 months working through a difficult peace agenda in Cuba with representatives of the FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. While some progress has been made, talks have been painstakingly slow and most now see the hoped-for year-end deadline as unlikely.

"We are currently in a critical moment of negotiations, I think that in the next months we will know if this is going to work or not because we are beginning on essential issues," Jaramillo, one of the six-man government negotiating team, said during an address in congress.

President Juan Manuel Santos said from the very beginning he did not want the talks to drag on indefinitely, putting a November limit on completion. He has since loosened the target date to year-end or some months later.

Unused to seeing rebel leaders taking center stage and making televised political statements and demands on the government, Colombians have grown impatient over the last few months at the pace of talks.

Meanwhile, the rebels have continued to kill scores of soldiers and attack economic infrastructure, putting additional pressure on Santos to clinch a deal.

The center-right president took a huge risk seeking peace after numerous attempts by previous governments ended in failure and bolstered the group's fighting force. The talks have already dominated his agenda and threaten to overwhelm campaigning for next year's presidential election.

"Let's see how we can accelerate these conversations, time is short, people want peace but demand that we advance more quickly," said Santos during the inauguration of a military hospital in Bogota.

The official agenda includes rebel participation in politics, an end to the conflict, how to eliminate the drug trade, reparations for victims and agrarian reform - on which the two sides have reached partial accord.

Government negotiators have said it could take as long as a decade to implement the accords.

POPULAR VOTE

The war, which began in 1964 and led to as many as 200,000 deaths, has pit the FARC and a smaller rebel group, the ELN, against government troops and illegal paramilitary death squads.

The FARC has sought to overthrow a dozen governments since it began as an agrarian struggle against rural inequality. Even while it has been severely weakened in the past 10 years by a heavy U.S.-backed offensive, the leftist guerrilla movement remains a formidable threat to the government and civilian population.

Santos wants any agreement reached in Havana to be ratified by popular vote. If the voters do not like the way peace is achieved and how it would impact the nation, the accords would be moot, Santos has said.

Europe drive could cause it to lose for good its control over the breakaway territory of Transdniestria and lead to a more costly energy relationship with Russia, its main supplier of gas.

Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian deputy prime minister, stepped up pressure on Moldova, a former Soviet republic and one of Europe's poorest states, as Moscow also continued to bear down on Ukraine over its European integration plans.

Moldova, following the path of neighboring Ukraine, expects to initial association and free trade agreements with the European Union at a November summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, marking a clear break with its Soviet past.

In comments to journalists late on Monday after talks with Moldovan Prime Minister Iurie Leanca, Rogozin likened Moldova to a locomotive on a perilous course of twists and turns that could cause it to lose some of its carriages - an allusion to its rebel enclave of Transdniestria.

In a barbed reminder to Moldova of its total reliance on gas imports from Russia, he also said: "Energy supplies are important in the run-up to winter. I hope you won't freeze."

The former Soviet republic of 3.5 million people is heavily in debt to Moscow for cheap gas imports that help keep its economy afloat.

The separatist, mainly Russian-speaking, region of Transdniestria broke with Moldova's central government after a short war in 1992 and sees Moscow as its patron. But its status remains undecided, despite years of international talks.

In further comments, Rogozin said Moldova's policy of European integration represented a threat for any lasting settlement on Transdniestria.

"People in Transdniestria are very alarmed at Moldova's plans, particularly those linked to entering a free trade zone with the EU," he said speaking at a pro-Russia forum in Chisinau.

Rogozin, a former Russian ambassador to NATO, warned the Moldovan leadership that Europe was "not a place for the weak".

"After my meetings, I have the impression that certain Chisinau officials assume that after signing agreements with the EU the whole of Moldova will be in jam or honey. But this signing will only mean for Moldova a carrot to entice it somewhere or other," he said.

Rogozin's strong words to Moldova came after similar Kremlin warnings to Ukraine which also wants to tie up association and free trade deals with the EU in Vilnius.

In a warning shot to Ukraine last month, Russia conducted extra customs checks on Ukrainian imports over several days and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke of possible "protective" measures by Moscow and its customs union allies Belarus and Kazakhstan.

Ukraine says Russia will remain a strategic partner even after agreements with the EU. President Viktor Yanukovich told parliament on Tuesday to draw up draft legislation to prepare the country for the agreements to be signed and provide for "success" in Vilnius.

graft agency.

The conviction of two-star police general Djoko Susilo, who amassed a fortune worth $18 million while serving as Indonesia's top traffic policeman, is the first of an active senior police officer by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) and could pave the way for a broad campaign against police corruption.

The police are viewed as one of the most corrupt institutions in Indonesia and cleaning up a culture of graft is seen as critical to improving the country's image with investors.

"This is KPK's biggest case that has been resolved so far in regards to the total value of assets," Bambang Widjojanto, the commission's deputy head, told reporters after the verdict.

"This is the first, and maybe this is not going to be the last."

Former National Traffic Police deputy Didik Purnomo has also been charged in the case but has yet to go on trial.

Susilo was found guilty of accepting kickbacks in the awarding of a contract for driving simulators while he was head of the National Police Traffic Corps.

Susilo, who denied wrongdoing, planned to appeal, his lawyer told the court.

While foreign investment pours into the resource-rich country, there is growing concern that rampant corruption and an incompetent bureaucracy could throttle growth and begin to scare off investment.

A stream of high-profile graft cases, the most recent being one involving the head of the energy regulator, has tarnished President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's final term.

During KPK's investigation of Susilo, officials found that he had amassed $18 million worth of assets including land, cars and mansions, which he tried to hide under the names of his three wives.



headline: Hamas says Egyptian military building buffer zone with Gaza
byline: By Nidal al-Mughrabi
6:20pm EDT

Egyptian security forces have destroyed some 20 houses along the border with Gaza, local residents said on Tuesday, in what the Palestinian enclave's Islamist Hamas rulers fear is an effort to build a buffer zone to isolate them.

Egypt's military stepped up a campaign against Islamist militants in the Sinai Peninsula, bordering Gaza, after deposing Islamist president Mohamed Mursi following mass unrest, and has accused Gaza Palestinians of supporting the militants.

The crackdown, before and after Mursi's ouster, has included closures of tunnels from Gaza the military believes have been used to move weapons, gunmen and goods across the border.

Now, residents on the Egyptian side of the border say, the armed forces have also begun to tear down homes, apparently suspecting they are being used to hide tunnel entrances or provide cover for other militant activity.

The Egyptian crackdown is reminiscent of the demolitions that Israel, citing security concerns, used to carry out on the Palestinian side of the Egyptian border before it pulled troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005.

"We reject any concept of building a buffer zone. Buffer zones should not be built between brothers and between friendly countries," said Ehab al-Ghsain, spokesman for the Hamas government in Gaza.

An Egyptian army source confirmed the military had intensified its campaign to close tunnels but said he knew of no instructions to put a buffer zone in place.

Residents on the Egyptian side of the border said that at least 20 homes had been torn down.

One resident, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters by telephone that he counted 17 destroyed houses, all located within 700 meters (yards) of the frontier.

"The Egyptian army orders people to evacuate their houses and then they knock them down, leaving residents to look for a place to stay, with relatives or friends," he said.

On the Hamas-controlled side of the border, calls can be heard from loudspeakers on mosques across the frontier urging residents to confront the Egyptian military during demolitions.

Egyptian army officials have accused Hamas, which felt strengthened by Islamist rule in Cairo, of interfering in Egyptian affairs and suggested that Palestinians might be helping Islamist militants in Sinai.

This has been denied by Hamas, which began as a 1980s spin-off from Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood, won a Palestinian election in 2006 and seized control of Gaza from forces loyal to Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007.

BORDER CROSSING

Hamas said Egyptian authorities were continuing to limit to 250 the number of Palestinians allowed to cross daily into Egypt from Gaza. Some 1,200 people a day used to pass through the Rafah border terminal before Mursi's removal in July.

"Gaza will never be a danger to Egypt and our battle and struggle will always remain against the Israeli occupation in defense of Palestine and the dignity of Arab and Muslim nation," Hamas said in a statement on Tuesday.

Tunnel owners have said that only a few of the 1,200 passages running under the border are still operational.

Since the Hamas takeover of Gaza and the tightening of Israel's blockade, the tunnels have been a crucial conduit for consumer goods into the enclave. Hamas Economy Minister Ala al-Rafati said their closure had cost the economy of the widely impoverished Gaza Strip at least $230 million in July alone.

In 2010, Israel began easing its economic restrictions and allowing more products into Gaza through its border crossings, though Palestinians say limitations should be lifted completely.

Assad.

"We will strike with all our might," says U.S. President Barack Obama, depicted in a cartoon in Saudi newspaper Alsharq.

But when?

Wearing a dreamy smile, Obama replies: "In a day, a week, a month, a year, 10 years - or however many years you can count."

The implicit mockery reflects a suspicion among both friends and foes of Washington in the Middle East that Obama's move to refer military action to Congress is a sure sign of weakness - and one that places unprecedented strains on the credibility of his administration in its standoff with Syria and Iran.

Obama's abrupt decision on Saturday to halt plans to punish Assad for using poison gas and instead wait for congressional approval momentarily united a fractious region in astonishment.

Reflecting a widespread view voiced in interviews by Reuters across the region, Algeria's El Watan newspaper said Assad's foes seemed riven with doubt in their confrontation with the embattled Syrian leader, fearing intervention would be a "flop".

At the same time, sentiment across the Middle East often differentiates between Obama's deliberative - some critics say hesitant - leadership style, and an abiding perception of the United States as a superpower bent on policing the region on behalf of its friend Israel and of oil-rich Gulf Arab allies.

OBAMA'S "RETREAT"

Used to the uncompromising approach of his predecessor, George W. Bush, who proclaimed "You are either with us or you are with the terrorists" in the wake of the 9/11 attacks of 2001 and went on to invade Iraq in 2003, many Arabs tend to see Obama's apparent distaste for war as unusual, even exceptional.

Wathiq al-Hashimi of the Iraqi Group for Strategic Studies, said Arabs associated wars in the region with Republicans rather than Obama's Democrats; the end of the Cold War gave Washington scope to attack former proteges of Moscow, notably in Iraq, in conflicts launched by Bush and by his father a decade earlier.

At the same time, Hashimi said, Obama's move was confusing for many in the region and represented "a retreat".

Mohammed Yassin, a 45-year-old Palestinian in Gaza said Obama did not look like the "tough guy Bush was". Employing an Arab nickname for Obama, derived from his Kenyan father's name, Yassin said, smiling: "Abu Hussein has no balls."

Assad deserved punishment, but not from foreigners, he said.

"There's a saying in Syria: a barking dog never bites," said Adnan Diab, a Syrian teacher living in Lebanon. "That's what we expect ... God willing, nothing will happen."

In Istanbul, Mustafa Toprak, a 37-year-old salesman, sucking on a water pipe at a cafĂŠ on the shores of the Bosphorus, said the hold-up made Obama look both weak and insincere.

In downtown Cairo, Mohsin Ahmad El-Tayeb, 38, selling bags on the street, described Obama as "wavering" and holding two or three opinions at once: "He definitely won't strike Syria now."

That is precisely the outcome Assad's enemies fear.

A number of Syrian opposition figures contacted by Reuters said they remained confident Obama would eventually carry out a strike on Assad's forces, possibly a substantial one.

Speaking from Berlin, veteran Syrian opposition campaigner Fawaz Tello said it would be bizarre if Obama had assembled all his military might just to give Assad "a slap on the wrist".

Ayman Abdel Nour, a former university friend and adviser to Assad who left Syria in 2007, said that if there was a strike that went beyond the cosmetic, some top officers would defect.

Yet among allies of the opposition, doubts persist.

SAUDI DISAPPOINTMENT

In Saudi Arabia, a foe of Assad which has continued to urge international intervention since Obama's decision to delay a strike, there was no response from two officials contacted for comment. But analysts say that in private there was concern.

Abdulaziz al Sager, chairman of the Gulf Research Centre, said Obama's decision "reflects a lack of resolve", something he said had been evident since the beginning of the Syrian crisis:

"There is a deep sense of disappointment in the Gulf region with the president's decision to seek the Congress's approval."

For their part, senior Obama administration officials are arguing that Obama's move to consult Congress should be seen as one that would buttress his decision and America's credibility abroad - assuming Congress backs the president.

They warn it would undermine the credibility of the United States in the Middle East and around the world if Congress does not approve his deployment of military force in Syria.

Anthony Cordesman of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote that Obama had to show real leadership, "not overreaction, sudden reversal and uncertainty".

A No vote in Congress would be a "near disaster", the military scholar wrote. U.S. influence in the Middle East would be seriously undermined and the United States would still have no meaningful strategy for the Syrian war, he added.

Echoing Cordesman's concern, Yezigh Sayigh of the Carnegie Middle East think tank in Beirut said that the absence of a Syria policy was why Obama appeared to be "dithering", and this arguably reflected Washington's wider struggle to engage with the region since the Arab uprisings of early 2011.

IRANIAN "GLEE"

Assad's ally, Iran, involved in its own standoff with major powers over its nuclear program, has been circumspect.

But lawmaker Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Tehran parliament's foreign affairs committee, was quoted as saying he hoped Congress would vote against an attack - in line with what he said were the wishes of the U.S. people.

Similarly, more diplomacy is what Tehran hopes Washington will continue to practice toward Iran, which denies Western accusations it is trying to develop nuclear weapons.

A diplomat based in Tehran said the Iranian government had seen Obama's decision as U.S. weakness. The first reaction from Iranian officials was one of "glee", the diplomat said.

Israelis see in the Syria showdown a test of the Americans' ability to make good on a pledge to deny Iran the means to make a nuclear bomb through military force if diplomacy fails.

In Israel, which sees Iran's program as a direct threat, authorities have been polite in public about the hold-up in U.S. Syria preparations. But privately there may be reservations.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to whom Obama last year promised that he would "always have Israel's back", ordered his ministers not to discuss Syria openly. But this was ignored by ultra-nationalist economy minister Naftali Bennett.

"More than 1,000 civilians, many of them babies and children, were murdered by a dark regime using poison gas. And the world hesitates," Bennett wrote on Facebook.

"At the moment of truth, we will depend only on ourselves."

Jerusalem resident Jay Shapiro, his white hair covered by a red baseball cap, recalled a century-old adage about it being U.S. foreign policy to speak softly and carry a big stick:

"President Obama has the opposite policy. He speaks loudly and carries no stick," Shapiro said. "He doesn't have our back. He doesn't even have America's back."

left.

The chancellor, whose bid for a third term on September 22 is a close contest despite her popularity, said Peer Steinbrueck would ruin her progress on cutting unemployment and cementing economic recovery if his Social Democrats (SPD) came to power.

"These are all successes of our citizens, employers and entrepreneurs - but also the result of clever political leadership," 59-year-old Merkel told the Bundestag lower house of parliament in a debate on 'The Situation in Germany'.

Seizing on the SPD and Greens' economic ideas as a weapon for the final stage of the campaign, she said higher taxes on top incomes, wealth and inheritance would "put jobs at risk and demotivate the Mittelstand", referring to the family-owned firms that form the backbone of Europe's biggest economy.

"What citizens must decide on September 22 is nothing more and nothing less than whether we continue on the path of success or see gross mistakes that will destroy our success," she said.

Steinbrueck, a 66-year-old former finance minister, has a reputation for arrogance which contrasts with the chancellor's modest, understated style - part of her enduring appeal to the German public even after eight years in office.

But he SPD and its Green allies are only a few points behind Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), in most opinion polls, which might explain her more assertive tone in Tuesday's parliamentary debate.

BURNING BRIDGES

Merkel needs her junior coalition partner, the struggling Free Democrats (FDP), to clear the 5 percent threshold for the Bundestag so that she can avoid being forced into a repeat of her conservatives' 2005-2009 'grand coalition' with the SPD.

The SPD is even keener to avoid this as the last coalition with Merkel eroded its grassroots support. Steinbrueck served in that coalition and has vowed never to join another Merkel-led cabinet, meaning his fate is sealed if the SPD is defeated.

Fresh from a close-fought TV debate with Merkel on Sunday, when the SPD's gaffe-prone candidate performed better than expected, Steinbrueck used his sharp tongue to great effect in a Bundestag debate that turned into a second round of that duel.

"Frau Merkel, the most important two words you used in your speech were 'we will, we will, we will' - raising the question: who has been in government for the last four years in Germany?" he said, branding her policies "labels on empty bottles".

Steinbrueck said Germany's last meaningful economic reforms came a decade ago under the last SPD chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder. Despite record low unemployment of 6.8 percent, he cited data showing that seven million people earn less than the 8.5 euros per hour the SPD would introduce as the minimum wage.

He rebuked Merkel for calling the SPD "unreliable" on Europe and reminded her that his party had supported all parliamentary votes on the euro crisis, even when she was short of a majority.

"You are burning bridges with such comments," he said.



headline: Romania opens inquiry against communist gulag chief
byline: By Radu Marinas
6:20pm EDT

Romania launched a criminal inquiry on Tuesday against a communist jail commander from the 1960s who is accused of crimes against humanity, as the country confronts its Stalinist past.

Historians say about half a million Romanians including priests, teachers and doctors were jailed as political prisoners after World War Two, and that about a fifth died in prisons such as Ramnicu Sarat.

Alexandru Visinescu, 88, was chief of Ramnicu Sarat in 1956-1963. Prosecutors accuse him of subjecting prisoners to beatings and starvation, as well as refusing them health treatment and heating.

The retired Lieutenant-Colonel has said he was "only following orders and doing his job".

Visinescu is charged with genocide - which is listed under crimes against humanity in the Romanian penal code and includes "subjecting members of a national, ethnic, religious or racial group to conditions that are meant to physically destroy them".

It is the first such genocide inquiry since the execution on similar charges of former communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena in 1989.

Romania overthrew communist rule in a bloody revolution but has yet to convict a single communist-era prison commander as the European Union's second poorest state has been reluctant to face its past.

"We began an inquiry under charges of crimes of genocide. From his position, Visinescu, Alexandru, subjected the collectivity represented by political prisoners to conditions and treatment likely to trigger their physical destruction," Romania's prosecuting office said in a statement.

Visinescu attended prosecuting hearings for about one hour on Tuesday. He declined to make any statements to the media and left the building in a taxi.

Earlier this year, he told a local television station he was "only following orders and doing his job" and that he had no regrets from his time as prison commander and blamed the country's leadership of those years.

Romania still bears the scars of Ceausescu's repressive rule and his predecessor Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.

Many communist-era officials still hold prominent positions, continuing to wield influence on political policy and in the business world, even though current President Traian Basescu condemned crimes committed during that era in a 2006 speech.

The Institute for the Investigation of the Communist Crimes and the Romanian Exile Memory unearthed Visinescu's case based on former convicts' testimonies and former secret police archives. It said Visinescu was among a group of 35 prison officials aged 81-99 who committed crimes.

The institute said during Visinescu's time in charge of Ramnicu Sarat, there were 5 deaths which could be documented, including that of opposition party leader Ion Mihalache.

Romania opened Ceausescu's execution site to the public on Tuesday. The former military army barracks is in the city of Targoviste, where he was shot dead by a firing squad on Christmas Day, 1989.



headline: Sri Lanka sees new threats of terrorism, Muslim extremism
byline: By Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal
6:20pm EDT

Sri Lanka, under heavy pressure to end human rights abuses four years after the end of a brutal civil war with Tamil Tiger rebels, said on Tuesday it faced a new threat of terrorism and Muslim extremism.

The comments came three days after U.N. Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay said people were still suffering amid signs the country was becoming more authoritarian.

Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, younger brother of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, said groups linked to the Liberation of Tamil Tiger rebels had been trying to undermine government reconciliation and development efforts.

"These include winning of international opinion for the separatist cause... and pushing for the resumption of conflict through reorganizing of local militant activities in Sri Lanka," Rajapaksa told a defense seminar.

Rajapaksa said Pillay's visit was mostly due to pro-rebel linked groups. He also said there had also been Muslim extremist elements found in transit in Sri Lanka.

"The possibility that such extremist elements may try to promote Muslim extremism in Sri Lanka is a cause for concern," he said.

Rajapaksa said Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka faced possible threats from groups involved in previous insurgencies, trying to mobilize people to once again take up extreme leftwing causes.

The Tamils, mostly Hindu with some Christians, are the largest minority in Sri Lanka, followed by Muslims.

Marxist rebels of the Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna (JVP), or People's Liberation Front, launched the second phase of an insurrection in the late 1980s.

Security forces responded ruthlessly and many rebels were killed or disappeared. The JVP later transformed itself from a rebel group into a political party.

More recently, there has been increasing violence against Muslims, mirroring events in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.

The government battled separatist Tamil guerrillas from 1983 to 2009. Tens of thousands of civilians were killed in the final months of the war, according to a UN report, as government troops advanced on the rebels' last stronghold and many hundreds of people, most of them Tamils, simply disappeared.

The United Nations has urged Sri Lanka to carry out credible investigations into the killings and disappearances.

Pillay, after ending her controversial visit, raised concerns about the degree to which the military has been involved with civilian activities and said she was surprised at the government downplaying violence against religious minorities, including attacks on churches and mosques.

immigration party.

Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg guided Norway through a global downturn with little more than a scratch. But growth is slowing, his record on health care is mixed and critics accuse him of squandering the oil revenues that have shielded Norway.

Opinion polls suggest Conservative leader Erna Solberg, an admirer of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, would need the support of smaller parties, raising the prospect that the populist Progress Party, which wants to restrict immigration, could hold the balance of power.

While Progress may get fewer votes than four years ago, it will likely enter government for the first time, marking another big step for populist anti-immigration parties after gains in Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Progress itself however has moderated its tone and could make more concessions to enter government.

"I don't think the government is the reason everything went so well for Norway through Europe's crisis," Daniel Sundkvist, a nurse from Oslo said.

"I'm not sure things will improve when others are in charge, but I am convinced that we have to get rid of the government," Sundkvist, 36, added. "I've seen what they did to health care over the past eight years and they've made it worse, both for the patients and also for those who work in it."

Polls give Stoltenberg's Labour around 30 percent, making it the biggest single party. But opposition parties, all of whom campaign on unseating the government, are on course for at least a 10-seat majority in parliament.

"The government has been in majority for eight years; the cost of rule is taking its toll and people want change," Sveinung Arnesen, a political analyst at the UNI Rokkan Centre for Social Research said.

MINORITY GOVERNMENT?

The biggest risk to a center-right coalition is the Progress Party, which was seen by some as too radical for government and once had among its members Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in 2011 in a gun and bomb attack targeting Labour.

The party has toned down its image. But some of its more radical stances on immigration and spending may be too much to swallow for the small Christian Democrats and Liberals, whose vote may be needed for a majority.

"They are not a far-right party. They are a populist right party and with some similarities with other populist and populist radical parties in Europe," Elisabeth Ivarsflaten, a political scientist at the University of Bergen said.

"But they seem really intent on joining the government so they'll probably compromise on a lot of issues," she added.

Working with Progress on immigration could be hard after the party unveiled plans to cut immigration from outside the EU by half and reduce the number of asylum seekers it accepts.

Although net immigration is high, swelling Norway's population by 1 percent each year, unemployment is below 3 percent and companies desperately need fresh workers.

Bringing all four disparate opposition parties into a coalition may be too hard, raising the prospect that Solberg would rule in a minority government - not unusual in Norway due in part to laws that do not allow for early elections.

IRON ERNA

Solberg, 52, nicknamed "Iron Erna" for her tough stances when she served in cabinet between 2001 and 2005, will rely on her skill to keep Progress in check, yielding on a few issues like tax cuts and infrastructure spending and perhaps making a symbolic gesture on immigration.

Solberg seems set to become prime minister on her third attempt after steering her party closer to the center.

Breaking with Conservative tradition, she did not focus her campaign on issues like tax cuts and easing regulation, instead making health care, road building and education her primary topics.

"We have not used the best time we have experienced in the economy in Norway's history to invest in the future," she said. "Our economy stands on one leg, the oil sector. What happens if oil prices fall? What will happen after the oil age is over?"

Although Norway has outperformed Europe for the past several years, its economy is slowing and Stoltenberg, seen as a top economic manager, disturbed international investors this year when he unveiled Norway's first oil tax hike in decades.

Solberg has promised to cut taxes, sell down stakes in firms like Telenor and Statoil, reduce the size of government and ease business regulation. She campaigns on boosting health and infrastructure spending without inflating the budget.

Fiscal responsibility may be her biggest issue. The Progress Party is seen as a keen spender, hoping to invest some of the $750 billion, or $150,000 per man, woman and child that Norway has saved up from oil revenues on infrastructure.

Solberg may give the party the finance ministry, forcing it to hold back on spending or risk looking irresponsible.

"Progress is really keen on getting into power, they've been preparing for a long time for this so they really want to look responsible," Arnesen said.



headline: Ambiguous religion policy backfires on Tunisia's ruling Islamists

Muslims could no longer enter the building, not even just its outside gallery overlooking the busy souk.

"You can only come in if you declare, 'There is no god but God and Mohammad is God's messenger'," he said - effectively making conversion to Islam the new admission ticket to a monument that used to welcome non-Muslim visitors.

Hardline views like these have spread through Tunisia in the past two years as radical Muslims seized control of about a fifth of all mosques, attacked westernized liberals and tried to impose their puritan ideas on one of the most secular Arab societies.

The governing party Ennahda, which formally advocates a democratic form of Islamism, long treated the radicals mildly, seeing them as informal allies in reclaiming Islam's place in the small North African country.

But two assassinations of secular politicians this year widely blamed on militant Islamists alienated many Tunisians and united the secular opposition parties, powerful trade unions and other civil society groups against Ennahda.

"Ennahda now realizes the Salafis are very unpopular and it has to accept the opposition demand for new elections," said Alaya Allani, a historian of Islamism at Manouba University near Tunis. "It will not be the majority party after the next polls."

Geoffrey Howard, North Africa analyst at the Control Risks consultancy, said Ennahda was now far below the 37 percent it polled in Tunisia's first democratic election in 2011. "The party has been severely damaged by the latest crisis."

RELIGIOUS INDIGESTION

Tunisia was the first of the "Arab Spring" countries to overthrow its autocratic leader, president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, in January 2011 and the first to elect an Islamist-led government that October.

As in Egypt, which voted the Muslim Brotherhood into power the following year, freedom brought a wave of local radicals and foreign imams who preached a hardline Islam inspired by Saudi Wahhabism and other literalist schools from the Gulf.

Radicals took over around 1,000 of Tunisia's 5,000 mosques, which are normally run by the Religious Affairs Ministry, and turned them from quiet places of prayer to platforms to call for jihad and sharia (Islamic law).

Violent Salafi groups rioted over an art show they deemed blasphemous, demonstrated at Manouba University to demand that women students wear full face veils and patrolled some districts to pressure residents into following their puritan Islam.

In the assembly writing Tunisia's new constitution, Ennahda members have argued for it to include sharia, annul the gender equality brought in under previous secular rulers and drop references to international human rights conventions.

As the respected jurist Yadh Ben Achour put it in August 2012: "Religion has invaded the social and political debate to such an extent that we are starting to get indigestion ... The country's real problems have been pushed aside or put off indefinitely."

Tunisia is suffering from a severe fiscal crisis and high unemployment - other major factors in recent popular unrest.

AMBIGUOUS POLICY

Religious Affairs Minister Noureddine Khadmi said his staff have been able over the past year to roll back the number of Salafi mosques through persuasion, pressure and legal action.

"Now there are fewer than 100," he told Reuters in an interview. "In about 50 cases, we have called on the Justice Ministry to step in and resolve the issue."

In the case of the 1,300-year-old Zitouna, the imam now controlling it is not a Salafi but a staunch conservative who rejects state control over the famed mosque.

Khadmi said the government sought to "correct the religious landscape" after five decades of autocratic secularist rule and described its goal as "the coexistence of democracy and Islam".

But its record seems more favorable to the Salafis than he presents it. In its first year, the government approved three Salafi groups and Hezb ut-Tahrir, an international movement calling for an Islamic caliphate, as legal political parties.

It also registered about 200 new Salafi charities and schools and allowed radical preachers from the Gulf and Egypt to go on speaking tours around the country. "There is no control over their activities or revenues," Allani said.

Khadmi's image is also ambiguous. Critics say the minister, who sports a trim beard and stylish suit, was a fiery preacher calling for jihad at a radical mosque before his appointment. He dismisses this as lies from opponents of the 2011 revolution.

Ennahda's approach began to change in September 2012 after hundreds of radicals attacked the United States embassy in Tunis to protest against a film ridiculing the Prophet Mohammad.

Its resolve further stiffened this year as the jihadi group Ansar al-Sharia repeatedly clashed with army troops in western Tunisia, and following the assassinations of the two secular opposition leaders.

But it was only last week that Prime Minister Ali Larayedh banned Ansar as a terrorist group - after having previously described its training areas in the rugged western mountains as sports camps.

LOOMING DEFEAT AND SPLIT

Ennahda's ambiguous religious policies stem from its own internal conflicts, said Allani. He estimates that Ennahda's more liberal wing represents only one-third of the party base while two-thirds are conservative to hardline in their views.

Party leader Rached Ghannouchi has tried to balance between the two camps and is reluctant to confront the hardliners by cracking down on the Salafis, according to Allani.

Tension seems to be increasing in the ranks as Ghannouchi, sensing probable defeat at the polls due next year, tries to steer the party to a compromise with the secular opposition and the best starting position for its next electoral campaign.

"What you could see happening, if they perform very badly in the elections, is a split in the party, into either a more radical and a more moderate political wing, or into a political and a religious wing," said Howard.

"The liberal wing of Ennahda could be accepted by Tunisian society," Allani said. "There is a chance it could even be a partner in the next government coalition."



headline: Unannounced Israel-U.S. missile test fuels jitters over Syria
byline: By Dan Williams and Steve Gutterman
6:20pm EDT

backed missile system in the Mediterranean on Tuesday but did not announce the launch in advance, prompting a disclosure by Russia that kept the world on edge as the United States weighed an attack on Syria.

The morning launch was first reported by Moscow media that quoted Russian defense officials as saying two ballistic "objects" had been fired eastward from the center of the sea - roughly in the direction of Syria.

The news ruffled financial markets until Israel's Defence Ministry said that it, along with a Pentagon team, had carried out a test-launch of a Sparrow missile. The Sparrow, which simulates the long-range missiles of Syria and Iran, is used for target practice by Israel's U.S.-backed ballistic shield Arrow.

"Israel routinely fires missiles or drones off its shores to test its own ballistic defense capabilities," a U.S. official said in Washington.

Western naval forces have been gathering in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea since President Bashar al-Assad was accused of carrying out an August 21 gas attack in his more than two-year-old conflict with rebels trying to topple him.

Damascus denies responsibility for the incident. U.S. President Barack Obama had been widely expected to order reprisal strikes on Syria last week but put them off to seek support from Washington lawmakers first.

With U.S. action on Syria delayed as Obama confers with Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought to play up the Jewish state's ability to deal with its foes alone. On Tuesday, the rightist premier spoke of anti-missile systems as a national "wall of iron".

"These things give us the power to protect ourselves, and anyone who considers harming us would do best not to," he said in a speech.

Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon shrugged off a question from reporters on whether the launch might have been ill-timed. He said Israel had to work to maintain its military edge and "this necessitates field trials and, accordingly, a successful trial was conducted to test our systems. And we will continue to develop and to research and to equip the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) with the best systems in the world."

missile system are planned "long, long in advance" and generally go unnoticed. "What apparently made the difference today is the high state of tension over Syria and Russia's unusual vigilance," he told Reuters.

A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman quoted by the Interfax news agency said the launch was picked up by an early warning radar station at Armavir, near the Black Sea, which is designed to detect missiles from Europe and Iran.

RIA, another Russian news agency, later quoted a source in Syria's "state structures" as saying the objects had fallen harmlessly into the sea.

The Russian Defence Ministry declined comment to Reuters.

Moscow is Assad's big-power ally and has mobilized its own navy in the face of U.S. military preparations to punish the Syrian government for its alleged killing of more than 1,400 people in the chemical strike in an embattled Damascus suburb.

OUTSIDE INTERVENTION

Russia opposes any outside military intervention in Syria's civil war and says it suspects the gassings were staged by rebels seeking foreign involvement in the conflict.

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu informed President Vladimir Putin of the launch but it was not immediately clear how he reacted.

Brent crude oil extended gains to rise by more than $1 per barrel and Dubai's share index fell after Russia said it detected the launches.

Five U.S. destroyers and an amphibious ship are in the Mediterranean, poised for possible strikes against Syria with cruise missiles - which are not ballistic. U.S. officials said the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and four other ships in its strike group moved into the Red Sea on Monday.

"The pressure being applied by the United States causes particular concern," Itar-Tass quoted Russian Defence Ministry official Oleg Dogayev as saying. He said "the dispatch of ships armed with cruise missiles toward Syria's shores has a negative effect on the situation in the region".

The United States sees its underwriting of the Arrow as a means of reassuring Israel and, by extension, of reducing the chance that its ally might launch unilateral attacks on Syria or Iran that could destabilize the wider region.

Netanyahu has reluctantly supported U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to curb Iran's nuclear program. He has been circumspect about the Western showdown with Syria, worrying that should Assad fall to Islamist-led rebels, they could prove more hostile to the Jewish state.

headline: Ukraine leader urges pro-Europe drive despite Kremlin pressure
byline: By Richard Balmforth
6:20pm EDT

Europe drive, even as Russia renewed pressure on Kiev to halt its westward course.

But, with European envoys looking on, opposition politicians accused Yanukovich of endangering Ukraine's pro-Europe policy himself by failing to pledge an end to political trials and staying silent over his arch-rival, jailed ex-prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, whom Western governments want to be freed.

The European Union says her trial for abuse of office was political and her continued confinement could still jeopardize the signing of key association and free trade agreements with Ukraine at a summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, in November.

"The issue of Yulia Tymoshenko's release is a question of the political will of President Viktor Yanukovich exclusively. Our principled position is that this was a political sentencing and it must be repealed, and quickly," said Vitaly Klitschko, the world boxing champion and potential challenger for the Ukrainian presidency who heads the UDAR (Punch) party.

In a keynote speech to parliament, Yanukovich urged deputies to prepare draft legislation to reform the judiciary and law-enforcement bodies and fight corruption to help bring the former Soviet republic more in line with EU standards.

The 28-member EU has set criteria for democratic progress which it says Ukraine must meet if the landmark agreements are to be signed in November.

"Success at the Vilnius summit must be prepared. Documents, vital for our further advancement towards Europe, must be approved. This is work which the Ukrainian parliament must do in order for Ukraine to be able to sign agreements on association and free trade with the EU," he declared.

Even as the Kiev government seeks to persuade the EU that Ukraine is a fit partner for the future, it has come under pressure from Russia, its biggest single trading partner which wants to entice it instead into a Russia-led Customs Union.

Russia fears a flood of highly competitive goods on the Russian market if Ukraine joins an EU free-trade zone.

In a warning shot to Ukraine, Russia conducted extra customs checks on Ukrainian imports over several days last month and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke of possible "protective" measures by Moscow and its Customs Union allies, Belarus and Kazakhstan.

TRADE WAR TALK

The pressure has led to talk of a trade war in Kiev and injected new tension into Moscow's relationship with Ukraine, which has pleaded unsuccessfully for a lower price for strategic supplies of Russian gas to bring relief to its economy.

The Kremlin renewed its charge over Ukraine's westward thrust on Tuesday with a Putin aide warning that Kiev would forfeit special partner status if it went ahead with signing the EU agreements.

Sergei Glazev, Putin's point man on relations in the Customs Union, said this would put Ukraine in violation of a bilateral friendship and cooperation agreement with Russia.

"To sum up, by signing the Association Agreement (with the EU) Ukraine will lose its self-reliance and for us will cease to be a strategic, a complete, partner," Glazev said in an interview with Kommersant Ukraine newspaper.

Russia, which would like control of Ukraine's gas pipeline network, has used the promise of much cheaper gas to try to coax Kiev into the Customs Union - proposals dismissed by Yanukovich last week as "humiliating".

On Tuesday, he sought to calm Moscow's concerns saying that Ukraine would always regard Russia as a strategic partner.

"Attempts to set cooperation in the European direction against cooperation with our strategic partners - Russia and the countries of the Eurasian society - are groundless."

While Kiev has stuck to its aspiration to join the European mainstream, diplomats say it is unlikely the agreements will be signed unless Yanukovich relaxes his stance on Tymoshenko.

Tymoshenko, his most dangerous opponent, was jailed for seven years in 2011. But she would be a real threat to his chances of re-election in 2015 if she were freed and Yanukovich has shown no inclination to bow to EU pressure for her release.

European envoys are trying to persuade him to pardon her so she can go to Germany for treatment for back trouble. But he says he had no legal powers to allow this.

border oil exports.

South Sudanese President Salva Kiir flew to Khartoum for a day of talks with his Sudanese counterpart Omar Hassan al-Bashir in his only second visit since South Sudan's secession in 2011.

Diplomats hoped the meeting would defuse recent tensions and help build trust between the neighbors, who fought one of Africa's longest civil wars until 2005.

The two agreed in March to resume oil exports from landlocked South Sudan through the north, its only route to market. Juba had stopped oil flows for 16 months when a conflict over disputed territory and pipeline fees flared last year.

But Sudan has threatened to again stop oil shipments by Friday unless Juba cuts ties with rebels operating across the almost 2,000-km (1,300-mile)-long border. South Sudan denies supporting the insurgents.

At the start of their meeting Bashir and Kiir said they were committed to all bilateral cooperation agreements including oil, without mentioning the crude stoppage threat.

"We are committed to implement the agreements signed by the two countries," Bashir told the start of the joint session open to the media. "We want to leave the problems of the past behind us and open a new page for the benefit of the two people," he said, adding that any rebel support would have to stop.

Kiir also said he wanted a new chapter in bilateral ties and open the joint border for trade, a move agreed in September but not implemented by Sudan due to Juba's alleged rebel support.

"You closed the border. We didn't do that but we're ready to reopen it within 24 hours," Kiir said, adding that Juba did not support any Sudanese insurgents.

South Sudan relies heavily on oil exports to fund its budget and any shutdown could have serious economic and political implications.

Diplomats doubt Sudan will seal off the two cross-border pipelines as it needs South Sudan's transit fees to stabilize its economy reeling from the loss of most oil reserves with southern secession. Khartoum has several times extended a deadline threatening a halt of oil flows.

Apart from rebel support, the neighbors are also at loggerheads over disputed frontier areas such as Abyei, which is highly symbolic to both countries.

headline: Manila accuses China of sea violation, Beijing says wants peace

The Philippines accused China on Tuesday of violating an informal code of conduct in the South China Sea by planning new structures on a disputed shoal, as China's premier told Southeast Asian leaders Beijing was serious about peace.

Friction over the South China Sea, one of the world's most important waterways, has surged as China uses its growing naval might to assert its vast claims over the oil- and gas-rich sea more forcefully, raising fears of a military clash.

Four of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including Vietnam and the Philippines, have overlapping claims with China.

China and the Philippines accuse each other of violating the Declaration of Conduct (DoC), a non-binding confidence-building agreement on maritime conduct signed by China and ASEAN in 2002.

Philippines Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin told a congressional budget hearing in Manila that China had violated the DoC by getting ready to build new structures on the disputed Scarborough Shoal.

"We have ... sighted concrete blocks inside the shoal which are a prelude to construction," Gazmin said, displaying air surveillance photos of the rocks.

He said the photos were taken on Saturday, describing them as a worrying pattern of construction that would be similar to the building of a garrison on Mischief Reef in the late 1990s.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said he had "no information" about Gazmin's accusations.

Regional security scholar Ian Storey said that if Gazmin was correct, it would mark the biggest violation yet of the 2002 declaration.

"If China starts building at Scarborough, then it is an occupation and, I believe, the most egregious violation yet of the 2002 declaration," said Storey, who is based at Singapore's Institute of South East Asian Studies.

"It is a very significant development indeed and one that will certainly add to tensions."

Speaking at a China-ASEAN trade fair in the southern Chinese city of Nanning, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said his country was serious about wanting a peaceful resolution to the South China Sea disputes, though signaled it was in no rush to sign a long-mooted accord to replace the DoC.

After years of resisting efforts by ASEAN to start talks on an agreement on maritime rules governing behavior in the region, the so-called Code of Conduct, China has said it would host talks between senior officials this month.

Li said China had always advocated talks on the South China Sea on the basis of "respecting historical reality and international law".

"The Chinese government is willing and ready to assume a policy of seeking an appropriate resolution through friendly consultations," Li told the audience, which included Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

China would "proceed systematically and soundly push forward talks on the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea", Li said without elaborating in comments aired live on state television.

He also repeated that talks on the dispute should only be carried out between the parties directly concerned, Beijing's standard line which rejects the involvement of outside parties such as the United States or multilateral forums.

Washington has not taken sides, but Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated in Brunei in July the U.S. strategic interest in freedom of navigation through the busy sea and its desire to see a Code of Conduct signed quickly.

Critics say China is intent on cementing its claims over the sea through its superior and growing naval might, and has little interest in rushing to agree to the Code of Conduct.



headline: Egypt's Brotherhood under legal threat as bomb hits central Cairo
byline: By Kevin Liffey
6:20pm EDT

An Egyptian judicial panel supported a legal challenge to the status of the Muslim Brotherhood on Monday, compounding a drive to crush the movement behind the elected president deposed by the army in July.

While short of a formal ban on the Brotherhood, which worked underground for decades under Egypt's previous military-backed rulers, the panel's advice to a court to remove its non-governmental organization status threatens the million-member movement's future in politics.

An attack on a police station in central Cairo and plans for new mass protests by the Brotherhood on Tuesday showed the stability the interim government says it took over to impose after two-and-a-half years of turmoil is still elusive.

At least 900 people, most of them Islamist supporters of ousted President Mohamed Mursi, have been killed since the army takeover on July 3. The government has accused the Brotherhood of inciting violence and terrorism, and arrested its leaders.

Egypt's oldest political organization, the Brotherhood won a series of elections after protesters forced out longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak in 2011, culminating in last year's presidential vote. It formally registered itself in March as an NGO to secure its legal status.

The judicial panel backed Brotherhood opponents who argued that the NGO registration was illegal because the Brotherhood-led government had effectively issued a license to itself.

The panel's recommendation to the court due to rule on the case is not binding, judicial sources said, adding that the court's next session would be on November 12.

It adds to a whole array of steps taken against the Brotherhood since the army stepped in after mass protests against economic mismanagement and attempts to entrench the movement's power during Mursi's rule.

The Brotherhood formally operates in the political arena as the Freedom and Justice Party. There has so far been no attempt to outlaw the party, but its NGO status was seen as a bulwark against legal attack.

'MILLION-PERSON MARCH'

Most of the group's top leaders have been arrested and face charges of inciting violence or murder. Mursi was himself referred to trial on Sunday on those charges.

Authorities arrested on Monday one of the few remaining senior Brotherhood members who had thus far managed to evade arrest, the state news agency reported.

MENA quoted unnamed security officials as saying police had arrested Saad Husseini, who had served as governor of the Nile Delta province of Kafr el-Sheikh under Mursi, at an apartment in a Cairo suburb.

The government is shaping a new constitution to remove the Islamist additions that the Brotherhood introduced.

On Sunday it tasked a 50-member constituent assembly, which includes only two Islamists, with reviewing a draft constitution that may allow members of Mubarak's government, banned from office after the 2011 revolution, to return.

The Brotherhood accuses the "putschist regime" of staging a coup against democracy and fabricating allegations of violence and terrorism to justify a drive to erase it from public life.

The National Coalition for Legitimacy, which includes the Brotherhood, called for a "million-person march" in all Egypt's squares on Tuesday under the slogan "The Coup is Terrorism". At least six people were killed during similar protests last week.

Although the Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful resistance, fears have grown that attacks by Islamist radicals, such as those that have already hit lawless Northern Sinai, could develop into a wider insurgency.

Memories are still vivid of an Islamist insurgency in the 1990s, when bombs and shootings destabilized Egypt and ravaged tourism.

Three people on a motorcycle hurled a homemade hand grenade at a police station in a working class area of central Cairo on Monday, wounding two workers, the state news agency said.

On Sunday, an army source said three people had been arrested for firing machineguns on Saturday at a container ship passing through the Suez Canal, the global shipping artery that runs through Egyptian territory. Canal Authority sources said a rocket-propelled grenade had also been used in the attack.

As well as being vital to global trade, the canal is one of Egypt's most important sources of income.

immigration party.

Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg guided Norway through a global downturn with little more than a scratch. But growth is slowing, his record on health care is mixed and critics accuse him of squandering the oil revenues that have shielded Norway.

Opinion polls suggest Conservative leader Erna Solberg, an admirer of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, would need the support of smaller parties, raising the prospect that the populist Progress Party, which wants to restrict immigration, could hold the balance of power.

While Progress may get fewer votes than four years ago, it will likely enter government for the first time, marking another big step for populist anti-immigration parties after gains in Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Progress itself however has moderated its tone and could make more concessions to enter government.

"I don't think the government is the reason everything went so well for Norway through Europe's crisis," Daniel Sundkvist, a nurse from Oslo said.

"I'm not sure things will improve when others are in charge, but I am convinced that we have to get rid of the government," Sundkvist, 36, added. "I've seen what they did to health care over the past eight years and they've made it worse, both for the patients and also for those who work in it."

Polls give Stoltenberg's Labour around 30 percent, making it the biggest single party. But opposition parties, all of whom campaign on unseating the government, are on course for at least a 10-seat majority in parliament.

"The government has been in majority for eight years; the cost of rule is taking its toll and people want change," Sveinung Arnesen, a political analyst at the UNI Rokkan Centre for Social Research said.

MINORITY GOVERNMENT?

The biggest risk to a center-right coalition is the Progress Party, which was seen by some as too radical for government and once had among its members Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in 2011 in a gun and bomb attack targeting Labour.

The party has toned down its image. But some of its more radical stances on immigration and spending may be too much to swallow for the small Christian Democrats and Liberals, whose vote may be needed for a majority.

"They are not a far-right party. They are a populist right party and with some similarities with other populist and populist radical parties in Europe," Elisabeth Ivarsflaten, a political scientist at the University of Bergen said.

"But they seem really intent on joining the government so they'll probably compromise on a lot of issues," she added.

Working with Progress on immigration could be hard after the party unveiled plans to cut immigration from outside the EU by half and reduce the number of asylum seekers it accepts.

Although net immigration is high, swelling Norway's population by 1 percent each year, unemployment is below 3 percent and companies desperately need fresh workers.

Bringing all four disparate opposition parties into a coalition may be too hard, raising the prospect that Solberg would rule in a minority government - not unusual in Norway due in part to laws that do not allow for early elections.

IRON ERNA

Solberg, 52, nicknamed "Iron Erna" for her tough stances when she served in cabinet between 2001 and 2005, will rely on her skill to keep Progress in check, yielding on a few issues like tax cuts and infrastructure spending and perhaps making a symbolic gesture on immigration.

Solberg seems set to become prime minister on her third attempt after steering her party closer to the center.

Breaking with Conservative tradition, she did not focus her campaign on issues like tax cuts and easing regulation, instead making health care, road building and education her primary topics.

"We have not used the best time we have experienced in the economy in Norway's history to invest in the future," she said. "Our economy stands on one leg, the oil sector. What happens if oil prices fall? What will happen after the oil age is over?"

Although Norway has outperformed Europe for the past several years, its economy is slowing and Stoltenberg, seen as a top economic manager, disturbed international investors this year when he unveiled Norway's first oil tax hike in decades.

Solberg has promised to cut taxes, sell down stakes in firms like Telenor and Statoil, reduce the size of government and ease business regulation. She campaigns on boosting health and infrastructure spending without inflating the budget.

Fiscal responsibility may be her biggest issue. The Progress Party is seen as a keen spender, hoping to invest some of the $750 billion, or $150,000 per man, woman and child that Norway has saved up from oil revenues on infrastructure.

Solberg may give the party the finance ministry, forcing it to hold back on spending or risk looking irresponsible.

"Progress is really keen on getting into power, they've been preparing for a long time for this so they really want to look responsible," Arnesen said.

headline: Brazil, Mexico ask U.S. to explain if NSA spied on presidents

6:20pm EDT

Brazil assailed the United States on Monday after new allegations that Washington spied on President Dilma Rousseff, complaining that its sovereignty may have been violated and suggesting that it could call off Rousseff's planned state visit to the White House next month.

A Brazilian news program reported on Sunday that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on emails, phone calls and text messages of Rousseff and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, a disclosure that could strain Washington's relations with Latin America's two biggest nations.

Mexico asked the United States to investigate the allegations, saying they would be a serious violation of its sovereignty if proven true.

Brazil's government, already smarting from earlier reports that the NSA spied on the emails and phone calls of Brazilians, called in U.S. ambassador Thomas Shannon and gave the U.S. government until the end of the week to provide a written explanation of the new spying disclosures based on documents leaked by fugitive former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

"I expressed to (Shannon) the Brazilian government's indignation over the facts revealed in the documents," Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo said at a news conference.

"From our point of view, this is an inadmissible and unacceptable violation of Brazilian sovereignty," he said.

Figueiredo declined to explicitly say whether the allegations could lead Rousseff to call off her visit to Washington, the only state visit offered by President Barack Obama this year. The trip had been intended to highlight improving U.S.-Brazil ties since Rousseff took office in 2011.

But, in response to a question from reporters about the visit, he said that Brazil's response to the allegations "will depend" on the U.S. explanation.

The report by Globo's news program "Fantastico" was based on documents obtained from Snowden by journalist Glenn Greenwald, who lives in Rio de Janeiro and was listed as a co-contributor to the report.

"Fantastico" showed what it said was an NSA slide dated June 2012 displaying passages of written messages sent by Pena Nieto, who was still a Mexican presidential candidate at that time. In the messages, Pena Nieto discussed who he was considering naming as his ministers once elected.

A separate slide displayed communication patterns between Rousseff and her top advisers, "Fantastico" said, although no specific written passages were included in the report.

Both sLides were part of an NSA case study showing how data could be "intelligently" filtered by the agency's secret internet surveillance programs that were disclosed in a trove of documents leaked by Snowden in June, "Fantastico" said.

STATE VISIT, F-18 JETS

The Brazilian Senate, where some members have proposed offering Snowden political asylum in Brazil, launched an inquiry into the secret surveillance of Brazilian Internet communications by the NSA.

Rousseff held a Cabinet meeting on Monday that included the country's defense, justice, communications and foreign ministers to discuss a response to the new espionage report.

The White said it would respond to the requests of its "partners and allies" through diplomatic channels.

"While we are not going to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity, as a matter of policy we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations," said White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden.

Mexico's Foreign Ministry said that although it could not comment on the veracity of the report, it "categorically rejects and condemns any kind of spying against Mexican citizens in breach of international law."

A ministry statement added that Mexico had asked the U.S. government for a thorough investigation of the matter and that, if necessary, Washington should explain who was responsible.

"Mexico's foreign ministry has summoned the U.S. ambassador to express its clear dismay and to demand that the aforementioned investigation be carried out," it said.

In July, after initial reports of NSA surveillance of internet communications in Latin American nations, Mexico's Pena Nieto said it would be "totally unacceptable" if it were revealed that the United States had spied on its neighbor and largest business partner in the region.

The United States is hoping to sell Brazil 36 F-18 fighter jets, but a Brazilian government official said manufacturer Boeing's chances of landing the more than $4 billion deal have been set back by the espionage scandal.

During a visit last month, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged Brazil not to let spying revelations derail growing trade, diplomatic and cultural relations between the two largest economies in the Americas. But he gave no indication the United States would end the secret surveillance.

Kerry said the NSA surveillance was aimed at protecting Americans and Brazilians from terrorist attacks.

Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo said on Monday the latest revelations based on Snowden's documents show that U.S. electronic surveillance goes beyond combating terrorism and has political targets and may even involve commercial espionage.

Cardozo traveled to Washington last week and met with U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden and other officials, seeking more details on the previous, seemingly less serious set of disclosures by Snowden regarding U.S. spying in Brazil.

headline: Beatings, evictions reveal ugly side of China's local debt pile
byline: By Koh Gui Qing
6:20pm EDT

When Xu Haifeng's home was razed three years ago, she went to China's capital Beijing to complain about the city and county governments that ordered the demolition.

Since then, she says family members have been kidnapped at least 18 times, typically having black bags thrust over their heads before being taken to a hotel-turned-illegal jail in the eastern city of Wuxi and locked for weeks in a tiny, windowless room.

Xu's story is shocking even in a country that has become used to tales of arbitrary and sometimes violent land expropriations. It illustrates how the stresses from the deep indebtedness of China's local governments extend beyond banks into the lives of ordinary Chinese, as hard-up authorities resort to any means they can in a desperate scramble for funds.

"Our Wuxi is now steep in debt," said Xu. "The Wuxi city today relies on drawing from residents' financial wealth and stealing residents' land to survive."

Her 74-year-old mother, she says, has been abducted nearly a dozen times and held illegally for almost a year in a campaign to silence the family's demands for proper compensation.

Land seizures rank as among the biggest causes of social tension in China, spotlighting an ugly side of the urbanization drive that has raised it to the world's second-biggest economy.

Amnesty International said in a report last year that land grabs have increased as the economy slows and local governments have sought cash to pay off debt, though other experts dispute the finding. There is no official data on land grabs.

DEEP IN DEBT

Wuxi lies in the coastal province of Jiangsu, home to China's most indebted local government.

Public records show provincial, city and county governments in Jiangsu have borrowed heavily from banks and investors to fund big construction projects and investments.

Pressured finances may be capping land payouts and fuelling state-sanctioned violence, said Li Guoxiang, deputy director of rural development research at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think-tank.

"The logic is simple: if there is no fiscal health, how can the government hand out fair compensation?" Li said.

Residents of the Binhu district of Wuxi, where Xu's family owned several properties, say authorities took their land on the cheap, accompanied by threats, beatings and illegal detention of those who did not acquiesce.

The allegations, which included claims that the harsh treatment had caused deaths, could not be independently verified.

The government of Binhu, a county overseen by Wuxi city authorities, could not be reached for comment. The Wuxi government also could not be reached for comment, with repeated telephone calls over several days going unanswered.

Although the allegations in Binhu are extreme, land grabs are not uncommon. According to Li, local authorities across China derive between 20 and 90 percent of their income from selling expropriated land.

Land disputes are one of the main causes of the tens of thousands of protests across China each year. Most go unreported, although some, like a revolt in the southern village of Wukan in 2011, have attracted a high profile and prompted promises of action by Beijing.

Just last Thursday, a four-year-old girl was killed by a bulldozer that was razing her home during a land grab in the southeastern province of Fujian, local media reported.

HEAVY INVESTMENT

Following 30 years of stellar double-digit growth, China's economy in maturing.

But policymakers are struggling to shift gears and allow consumption, not investment, to power activity at a time when strong economic expansion is needed to repay some 9.7 trillion yuan ($1.6 trillion) that local governments borrowed from banks.

Much of China's massive fiscal stimulus after the 2008/09 financial crisis was funded by these bank loans, and investors worry that a hefty chunk of them may sour, having mostly paid for non-lucrative public works such as sewage systems.

A 30-minute train ride north of Shanghai, Jiangsu is China's wealthiest province and an exemplar of the country's old export-led growth model. Investment was worth 59 percent of Jiangsu's economy in 2012.

The local authorities envision turning Wuxi into a center for information and technology, a Chinese answer to Silicon Valley that will move its factories up the value chain.

Yet that dream of a new economy, built around a vast software park the size of 3,500 football fields in south Binhu, still hinges on large state investment.

Authorities have not revealed the cost, but Wuxi Taihu International Technology Park Investment Development, a firm belonging to the Wuxi government and the main financier of "T-Park", is in financial throes.

Public records show it suffered negative operating cash flows every year in the last four years, with outflows hitting 762 million yuan in 2012. It has total debt of 5.9 billion yuan - or a 10th of Wuxi's 2012 fiscal revenues - and has been hit by cash shortfalls, analysts from Chinese rating agency CCXI said.

"The firm has a strong public service element and a weak earning power," CCXI said in a note, noting that its ability to repay investors depends on how much cash the government raises from selling land.

Public records show the Wuxi government has at least three other financing firms that raise debt on its behalf. Two of these firms had negative net operating cash flows of between 0.4 billion yuan and 4.8 billion yuan every year from 2009 to 2011.

Investments by the Wuxi and Jiangsu governments have ended badly before. They led a rapid expansion in the province's shipbuilding and solar panel industries into some of the world's biggest over the last decade. But over-zealous investment created excess capacity, and both sectors now nurse huge losses.

BEATINGS, THREATS

To make way for T-Park, the Binhu government cleared farms and relocated residents, who were given new housing. To pay for the homes, authorities sold 1 billion yuan worth of bonds last year through Wuxi Taihu International.

But the cost of mass relocation has taken its toll, just as governments' tax income is also sliding. Officials in a town in Binhu tried to dock the salaries of some civil servants last year but quickly retracted the plan, residents said.

An online copy of the notice announcing the plan to dock wages said the government faced "arduous and heavy" relocation work and was under "huge financial pressure".

Xu, whose demolished home lay to the west of T-Park, said the government had offered to buy her house and land for 2.4 million yuan, or around 4,140 yuan per square meter. An online search showed new houses in the area are currently selling for between 10,100 yuan to 17,840 yuan per square meter.

Things turned ugly, Xu said, when she rejected the offer. Officials cut her water and electricity supply and Xu and her husband were threatened and beaten.

"One of them called and he claimed to be Hu Jintao," Xu said, referring to a man harassing her family. Hu is China's former president. "He said 'I am Hu Jintao'. So what if we are demolishing your home? What can you do?'"

Xu said her husband eventually signed the deal under threat, but the family has only received 1 million yuan in compensation. Their house was torn down by a work crew hired by the government for 200 yuan and a pack of cigarettes each, her husband said.

The family owned several houses in their village before they were relocated and have received eight smaller apartments from the government in compensation.

But Xu said the apartments did not come with property deeds, and the 580-square-metre (6,240 sq ft) house that was their family home and most valuable asset has not been properly accounted for.

Elsewhere in Binhu, similar accusations abound. A group of five residents in the next village said authorities refused to recognize property deeds dated before 1979, when China's modern economy was created, and those homes were razed without compensation. Some said the government told them they own too many homes and that it cannot afford to pay for them all.

At least 41 Chinese have set themselves on fire to protest land grabs since 2009, Amnesty said in a report last year.

"You have to generate growth if you are a local government official," said Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong. "The easiest way of doing that is flipping land."

"Fantastico" showed what it said was an NSA slide dated June 2012 displaying passages of written messages sent by Pena Nieto, who was still a Mexican presidential candidate at that time. In the messages, Pena Nieto discussed who he was considering naming as his ministers once elected.

A separate slide displayed communication patterns between Rousseff and her top advisers, "Fantastico" said, although no specific written passages were included in the report.

Both sLides were part of an NSA case study showing how data could be "intelligently" filtered by the agency's secret internet surveillance programs that were disclosed in a trove of documents leaked by Snowden in June, "Fantastico" said.

STATE VISIT, F-18 JETS

The Brazilian Senate, where some members have proposed offering Snowden political asylum in Brazil, launched an inquiry into the secret surveillance of Brazilian Internet communications by the NSA.

Rousseff held a Cabinet meeting on Monday that included the country's defense, justice, communications and foreign ministers to discuss a response to the new espionage report.

The White said it would respond to the requests of its "partners and allies" through diplomatic channels.

"While we are not going to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity, as a matter of policy we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations," said White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden.

Mexico's Foreign Ministry said that although it could not comment on the veracity of the report, it "categorically rejects and condemns any kind of spying against Mexican citizens in breach of international law."

A ministry statement added that Mexico had asked the U.S. government for a thorough investigation of the matter and that, if necessary, Washington should explain who was responsible.

"Mexico's foreign ministry has summoned the U.S. ambassador to express its clear dismay and to demand that the aforementioned investigation be carried out," it said.

In July, after initial reports of NSA surveillance of internet communications in Latin American nations, Mexico's Pena Nieto said it would be "totally unacceptable" if it were revealed that the United States had spied on its neighbor and largest business partner in the region.

The United States is hoping to sell Brazil 36 F-18 fighter jets, but a Brazilian government official said manufacturer Boeing's chances of landing the more than $4 billion deal have been set back by the espionage scandal.

During a visit last month, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged Brazil not to let spying revelations derail growing trade, diplomatic and cultural relations between the two largest economies in the Americas. But he gave no indication the United States would end the secret surveillance.

Kerry said the NSA surveillance was aimed at protecting Americans and Brazilians from terrorist attacks.

Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo said on Monday the latest revelations based on Snowden's documents show that U.S. electronic surveillance goes beyond combating terrorism and has political targets and may even involve commercial espionage.

Cardozo traveled to Washington last week and met with U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden and other officials, seeking more details on the previous, seemingly less serious set of disclosures by Snowden regarding U.S. spying in Brazil.

6:20pm EDT

old former McKinsey consultant Lazar Krstic as finance minister on Monday, handing him the task of reining in the country's ballooning deficit and public debt.

Krstic brings no political pedigree to the job but was handpicked by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), the biggest party in Serbia's ruling coalition.

The Yale graduate was endorsed as part of a cabinet reshuffle passed by 134 votes to 65 in the 250-seat parliament.

The SNS says it is serious about pursuing painful reforms and spending cuts to stabilize Serbia's finances, and has threatened its Socialist coalition partners under Prime Minister Ivica Dacic with a snap election if they resist.

Krstic has pledged to seek a new loan deal with the International Monetary Fund, which will probably require long-resisted cuts in spending on pensioners and state enterprises to curb a budget deficit of at least 4.7 percent of national output and public debt projected at 65 percent by year-end.

Pensioners and the public sector account for about one third of the Serbian electorate and half its outgoings. The IMF has said that without significant reform Serbia's budget shortfall will reach eight percent of gross domestic product.

The Fund froze an earlier 1 billion euro ($1.3 billion) standby loan deal with the former Yugoslav republic early last year over broken spending promises by the previous government. The absence of an IMF safety net has pressured the Serbian dinar and driven up borrowing costs.

Serbia, a candidate for membership of the European Union, emerged from recession in the first quarter of the year, but growth remains fragile.

headline: U.N. envoy says military success an opportunity for Congo talks
byline: By Pete Jones
6:20pm EDT

The U.N. special envoy for Africa's Great Lakes region said on Monday recent military successes by Congo's army against eastern rebels should be used to relaunch peace talks.

Democratic Republic of Congo's army drove M23 rebels from positions overlooking the eastern city of Goma on Friday, scoring its biggest victory since the uprising began 18 months ago.

"When there is a military victory like this, it is a chance to advance with a political solution, and that is better for a durable peace," said envoy Mary Robinson, a former Irish prime minister, without going into further details.

The military breakthrough came after a new U.N. intervention brigade, with a tough mandate to crush armed groups, entered combat for the first time. U.N. artillery and helicopters pounded M23 positions in Kabati, 11 km north of Goma, until rebels withdrew.

Millions of people have died from violence, disease and hunger since the 1990s as foreign-backed ethnic rebel groups have fought for control of eastern Congo's rich deposits of gold, diamonds and tin, destabilizing the Great Lakes region.

Congo opened peace talks in Kampala, the capital of neighboring Uganda, after the rebels briefly seized Goma in late 2012, but the negotiations quickly stalled.

"This time it must be different. At the international level we are engaged more than ever before," Robinson said.

She is visiting the vast, former Belgian colony as part of an international mission including the United States special envoy for the Great Lakes region, Russ Feingold, and the special representative of the African Union, Boubacar Diarra.

INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE

Regional leaders will meet in Kampala on Thursday to discuss Congo, with world powers increasing pressure for a solution.

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon visited the region in May, offering $1 billion in World Bank funding if nations stuck to a February deal not to support rebels on each others' soil.

Robinson noted there was evidence that the Tutsi-dominated government in neighboring Rwanda was supporting M23, whose leaders come from the same ethnic group. In 2012, U.N. investigators accused Rwanda of backing the rebels, a charge Rwanda has denied.

"There is a strong perception (Rwanda is supporting M23), there seems to be some evidence for that," said Robinson. "This is having an impact on how donor countries perceive the situation."

M23 took up arms accusing Congo's government of failing to honor the terms of a 2009 peace deal that ended four years of Tutsi rebellion in the east. It accuses Kinshasa of backing Hutu militia linked to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.

Robinson said she supported the military action by the Congolese army and the new 3,000-strong U.N. Brigade, which intervened directly for the first time on August 23 after rebel shells landed in Goma, killing at least three civilians.

"Sometimes a military engagement is necessary to protect the population," she said in Goma, a lakeside city of one million on Congo's border with Rwanda.

During nearly two weeks of fighting, rockets have also landed in Rwanda, killing civilians.

The government in Kigali warned it would not tolerate such "provocation", raising fears it could intervene directly in eastern Congo - where it has fought two wars in the last two decades under the pretext of hunting down Hutu militia.

Congolese army spokesman Lt Colonel Olivier Hamuli said on Monday the front had been calm for the past two days.

"We must consolidate our positions," he said.

headline: Beatings, evictions reveal ugly side of China's local debt pile
byline: By Koh Gui Qing
6:20pm EDT

When Xu Haifeng's home was razed three years ago, she went to China's capital Beijing to complain about the city and county governments that ordered the demolition.

Since then, she says family members have been kidnapped at least 18 times, typically having black bags thrust over their heads before being taken to a hotel-turned-illegal jail in the eastern city of Wuxi and locked for weeks in a tiny, windowless room.

Xu's story is shocking even in a country that has become used to tales of arbitrary and sometimes violent land expropriations. It illustrates how the stresses from the deep indebtedness of China's local governments extend beyond banks into the lives of ordinary Chinese, as hard-up authorities resort to any means they can in a desperate scramble for funds.

"Our Wuxi is now steep in debt," said Xu. "The Wuxi city today relies on drawing from residents' financial wealth and stealing residents' land to survive."

Her 74-year-old mother, she says, has been abducted nearly a dozen times and held illegally for almost a year in a campaign to silence the family's demands for proper compensation.

Land seizures rank as among the biggest causes of social tension in China, spotlighting an ugly side of the urbanization drive that has raised it to the world's second-biggest economy.

Amnesty International said in a report last year that land grabs have increased as the economy slows and local governments have sought cash to pay off debt, though other experts dispute the finding. There is no official data on land grabs.

DEEP IN DEBT

Wuxi lies in the coastal province of Jiangsu, home to China's most indebted local government.

Public records show provincial, city and county governments in Jiangsu have borrowed heavily from banks and investors to fund big construction projects and investments.

Pressured finances may be capping land payouts and fuelling state-sanctioned violence, said Li Guoxiang, deputy director of rural development research at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think-tank.

"The logic is simple: if there is no fiscal health, how can the government hand out fair compensation?" Li said.

Residents of the Binhu district of Wuxi, where Xu's family owned several properties, say authorities took their land on the cheap, accompanied by threats, beatings and illegal detention of those who did not acquiesce.

The allegations, which included claims that the harsh treatment had caused deaths, could not be independently verified.

The government of Binhu, a county overseen by Wuxi city authorities, could not be reached for comment. The Wuxi government also could not be reached for comment, with repeated telephone calls over several days going unanswered.

Although the allegations in Binhu are extreme, land grabs are not uncommon. According to Li, local authorities across China derive between 20 and 90 percent of their income from selling expropriated land.

Land disputes are one of the main causes of the tens of thousands of protests across China each year. Most go unreported, although some, like a revolt in the southern village of Wukan in 2011, have attracted a high profile and prompted promises of action by Beijing.

Just last Thursday, a four-year-old girl was killed by a bulldozer that was razing her home during a land grab in the southeastern province of Fujian, local media reported.

HEAVY INVESTMENT

Following 30 years of stellar double-digit growth, China's economy in maturing.

But policymakers are struggling to shift gears and allow consumption, not investment, to power activity at a time when strong economic expansion is needed to repay some 9.7 trillion yuan ($1.6 trillion) that local governments borrowed from banks.

Much of China's massive fiscal stimulus after the 2008/09 financial crisis was funded by these bank loans, and investors worry that a hefty chunk of them may sour, having mostly paid for non-lucrative public works such as sewage systems.

A 30-minute train ride north of Shanghai, Jiangsu is China's wealthiest province and an exemplar of the country's old export-led growth model. Investment was worth 59 percent of Jiangsu's economy in 2012.

The local authorities envision turning Wuxi into a center for information and technology, a Chinese answer to Silicon Valley that will move its factories up the value chain.

Yet that dream of a new economy, built around a vast software park the size of 3,500 football fields in south Binhu, still hinges on large state investment.

Authorities have not revealed the cost, but Wuxi Taihu International Technology Park Investment Development, a firm belonging to the Wuxi government and the main financier of "T-Park", is in financial throes.

Public records show it suffered negative operating cash flows every year in the last four years, with outflows hitting 762 million yuan in 2012. It has total debt of 5.9 billion yuan - or a 10th of Wuxi's 2012 fiscal revenues - and has been hit by cash shortfalls, analysts from Chinese rating agency CCXI said.

"The firm has a strong public service element and a weak earning power," CCXI said in a note, noting that its ability to repay investors depends on how much cash the government raises from selling land.

Public records show the Wuxi government has at least three other financing firms that raise debt on its behalf. Two of these firms had negative net operating cash flows of between 0.4 billion yuan and 4.8 billion yuan every year from 2009 to 2011.

Investments by the Wuxi and Jiangsu governments have ended badly before. They led a rapid expansion in the province's shipbuilding and solar panel industries into some of the world's biggest over the last decade. But over-zealous investment created excess capacity, and both sectors now nurse huge losses.

BEATINGS, THREATS

To make way for T-Park, the Binhu government cleared farms and relocated residents, who were given new housing. To pay for the homes, authorities sold 1 billion yuan worth of bonds last year through Wuxi Taihu International.

But the cost of mass relocation has taken its toll, just as governments' tax income is also sliding. Officials in a town in Binhu tried to dock the salaries of some civil servants last year but quickly retracted the plan, residents said.

An online copy of the notice announcing the plan to dock wages said the government faced "arduous and heavy" relocation work and was under "huge financial pressure".

Xu, whose demolished home lay to the west of T-Park, said the government had offered to buy her house and land for 2.4 million yuan, or around 4,140 yuan per square meter. An online search showed new houses in the area are currently selling for between 10,100 yuan to 17,840 yuan per square meter.

Things turned ugly, Xu said, when she rejected the offer. Officials cut her water and electricity supply and Xu and her husband were threatened and beaten.

"One of them called and he claimed to be Hu Jintao," Xu said, referring to a man harassing her family. Hu is China's former president. "He said 'I am Hu Jintao'. So what if we are demolishing your home? What can you do?'"

Xu said her husband eventually signed the deal under threat, but the family has only received 1 million yuan in compensation. Their house was torn down by a work crew hired by the government for 200 yuan and a pack of cigarettes each, her husband said.

The family owned several houses in their village before they were relocated and have received eight smaller apartments from the government in compensation.

But Xu said the apartments did not come with property deeds, and the 580-square-metre (6,240 sq ft) house that was their family home and most valuable asset has not been properly accounted for.

Elsewhere in Binhu, similar accusations abound. A group of five residents in the next village said authorities refused to recognize property deeds dated before 1979, when China's modern economy was created, and those homes were razed without compensation. Some said the government told them they own too many homes and that it cannot afford to pay for them all.

At least 41 Chinese have set themselves on fire to protest land grabs since 2009, Amnesty said in a report last year.

"You have to generate growth if you are a local government official," said Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong. "The easiest way of doing that is flipping land."



headline: France says pension reform enough for several years
byline: By Catherine Bremer and Emmanuel Jarry
6:20pm EDT

The minister in charge of France's pension reform says her proposals are robust enough to tide the system over for several years at least, even if economic growth falls short of expectations.

Health and Social Affairs Minister Marisol Touraine, whose pension law is set to go to parliament in October, told Reuters that while the plan may appear less bold than a 2010 move under conservative Nicolas Sarkozy to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62, the Socialist reform would be a lasting one.

The overhaul would gradually extend the mandatory pay-in period from 41.5 years to 43 by 2035 and requires workers, retirees and employers to fill in an annual deficit set otherwise to reach 20 billion euros ($26 billion) in 2020.

Analysts say the planned reform, the most closely watched of President Francois Hollande's 15 months in office, does not go far enough because it only slightly accelerates a lengthening in the pay-in period that is already in place.

The European Commission, which recommended tougher measures such as trimming inflation-linked annual pension rises, sounded a note of disappointment when the draft reform was unveiled last week and said it needed to evaluate it in detail.

But crucially, Touraine says, a steering committee would revise the pension system annually and make recommendations to the government if a shortfall in contributions caused by slow growth or a rise in unemployment needed addressing.

"This is not a stopgap reform. It puts in place measures that are destined to last," Touraine said in an interview.

"I'm not going to say it's the last reform. Who can say what will be necessary in 2035 or 2040? I am just saying that we are doing what's needed to get through the coming years."

SLOWLY BUT SURELY

Hollande has used modest, step-by-step reforms to try to bolster France's flagging competitiveness. While his pace of action has disappointed critics, government advisers say that going gently has so far ensured minimal opposition in parliament and on the street.

In contrast, Sarkozy's hike in the retirement age sparked weeks of large-scale street protests and fuel strikes.

"An acceptable reform is one that is not brutal," Touraine said. "We are not doing this to satisfy the demands of Brussels, we're doing it to reassure the French people, because not reforming would threaten the future of our pensions."

The European Commission has given France an extra two years to bring its public deficit below an EU ceiling of 3 percent of economic output, but said in return it wanted to see meaningful change in a country where spending on pensions and welfare is among the highest in the bloc.

Touraine's draft reform has the pension deficit falling steadily over the next few years to show a small surplus in 2030 and stand at balance in 2040, based on a medium-term growth average of 2 percent a year or slightly less.

Touraine said critics who see the reform needing revisiting if growth disappoints have overlooked the role of the steering committee, which she said would play a similar role to the state auditor's regular prodding of the government on public finances.

She also noted France's demographic advantage, with a high birth rate that will ease the pension squeeze in coming years.

"It's not an accounting reform that just realigns columns of figures. It's a structural reform that guarantees the system's long-term financing," she said.

The government is still figuring out where it will find the extra 1 billion-2 billion euros a year it needs to finance cuts to labor costs it has promised companies to compensate them for slightly higher pension contributions, Touraine said.

The government will also tweak the balance of spending cuts to taxes in its upcoming 2014 balance, she said, after it said last week that a plan for 14 billion of cuts to 6 billion in taxes would be altered to ease the tax burden.

"As growth is recovering earlier than we expected, we can limit taxes. But savings are always necessary," she said. ($1 = 0.7584 euros)



headline: UK's 'reckless' Cameron pays political price for Syria vote loss
byline: By Andrew Osborn
6:20pm EDT

British Prime Minister David Cameron's failure to win parliamentary backing for military action against Syria has hurt him politically, polls showed on Monday, with most Britons thinking him "reckless" and support for his party falling.

A Comres/ITV poll showed that 59 percent of those asked thought he had been reckless to organize last Thursday's vote on military action without knowing whether he had lawmakers' backing.

Another poll showed the opposition Labour party had increased its lead over Cameron's ruling Conservatives to 10 from four percentage points after the parliamentary defeat, setting back his hopes of being re-elected in 2015.

"The ten point lead is larger than we have seen of late, suggesting at least some impact from the Syria vote," YouGov, the second poll's organizer, said on Monday.

Britain's lower house of parliament voted against Cameron's Syrian plans by 285 to 272 votes on Thursday, inflicting a shock defeat on him even though he had already made big concessions to try to win approval.

It had long been clear that most Britons opposed their country being involved in military action against Syria and did not agree with Cameron, but Monday's polls suggest they think he badly mismanaged the overall situation too.

Cameron's office has ruled out a re-run of the Syria vote despite pressure from some senior lawmakers to do so, saying that "parliament has spoken" with ministers keen to blame Labour for sabotaging the vote, an accusation Labour dismisses.

Commentators say both parties want to avoid a repeat. In Cameron's case, losing another vote on Syria could trigger a leadership challenge against him, something that a significant minority in his fractious party would welcome.

Many politicians and commentators have also expressed fears that Cameron's defeat could damage Britain's 'special relationship' with the United States given that President Barack Obama had asked for and not got British military support.

However, another poll showed most Britons did not share that fear. The survey, by the BBC, showed that 72 percent of those asked did not think UK-U.S. ties would be harmed, and two thirds of respondents would not care if they were.



headline: Assad warns of retaliation as France builds case for Syria attack
byline: By John Irish and Catherine Bremer
6:20pm EDT

Assad warned Syria would retaliate if France takes part in foreign strikes on his forces, while Paris said it had intelligence proving Assad had ordered chemical attacks and was determined to punish him.

"If the policies of the French state are hostile to the Syrian people, the state will be their enemy," Assad said in an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro. "There will be repercussions, negative ones obviously, on French interests."

France has backed Syrian rebels since the start of the two-and-a-half year old civil war. It fears the violence may spill into Lebanon, where about 20,000 French citizens live, many French companies operate and where France has an 800-strong contingent of U.N. peacekeepers.

President Francois Hollande, along with U.S. President Barack Obama, has said Assad should be punished for an attack on August 21 in which Washington says more than 1,400 people were killed, many of them children. The Syrian government says it was carried out by rebels.

Assad said it would have made no sense to use chemical weapons in an area where his troops were also fighting.

"Those who make accusations must show evidence. We have challenged the United States and France to come up with a single piece of proof. Obama and Hollande have been incapable of doing so," said Assad, according to extracts of the interview published on Monday.

The prospect of an imminent Western strike on Syria has receded since Britain's parliament last week voted against taking part in any action against Syria and Obama decided to seek the approval of Congress before any assault.

France, whose president has the constitutional right to make war, remains a forceful advocate of Western military action.

On Monday, senior members of Hollande's ruling party rebuffed opposition calls for a parliamentary vote to approve any attack.

After presenting an intelligence report on the chemical attack to lawmakers on Monday, French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault appeared as determined as ever to use force against Assad, saying Paris wanted to prevent him from using such weapons again and dissuade others from copying him.

"This act cannot be left without a response," Ayrault said. "It's not for France to act alone. The president is continuing his work of persuasion to bring together a coalition.

"The objective is neither to topple the regime nor liberate the country." he said.

"POWDER KEG"

The nine-page intelligence document drawn up by France's military and foreign intelligence services and made public late on Monday listed points suggesting Assad's fighters were behind the "massive and coordinated" chemical attack on August 21.

It said the opposition had neither the know-how nor the experience to carry it out.

"This (the attack) poses a major threat to national and global security," a French official told Reuters ahead of the report's release.

Satellite imagery showed strikes came from government-controlled areas to the east and west of the Syrian capital and targeting rebel-held zones, just before civilians began dying from gas poisoning, the official said.

Later, the neighborhoods where the strikes were launched were bombed and fires lit purposefully to wipe out evidence, said the official.

"Unlike previous attacks that used small amounts of chemicals and were aimed at terrorizing people, this attack was tactical and aimed at regaining territory," the official said.

According to the intelligence report, aerial and artillery conventional bombing took place between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. in the Damascus suburb of East Gouta.

In parallel, the areas of Zamalka, Kafr Batna and Ayn Tarma were hit with chemical attacks and at 6 a.m. a ground offensive was launched by the regime in those areas, the report said.

"Our services have information ... that suggests other acts of this nature could be carried out," it said.

In the interview in Le Figaro, Assad said the Middle East was a powder keg and a Western attack on Syria could push the entire region into chaos.

"We shouldn't just talk about a Syrian response, but what will happen after the first strike," Assad said. "Everybody will lose control of the situation when the powder keg blows. There is a risk of a regional war."

headline: Shippers brace for more Suez turmoil after vessel attack
byline: By Jonathan Saul
6:20pm EDT

An attack by assailants on a container ship in the Suez canal has heightened risks for merchant shipping using the vital waterway, with further threats considered likely as political turmoil continues in Egypt.

On Sunday an army source said three people had been arrested after opening fire with machine guns on a Chinese-owned container ship passing through the canal, a big source of revenue for Egypt, playing down what the Suez Canal Authority's chief had described earlier as a terrorist attack.

This is the first incident confirmed by officials involving a ship in Suez. In July the army said it had investigated reports of an explosion near the canal but found no evidence.

Egypt is currently governed under a state of emergency after the army deposed the country's first freely elected president, Mohamed Mursi, two months ago, in response to huge street protests against his rule.

At least 900 people, most of them Islamist supporters of Mursi, have been killed since the army took over and cleared protest camps calling for his reinstatement.

Any major attack on the canal would further hammer Egypt's economy, which benefits from about $5 billion a year in tolls for using the 192-kilometre (120 mile) waterway, the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe.

"The transit of vessels through Suez has long been of concern to many. The proximity to land throughout much of the transit makes it an attractive target," said David Welch, of bomb disposal and counter-terrorism specialists Ramora UK.

"I would suggest that an attack on any primary sea line of communication or critical port would be high on the agenda of many terrorist groups. Imagine the chaos if they managed to disable or sink a large vessel across the canal."

An Egyptian security source told Reuters on Monday the attack on the ship appeared to be down to individuals, rather than an organization.

"We do not have information on the existence of an organization that is targeting the movement of ships in the Suez canal," the source said. "The available information confirms that some elements ... were aiming to target the Suez canal as it is a vital and international facility and any incident there would have a large impact internationally."

GROWING THREATS

The Egyptian source said such an incident could happen again despite intense security along the canal, adding that residential areas could be used to move light weapons around without detection.

"Security officials have highlighted apparent threats to the canal and its land-based facilities over recent months," said Alan Fraser of security firm AKE.

"Security has been increased around major public assets in Egypt recently, although there is potential for further attacks over the coming months."

The Panamanian-registered container ship COSCO Asia came under fire in a northern section of the canal on Saturday. The head of the Suez Canal, Mohab Memish, had said a terrorist carried out the operation, suggesting Islamist militants could have been behind it. Suez Canal Authority sources said a rocket-propelled grenade had been used in the attack.

"The attack on the Cosco Asia by terrorists, most likely foreigners or Egyptians working with foreigners from bases in north east Sinai, tells us that similar attacks by other foreign terrorists or Egyptians working with them, attacks launched by the land and meant to disrupt international commerce, are possible and can be successful," said Michael Frodl of U.S.-based consultancy C-Level Maritime Risks.

Egypt has faced a rising number of militant attacks on security forces in the nearby lawless North Sinai region since Mursi's ouster.

A spokesman for Maersk, the world's number one container line, said its activities in Suez remained unchanged, "while we keep monitoring the situation and pay close attention to any updates or recommendations from local authorities".

A spokesman with marine insurance managers Thomas Miller said separately: "We would advise all ships transiting that area to maintain a constant security watch."

The Joint War Committee (JWC), which groups syndicate members from the Lloyd's Market Association (LMA) as well as representatives from London's insurance company market, said it was reviewing the situation.

The JWC's list of high-risk areas, closely watched by marine insurers and risk assessors, has been extended to date as far as Eritrea in the Red Sea due to piracy threats.

"We are looking for more information about whether this (attack) is indicative of a trend or not and whether this has been carried out by an individual or a group. We would not be looking to amend anything until we have more details," LMA senior executive Neil Roberts said on Monday.

"Currently Egypt/Suez are not on the listed areas, so only renewals and new business could be affected."

led coalition forces.

Adam Griffiths was the first British military witness to give oral evidence about the allegations made by dozens of Iraqis, which if confirmed by the Al-Sweady Inquiry would go down as one of the worst atrocities of the Iraq war.

More than 200 British soldiers will appear in coming months before the inquiry, named after Hamid Al-Sweady, one of 20 Iraqi men who died in disputed circumstances at or after a battle near the southern Iraqi town of Majar al-Kabir on May 14, 2004.

The aim is to establish whether the 20 men died on the battlefield, as the British say, or whether they were captured alive and later executed and mutilated at a British military camp, as relatives and members of the local community allege.

The soldiers involved deny separate allegations by five men detained after the battle that they were tortured.

"The rumors were baseless and caused by a combination of ignorance amongst the local population as to the traumatic injuries that can be suffered in combat, and the misinformation spread by insurgents who wished to discredit the coalition forces," Griffiths told the inquiry in a witness statement.

Sixty Iraqi witnesses testified from March to June, some of whom alleged they had seen corpses with eyes gouged out, severed genitals and other signs of torture or mutilation.

"I did not observe anything that appeared to be inconsistent with battlefield injuries," Griffiths told the inquiry.

"I can recall that some of the limbs must have been broken as they were sticking out at unnatural angles," he said, adding such injuries could be caused by the weapons used in the battle.

A major at the time who was the officer commanding the company involved, Griffiths is not personally suspected of execution or torture. He still serves in the British army and has the rank of colonel.

BODIES REMOVED

The disputed events took place the day after the Imam Ali mosque in Najaf, Shi'ite Islam's holiest shrine, was damaged during fighting between U.S. troops and radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia.

With anger against foreign troops running high because of the Najaf incident, fighting broke out between a British convoy and armed insurgents on a road near Majar al-Kabir. Griffiths said the insurgents had staged several coordinated ambushes.

Several bodies were recovered by local people on the battlefield, but another 20 were handed over by the British the following day at Camp Abu Naji, a nearby army base. It was from that point that allegations of atrocities surfaced.

The military say the 20 died fighting and their bodies were taken to the camp to check whether any of them were among suspects who were wanted over the killing of six British military police in Majar al-Kabir in an incident in June 2003.

The issue of the removal of the bodies from the battlefield is central to the inquiry because it was a very unusual event that caused confusion and could be a potential explanation for why the circumstances of the deaths came to be disputed.

Pressed to explain why and how the bodies were taken to the camp, Griffiths told the inquiry the order had come from higher up the chain of command. He said he had never received such an order before or since.

"We just did it because there must have been a reason for it," he said, adding that he had not been told at the time the reason for the order by the officer who relayed it to him.

"I would have said 'why' and he would have said 'just get on with it'," Griffiths said.

The military evidence is scheduled to last until early next year and the report from the inquiry is expected in late 2014.

The inquiry has no power to prosecute. However, depending on what it concludes, the Service Prosecuting Authority which is in charge of military justice could decide to launch prosecutions.

6:20pm EDT

Senior members of France's ruling party rebuffed opposition calls for a parliamentary vote on whether to take military action against Syria, saying on Monday lawmakers should respect the president's constitutional right to decide on attacks.

President Francois Hollande's demands for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to be punished for an alleged chemical strike have left him out on a limb since Britain's parliament voted against taking part in any action and U.S. President Barack Obama said he would seek Congress approval before any assault.

Hollande is the army's commander in chief under the French constitution and empowered to order an intervention. His sole obligation is to inform parliament within three days of action starting.

Only if it were to last more than four months would he be obliged to seek parliamentary approval for it to continue.

With opinion polls showing up to two-thirds of the public would oppose an intervention in Syria, several conservative, centrist and green politicians called over the weekend for France to hold a special parliamentary vote.

Health and Social Affairs Minister Marisol Touraine told Reuters there was no reason to do that. "There is a framework and we must respect it," she said. "The issue is too serious to be opened up to political posturing."

"In a complicated situation like this, we need to stick to principles, in other words the constitution, which does not oblige the president to hold a vote, nor even a debate," foreign affairs committee chief Elisabeth Guigou, a veteran of the ruling Socialist Party, told France Info radio.

"I don't see that holding a vote would make any sense politically," she said, noting France would be left in an impossible situation if parliament voted in favor of action and then the U.S. Congress voted against.

Interior Minister Manuel Valls also said over the weekend that the constitution should be respected.

But Alain Juppe, foreign minister under conservative ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, said a vote was needed because the U.N. Security Council had not backed any attack on Syria.

"We're in a specific context here ... It would justify a vote in parliament," he said.

PM TO UNVEIL INTELLIGENCE

Parliament is due to debate the Syria crisis on Wednesday.

The last time parliament voted on military action was in 1991 when then-Socialist president Francois Mitterrand sought its support for his decision to join the U.S.-led coalition in the Gulf War.

Guigou said doing nothing would signal to all authoritarian rulers that using chemical weapons against civilians can go unpunished. She acknowledged France would not act on its own.

"To give an intervention legality it would need to be carried out by a broad coalition," she said.

Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told reporters he would show parliament leaders evidence in a meeting on Monday proving that Assad's forces used chemical weapons" on in an attack on August 21 which Washington says killed over 1,400 people.

A declassified French intelligence document published by the weekly Le Journal du Dimanche and confirmed as authentic by a government official said Syria's chemical weapons arsenal included sarin, VX nerve agent and mustard gas.

Syria had about 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, one of the world's largest such arsenals, it said. The agents could be delivered with long-range missiles, aerial bombardments or short-range artillery, it added.

A BVA opinion poll released on Saturday showed 64 percent of respondents opposed taking military action in Syria, 58 percent did not trust Hollande to conduct an operation and 35 percent feared that strikes could set the Middle East "ablaze".

headline: USS Nimitz carrier group sails into Red Sea in 'prudent' move
byline: By Andrea Shalal-Esa
6:20pm EDT

The USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and four other ships in its strike group moved into the Red Sea early on Monday, U.S. defense officials said, describing the move as "prudent planning" in case the ships are needed for military action against Syria.

The officials said the Nimitz entered the Red Sea around 6 a.m. EDT (1000 GMT), but the strike group had not received any orders to move into the Mediterranean, where five U.S. destroyers and an amphibious ship, the USS San Antonio, remain poised for possible cruise missile strikes against Syria.

Moving the Nimitz into the Red Sea was aimed at putting more U.S. assets in place if they are needed to support what U.S. officials still describe as a limited attack against Syria after it used chemical weapons against civilians.

"It does place that strike group in a position to respond to a variety of contingencies," said one official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.

The nuclear-powered Nimitz is accompanied by the Princeton, a cruiser, and three destroyers - the William P. Lawrence, Stockdale and Shoup, according to the officials.

They said there had been no change regarding six U.S. Navy ships now in the eastern Mediterranean, but military planners were reassessing the situation given a delay in the cruise missile strikes that had been expected this past weekend.

President Barack Obama on Saturday backed off imminent strikes by the destroyers off the coast of Syria until Congress had time to vote its approval. Defense officials said the delay gave them more time to reassess which ships and other weapons will be kept in the region - and whether some may be allowed to leave. Congress returns to Washington September 9.

The U.S. Navy doubled its presence in the eastern Mediterranean in the past week, effectively adding two destroyers to the three that generally patrol the region, and diverting the San Antonio, which carries four massive CH-53 helicopters and 300 Marines, from another mission.

Two of the destroyers were due to be relieved but are now serving along with the ships that were to replace them.

PRUDENT DEPLOYMENT

It was not immediately clear how long those ships would be asked to remain in the eastern Mediterranean, but officials suggested that changes could be made to the current fleet there in coming days.

The destroyers are carrying a combined load of about 200 Tomahawk missiles, but officials say a limited strike on Syria could be accomplished with half that number.

Retired Admiral Gary Roughead, who served as chief of naval operations during the 2011 strikes on Libya, said the Navy's decision to move the carrier into the Red Sea meant it was closer to the "points of tension."

"It's a prudent move that provides for maximum naval flexibility in the region," Roughead, who is now a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, told Reuters. "It is not unusual to move carriers around in North Arabian Sea and Red Sea as events dictate."

Reuters reported Sunday that officials had rerouted the Nimitz carrier group, which was due to sail east around Asia to return to its home port in Everett, Washington, after being relieved in recent days by another aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman.

Officials said the USS Kearsarge, a large-deck amphibious ship, remained in North Arabian Sea, and there were no plans to move the ship into the Red Sea.

The Kearsarge, which carries 6 AV-8B Harriers, 10-12 V-22 Ospreys and helicopters, played a key role in the 2011 strikes on Libya. Two Ospreys launched from the ship helped rescue a downed F-15 pilot during that operation.

byline: By Sherilee Lakmidas and Ed Stoddard
6:20pm EDT

South African union leaders warned on Monday, a day before a strike in the gold sector, that mine owners' handling of pay talks could provoke violence, and bosses said wage hikes would force mine closures and cost thousands of jobs.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which represents about two-thirds of more than 120,000 unionized gold miners in Africa's biggest economy, is set to strike from Tuesday.

With stoppages in the auto industry and the construction sector already sapping the struggling economy, shutting gold mines could cripple an industry that has produced a third of the world's bullion but is now in rapid decline.

Labor and management are poles apart on the issue of wages, with the NUM seeking 60 percent pay hikes for entry-level miners and its more hardline rival, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), pushing for 150 percent raises.

Companies say they cannot afford this in the face of soaring costs and depressed prices. The president of South Africa's Chamber of Mines warned unions against stoking workers' hopes.

Mark Cutifani, who is also chief executive of mining giant Anglo American said, "Promoting expectations above the capacity of the industry to pay is a dangerous road that may have tragic consequences for employees who do not understand how close we are to economic devastation in certain sectors."

"If we lose each other in the present discussions, we will count the costs in mines closed and tens of thousands of jobs lost," he wrote in a commentary in the Business Day newspaper.

South Africa's gold and platinum sectors are still recovering from a wave of violent, wildcat strikes last year. Stemming from a turf war between the NUM and AMCU, it cost billions of dollars in lost output and triggered damaging sovereign credit downgrades. More than 50 people were killed.

emptive lockout at the mines. The Chamber of Mines, which negotiates on behalf of firms, told Reuters a lockout was an option but it would be taken as a "last resort".

AMCU President Joseph Mathunjwa, whose union has not yet called a strike, said a mines lockout would provoke trouble.

"I have informed the minister of police that the manner in which the gold CEOs want to approach this wage negotiation, through an offensive lockout, will result in violence," he said.

"A strike is not what we are after, we are being pushed into a corner," Mathunjwa said.

FALLEN GOLD GIANT

Critics say President Jacob Zuma and his ruling African National Congress (ANC) have paid more attention to a small and wealthy business elite, including mine bosses, and ignored the needs of South Africa's working class, poor and unemployed.

The government is anxious to keep a lid on labor unrest and potential job losses before elections next year.

A gold industry shutdown could cost South Africa more than $35 million a day in lost output, according to calculations based on the spot gold price and a Chamber of Mines estimate that the sector would stop producing about 760 kg a day.

South Africa's gold industry, which once accounted for almost 80 percent of global bullion output, now produces just 6 percent of the world total.

It has been laid low by a combination of geological and economic setbacks. After more than a century of mining, the remaining ore lies deep underground and is costly and dangerous to extract. Labor and power costs have also soared.

Monday brought some relief however from the strike pressure, when workers at petrol stations and car dealerships postponed for a week a stoppage which was scheduled to start on Monday.

But striking car manufacturing workers stayed away from work after rejecting a double-digit wage increase offer on Thursday. The auto industry strike is costing the economy an estimated $60 million a day.

Labor worries pushed the rand to four-year lows last month.

Companies which will be hit by Tuesday's strike include main gold producers AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold and Sibanye Gold.

byline: By Sarah Marsh
6:20pm EDT

SS, Adolf Hitler's elite Nazi troops, goes on trial on Monday in the western city of Hagen on charges of having shot in the back and killed a Dutch resistance fighter at the end of World War Two.

Although an international military tribunal put some of the most infamous Nazi leaders on trial soon after World War Two in the Nuremburg Trials, Germany has a patchy record on bringing its Nazi war criminals to justice.

In the last few years, however, prosecutors in some parts of Germany have actively sought out some of the last survivors.

In an televised interview with broadcaster Das Erste, Siert Bruins says he was present at the murder of Aldert Klaas Dijkema but says another soldier, now dead, shot him.

"I walked on the right (of Dijkema), he was on the left, then suddenly I heard the shots and someone fell," he said.

The Hagen court already sentenced the Dutch-born accused, who acquired German citizenship while serving as a German security and border guard in the Netherlands during World War Two, to seven years in jail in 1980 for being accessory to the murder of two Jewish brothers in April 1945.

Monday's trial deals with the murder of Dutch citizen Dijkema in 1944 who was suspected of working for the resistance against German occupation of the Netherlands.

"The accused is alleged to have taken Mr. Dijkema on the orders of his superior ... in a car near to a factory," the court wrote in a statement. "There, the accused and his accomplice are alleged to have shot Mr. Dijkema four times."

"He was hit in the back of his head among other places and died immediately. Later on, the accused and his accomplice admitted that Mr. Dijkema was shot as he tried to flee."

The trial is expected to extend over 11 hearings until the end of September.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center launched in July "Operation Last Chance II", a campaign to root out surviving Nazi war criminals and bring them to justice before they die.

Nazi-hunters have been encouraged by the prosecution in June in Hungary of 98-year-old Laszlo Csatary for helping to deport Jews to Auschwitz and by the arrest in Germany of Hans Lipschis, a suspected former guard at the Auschwitz concentration camp. He died last month while awaiting trial.

The hunt is no longer for high-level perpetrators of the Holocaust, in which some 6 million Jews were murdered, but for thousands of people who helped in the machine of death.

Many Germans are keen to draw a line under the Holocaust and seal the post-war democratic identity of their nation. Some find distasteful the pursuit of old men, often in poor health, for crimes committed nearly 70 years ago.

Others say that it is never too late and prosecution helps to fight those who still engage in denial and distortion of the Holocaust.

Cambodian staff at a Khmer Rouge war crimes tribunal went on strike on Monday, an official said, as a funding crisis deepened at a court already bogged down by resignations, political interference and the frail health of its elderly defendants.

Some 250 Cambodians have not been paid since June at the U.N.-backed court, caught up in a standoff between donors and a government criticized for its lack of support for hearings into one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century.

The national component of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) had a shortfall of $3 million in its annual budget, said court spokesman Neth Pheaktra.

About 100 went on strike and would not return until they had been paid, he said.

Up to 2.2 million people died under the ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 to 1979, about a quarter of the population, many through hard labor, torture or execution.

Under the agreement for the tribunal, the United Nations was to pay for international staff and operations, while Cambodia paid for the national side, but the government has been repeatedly criticized for its lack of support.

"We are very concerned about the possible risk of disruption to the judicial process through the strike by national staff," said U.N. spokesman Lars Olsen.

The funding dispute puts the spotlight on the commitment of the government, which has been accused of interfering behind the scenes to undermine the court and limit the scope of investigations that could implicate powerful political figures.

The court, dogged from the outset by allegations of corruption, political interference and profligacy, had spent $175.3 million by the end of last year.

It has only convicted one prisoner, former prison chief Kaing Guek Eav, alias "Duch", who was jailed for life for the deaths of more than 14,000 people.

The government said on Monday that it had already contributed $16.9 million to the court.

"If the ECCC is going to fail just because of a budget shortfall, the failure of the court is the failure of the United Nations, the failure of the Cambodian government and the failure of the international community as the whole," government spokesman Ek Tha said.

"We hope the international community will not stand and watch."

run case that sparked nationwide outrage.

Vorayuth Yoovidhya, 28, is accused of being behind the wheel of his Ferrari sports car when it collided with an on-duty policeman in the early hours of September 3, 2012.

"Investigators will issue an arrest warrant for the suspect tomorrow and he can be arrested anywhere in Thailand," said Reuchai Krairerk, a senior public prosecutor at the Bangkok South Criminal Court.

Vorayuth faces charges of causing death through reckless driving and failing to stop and assist the victim. An additional charge for speeding was dropped as the legal time frame within which to press the charge expires on Tuesday.

Vorayuth, nicknamed "Boss", left Thailand on Thursday for a business trip, said his lawyer, and was unable to travel back to hear the charges against him.

"He suddenly fell ill which made it impossible for him to travel back today," said lawyer Tanit Buakeaw, adding that Vorayuth planned to return to Thailand within three days and would cooperate with prosecutors.

The Yoovidhyas, ranked Thailand's fourth-richest family in 2013 by Forbes magazine, paid the victim's family $97,000 (62,275 pounds) after the accident, police said.

The case prompted a backlash in online forums where people questioned the justice system and its leniency towards those with money and connections.

Some asked why Thais turn a blind eye to the practice of handing out a so-called "funeral fee" or hush money in return for families agreeing to drop civil suits.

Vorayuth is the grandson of the late Chaleo Yoovidhya, who rose from poverty to become one of Thailand's richest men.

Chaleo formulated an energy drink called Krathing Daeng, or Red Bull, that proved popular among laborers and in 1987 he went into business with Austrian Dietrich Mateschitz who helped turn Red Bull into the world's most popular energy drink.

Chaleo, who died in March 2012, left his heirs a 49 percent stake in the drinks brand.

headline: Japan vows quick action, public funds for Fukushima
byline: By Sumio Ito and Mari Saito
6:20pm EDT

Japan vowed quick, decisive action, including the use of public funds, to tackle the worsening problem of contaminated water pouring from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, as the authorities step in to help the facility's embattled operator.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government "will step forward and implement all necessary policies" to deal with the flood of radioactive water from the plant, a legacy of the world's worst atomic disaster in a quarter century.

The government will present a "comprehensive package of measures" on the water problem as soon as Tuesday, a senior official said.

Tokyo's measures come amid proposals to create a government agency devoted to decommissioning the Fukushima plant and as some outside the government call for a break-up of the operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co, or Tepco.

Two and a half years after a massive earthquake and tsunami crippled the facility, the problem of contaminated water is only getting worse, and the government is taking a more direct role as Tepco appears overwhelmed by the task.

"The government has stayed in the background and extended support for Tokyo Electric's effort to tackle the problem of contaminated water. But we've now decided that Tokyo Electric's patchwork response has reached its limit, and the government needs to come forward and quickly respond, even by using budget reserves," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters.

Tepco, rushing to contain the crisis from the steady accumulation of water used to cool melted fuel rods, said at the weekend that radiation near a tank holding highly contaminated water at the plant had spiked to 18 times the initial reading, a level that could kill an unprotected person in four hours.

This follows the utility's admission late last month, a reversal previous denials, that large amounts of contaminated water were flowing into the Pacific Ocean from the coastal facility 230 kms (140 miles) northeast of Tokyo.

OLYMPIC BID

Japan's nuclear industry, which once provided a third of the nation's power, has ground nearly to a halt since the quake hit the Fukushima plant in March 2011, causing reactor meltdowns. Restarting Japan's off-line reactors, and reducing the nation's reliance on foreign energy supplies, is a key element of Abe's economic growth plans and a pillar of Tepco's turnaround plan.

Japanese officials also fear that international attention to the Fukushima crisis could threaten Tokyo's bid to host the 2020 Olympics, a decision set to be made by the International Olympic Committee on Saturday in Buenos Aires.

The government will present a package of measures as soon as Tuesday to a taskforce dealing with the contaminated water problem, officials said. The steps will include using existing budgetary funds.

Japan's nuclear regulator reiterated on Monday that it may have to consider discharging water with radiation below regulatory limits into the ocean. Tepco has been pumping water over the wrecked reactors to keep them cool and storing the radioactive waste water as well as contaminated ground water in ever-growing numbers of above-ground tanks.

Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) Chairman Shunichi Tanaka told reporters there was no evidence of new water leaks at the Fukushima plant, following the discovery of high radiation levels in recent days.

Still, he said, "The people at the Fukushima plant have been dealing with the post-accident situation with haphazard, stop-gap measures for several years." Tanaka said the NRA has instructed plant officials to foresee possible risks and take action as quickly as possible to mitigate them.

DECOMMISSIONING AGENCY

More broadly, policymakers may be moving toward even greater intervention in the ongoing response to the nuclear disaster.

Yasuhisa Shiozaki, deputy policy chief of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and head of its project team on nuclear regulation, called for the creation of a "decommissioning agency." He also urged the merging of the NRA with the Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization, a body that provides engineering experts and inspects Japan's nuclear facilities.

Giving Tokyo direct oversight of Fukushima, a decommissioning agency could resemble Britain's National Decommissioning Authority, a public body charged with managing the dismantling of the nation's atomic power and research stations.

"It is an urgent task to promptly restructure our overall nuclear power policies under a resolute system and revive domestic and international trust," Shiozaki said in comments posted on his website.

Debate has also emerged over nationalizing or breaking up Tepco to put the Fukushima reactors directly under official control.

Tepco, Japan's largest utility, last year got a 1 trillion yen ($10.2 billion) injection of tax money in exchange for giving the government a de facto controlling stake, but management has been left to the company. The firm also receives public funds - in theory to be paid back - to help compensate residents forced to flee after the 2011 disaster.

weary American public.

Obama made a series of calls to members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with more scheduled for Monday, underscoring the task confronting the administration before it can go ahead with using force in response to a deadly chemical attack blamed on the Syrian government.

Dozens of lawmakers, some in tennis shirts or shirtsleeves, cut short their vacations and streamed into the corridors of the Capitol building for a Sunday afternoon intelligence briefing on Syria with Obama's national security team.

When they emerged nearly three hours later, there was no immediate sign that the many skeptics in Congress had changed their minds.

"I am very concerned about taking America into another war against a country that hasn't attacked us," said Representative Janice Hahn, a California Democrat. On the way out of the briefing, she said the participants appeared "evenly divided" on whether to give Obama approval.

None expressed doubts that Syria had engaged in chemical warfare. "The searing image of babies lined up dead, that's what I can't get out of my mind right now," Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz said after the closed-door briefing.

But the credibility of the administration's intelligence is turning out to be a less important issue than the nature and usefulness of the response.

Earlier in the day, Secretary of State John Kerry invoked the crimes of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein and warned of a potential threat to Israel a day after Obama's decision to delay an imminent attack on Syrian targets and allow Congress to vote on it first.

Even as Kerry took to the airwaves touting new evidence that deadly sarin gas was used in the August 21 chemical attack near Damascus, the scope of the challenge confronting the administration became apparent.

Lawmakers raised a broad array of concerns, including the potential effectiveness of limited strikes, the possible unintended consequence of dragging the United States into another open-ended Middle East conflict, the wisdom of acting without broader international backing to share the burden and the war fatigue of the American public.

Many in Congress have been able to avoid taking a position on the merits of a military strike, focusing instead on demands that Obama consult them and seek their approval.

While Kerry predicted Obama would win the endorsement he wants, a growing cacophony of congressional critics - ranging from liberal Democratic doves to Republican Tea Party conservatives - illustrated just how hard that will be.

At the same time, Kerry, the administration's most impassioned voice for intervention in Syria's 2-1/2-year civil war, was left to publicly defend Obama's stunning reversal, a decision that puts any strike on hold for at least nine days.

"This is squarely now in the hands of Congress," Kerry told CNN, saying he had confidence "they will do what is right because they understand the stakes."

In a round of television appearances, Kerry declined to say whether Obama would go ahead with military action if Congress rejects the president's request, as Britain's parliament did last week to derail London's role in any Syria military operation.

But, echoing Obama's comments in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, he insisted the president had the right to act on his own if he chooses that course.

Obama is taking a gamble by putting the brakes on the military assault that he considers essential to maintain U.S. credibility after Assad crossed the "red line" set against the use of chemical weapons.

MORE EVIDENCE

The consensus on Capitol Hill is that Obama has a good chance of winning approval in the Democratic-led Senate, but the vote appears too close to call in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where the president's opponents rarely miss an opportunity to block him.

Acknowledging that the administration has its work cut out for it to persuade some lawmakers, Kerry insisted they could not "have it both ways" by demanding a voice in the matter and then abdicating responsibility to uphold the international bans on chemical weapons use.

Kerry used the television appearances to provide further evidence backing accusations against the Syrian government.

"I can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin," Kerry told CNN's "State of the Union."

It was the first time the administration had pinpointed what kind of chemical was used in the attack on a rebel-held area, which U.S. intelligence agencies said killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children.

"So this case is building and this case will build," Kerry told NBC's "Face the Nation."

OBAMA'S DILEMMA

Obama's efforts are sure to be hampered by his dismal relations with congressional Republicans. Another bitter face-off on government spending is looming this autumn.

Lawmakers for the most part welcomed Obama's decision to consult them, but looked in no hurry to reconvene early from their summer recess, which lasts until September 9.

Comments from leading Republicans and Democrats indicated how complex the debate will be - and raised doubts whether Obama would win their authorization.

Underscoring a sense of wariness even from Obama's traditional allies, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said the Vermont Democrat believes that the use-of-force resolution offered by the White House is too broad and that new language will be written for consideration.

Mike Rogers, Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN: "I think there are some real challenges. I think that at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion. This is a national security issue."

Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, speaking on NBC, took a more skeptical view.

While saying he was "proud" of Obama for coming to Congress for authority, Paul said, "It's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down the involvement in the Syrian war."

"I think the Senate will rubber stamp what he wants," he said. "The House will be a much closer vote." The Senate is controlled by Obama's Democratic Party, the House is in the hands of the Republican Party.

Republican Senator John McCain said he was not sure Obama's request would pass, but made clear his view that tougher military action was needed than the limited cruise missile strikes that the Obama administration is preparing.

Republican Representative Peter King of New York said it was unclear if lawmakers would sign off on an attack on Syria, but he warned Obama may have to overcome "the isolationist wing" of the Republican Party to prevail.

Seeking to lay the groundwork for what is expected to be a heated congressional debate, Kerry tipped his hand on one tactic the administration will use - linking the congressional vote to safeguarding U.S. ally Israel from the Syrian chemical weapons threat.

"I don't think they will want to vote, ultimately, to put Israel at risk," Kerry said.

Lawmakers of both major political parties recognize how important it is to be seen as defenders of Israel, especially at election time, when they compete to show voters who is a better friend of the Jewish state.

6:20pm EDT

Syria hailed a "historic American retreat" on Sunday, mockingly accusing President Barack Obama of hesitation and confusion after he delayed a military response to last month's chemical weapons attack near Damascus to consult Congress.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said tests had shown sarin nerve gas was fired on rebel-held areas on August 21, and expressed confidence that U.S. lawmakers would do "what is right" in response.

Washington says more than 1,400 people, many of them children, were killed in the attack.

It was the deadliest incident of the Syrian civil war and the world's worst use of chemical arms since Iraq's Saddam Hussein gassed thousands of Kurds in 1988. But opinion polls have shown strong opposition to a punitive strike among Americans weary of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Obama's announcement on Saturday that he would seek congressional authorization for punitive military action against Syria is likely to delay any strike for at least nine days.

But the United Nations said his announcement could be seen as part of an effort to forge a global consensus on responding to the use of chemical arms anywhere.

"The use of chemical weapons will not be accepted under any circumstances," U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said. "There should be no impunity and any perpetrators of such a horrific crime against humanity must be held accountable."

Arab states called on the international community to take action against the Syrian government.

The final resolution of a meeting of Arab League meeting foreign ministers meeting in Cairo urged the United Nations and international community to "take the deterrent and necessary measures against the culprits of this crime that the Syrian regime bears responsibility for".

The ministers also said those responsible for the attack should face trial, as other "war criminals" have.

Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal told Arab League counterparts on Sunday that opposing international intervention would only encourage Damascus to use weapons of mass destruction.

The Syrian government says the attack was staged by the rebels. With Obama drawing back from the brink, President Bashar al-Assad reacted defiantly to the threat of Western retaliation, saying Syria was capable of confronting any external strike.

He left his most withering comments to his official media and a junior minister.

"Obama announced yesterday, directly or through implication, the beginning of the historic American retreat," Syria's official al-Thawra newspaper said in a front-page editorial.

Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad accused Obama of indecision. "It is clear there was a sense of hesitation and disappointment in what was said by President Barack Obama yesterday. And it is also clear there was a sense of confusion as well," he told reporters in Damascus.

Before Obama put on the brakes, the path had been cleared for a U.S. assault. Warships were in place and awaiting orders to launch missiles, and U.N. inspectors had left Syria after gathering evidence on the use of chemical weapons.

Kerry invoked the crimes of Adolf Hitler, Saddam and the potential threat to Israel from Syria and Iran in urging skeptical U.S. lawmakers to back a strike on Assad's forces.

"This is squarely now in the hands of Congress," he told CNN, saying he had confidence "they will do what is right because they understand the stakes."

WEARY AMERICANS

It became apparent on Sunday that convincing Congress of atrocities committed by Assad's forces was only one of the challenges confronting Obama.

Lawmakers raised a broad array of concerns, including the potential effectiveness of limited strikes, the possible unintended consequence of sparking a wider Middle East conflict, the wisdom of acting without broader international backing to share the burden and the war weariness of the American public.

Many Democrats and Republicans are uneasy about intervening in a distant civil war in which 100,000 people have been killed over the past 2 1/2 years, and lawmakers have not cut short their summer recess, which ends September 9.

Mike Rogers, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, told CNN there were "real challenges," but added: I think that at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion. This is a national security issue."

Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky took a more skeptical view. "It's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down the involvement in the Syrian war," he told NBC.

"I think the Senate will rubber stamp what he wants," he said. "The House will be a much closer vote." The Senate is controlled by Obama's Democratic Party, while the House is in the hands of the Republican Party.

Members of Congress were briefed by Obama's national security team on the case for military action and Kerry said he had more evidence backing accusations against Damascus.

"I can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin," he told CNN.

U.N. weapons inspectors collected their own samples and diplomats say Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has told the five permanent Security Council members - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - that it would take up to two weeks before the final report is ready.

In Damascus, ordinary Syrians reacted with a mixture of relief, disappointment and scorn to Obama's decision. "I have to admit this morning was the first time I felt I could sleep in," said Nawal, who works as a housekeeper in the Syrian capital.

Bread had returned to the bakeries and members of the state security forces appeared relaxed, drinking tea and chatting at their posts outside government buildings.

"We always knew there wouldn't be a strike," one of them said. "It's not going to happen. Anyway, we were never nervous about it. We were just worried for the civilians. But we're confident it's not going to happen."

FRANCE CANNOT GO IT ALONE

The United States had originally been expected to lead a strike relatively quickly, backed up by its NATO allies Britain and France. But British lawmakers voted on Thursday against any involvement and France said on Sunday it would await the U.S. Congress' decision.

"France cannot go it alone," Interior Minister Manuel Valls told Europe 1 radio. "We need a coalition."

French President Francois Hollande, whose country ruled Syria for more than two decades until the 1940s, has come under increasing pressure to put the intervention to parliament.

A BVA poll on Saturday showed most French people did not approve of military action and most did not trust Hollande to conduct such an operation.

Jean-Marc Ayrault, his prime minister, was to meet the heads of both houses of parliament and the conservative opposition on Monday before lawmakers debate Syria on Wednesday.

French first lady Valerie Trierweiler said on Sunday she was still in shock over pictures of Syrian children killed in the attack and told France's M6, "I do not know how one can bear it, how one can accept it."

Syria and its main ally, Russia, say rebels carried out the gas attack to draw in foreign military intervention. Moscow has repeatedly used its U.N. Security Council veto to block action against Syria, saying it would be illegal and only inflame the civil war.

Critics say further delay by Obama is simply buying Assad more time.

The Istanbul-based Syrian opposition coalition said Assad had moved military equipment and personnel to civilian areas and put prisoners in military sites as human shields against any Western air strikes.

It said rockets, Scud missiles and launchers as well as soldiers had been moved to locations including schools, university dormitories and government buildings inside cities.

Reuters could not independently verify the reports, and attempts to reach Syrian officials for comment were unsuccessful.

Obama's credibility has already been called into question for not punishing Assad over earlier alleged gas attacks, and he is under pressure to act now that he believes Damascus has crossed what he once described as a "red line".

Failure to act, some say, could mean Iran would feel free to press on with a nuclear program the West believes is aimed at developing an atomic bomb and that might encourage Israel to take matters into its own hands.

"If Obama is hesitating on the matter of Syria, then clearly on the question of attacking Iran - a move that is expected to be far more complicated - Obama will hesitate much more, and thus the chances Israel will have to act alone have increased," Israeli Army Radio quoted an unnamed government official as saying.

Financial markets have been concerned about possible intervention in Syria and a delay caused by seeking congressional approval would be "a positive," said Michael Yoshikami, CEO of Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California.

"A delay will let investors calm down and assess things. There was a lot of concern that there would be unilateral military action, because that could have had a major impact on oil prices, which in turn would have impacted GDP and consumer spending - not what we want to see with economic growth still so slow, he said.

Pope Francis called for a negotiated solution to the conflict in Syria and announced he would lead a worldwide day of prayer for peace in the country on Saturday.



headline: Scornful Syria hails 'historic American retreat' as Obama hesitates
byline: By Yara Bayoumy and Rachelle Younglai
6:20pm EDT

Syria hailed a "historic American retreat" on Sunday, mockingly accusing President Barack Obama of hesitation and confusion after he delayed a military response to last month's chemical weapons attack near Damascus until after a congressional vote.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said tests had shown sarin nerve gas was fired on rebel-held areas on August 21, and expressed confidence that U.S. lawmakers would do "what is right" in response.

Washington says more than 1,400 people, many of them children, were killed in the attack.

It was the deadliest incident of the Syrian civil war and the world's worst use of chemical arms since Iraq's Saddam Hussein gassed thousands of Kurds in 1988. But opinion polls have shown strong opposition to a punitive strike among Americans weary of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Obama's announcement on Saturday that he would seek congressional authorization for punitive military action against Syria is likely to delay any strike for at least nine days.

His administration launched a political offensive on Sunday to win over a skeptical Congress, but faced tough questions from lawmakers in both parties.

The United Nations said Obama's announcement could be seen as part of an effort to forge a global consensus on responding to the use of chemical arms anywhere.

"The use of chemical weapons will not be accepted under any circumstances," U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said. "There should be no impunity and any perpetrators of such a horrific crime against humanity must be held accountable."

The final resolution of a meeting of Arab League meeting foreign ministers meeting in Cairo urged the United Nations and international community to "take the deterrent and necessary measures against the culprits of this crime that the Syrian regime bears responsibility for".

The ministers also said those responsible for the attack should face trial, as other "war criminals" have.

Before Obama put on the brakes, the path had been cleared for a U.S. assault. Warships were in place and awaiting orders to launch missiles, and U.N. inspectors had left Syria after gathering evidence on the use of chemical weapons.

U.S. military officials are using the delay to reassess which ships will be used for a strike, and which sites in Syria to target. One change was a decision to send the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and its entire strike group toward the Red Sea to help support a Syria strike, if needed.

SCEPTICAL CONGRESS

Kerry invoked the crimes of Adolf Hitler, Saddam and the potential threat to Israel from Syria and Iran in urging U.S. lawmakers to back a strike on Assad's forces.

"This is squarely now in the hands of Congress," he told CNN, saying he had confidence "they will do what is right because they understand the stakes."

It became apparent on Sunday that convincing Congress of atrocities committed by Assad's forces was only one of the challenges confronting Obama.

Many Democrats and Republicans are uneasy about intervening in a distant civil war in which 100,000 people have been killed over the past 2 1/2 years, and lawmakers have not cut short their summer recess, which ends September 9.

Members of Congress were briefed by Obama's national security team on the case for military action. When they emerged after nearly three hours, many members from both parties questioned the broad nature of the measure Obama is seeking, suggesting it needed to be narrowed.

"The president said this is going to be limited. Yet that's an open-ended authorization to just about do anything he wants," said Senator Tom Harkin from Obama's Democratic Party.

The White House is due to talk with House Democrats by telephone on Monday, and Obama will meet with the heads of several key House and Senate committees in person on Tuesday.

Kerry said he had more evidence backing accusations against Damascus.

"I can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin," he told CNN.

headline: German candidates clash on euro and taxes in tight TV duel
byline: By Noah Barkin and Stephen Brown
5:56pm EDT

Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Social Democrat challenger in this month's German election clashed over the euro, tax policy and U.S. spying in a television debate on Sunday that produced no clear winner.

The only TV duel of the campaign, watched by an estimated 15 million viewers, was one of SPD candidate Peer Steinbrueck's last chances to change the momentum in a race in which he has trailed the popular Merkel from the very start.

He accused the conservative chancellor, who is seeking a third term in the September 22 vote, of crushing southern European countries with austerity, failing to properly manage an exit from nuclear energy and overseeing a rise in low wage jobs.

"For four years we have been at a standstill. I want to change this," Steinbrueck said.

Merkel, 59, said SPD plans to raise taxes would put Germany's prosperity at risk, and noted that Steinbrueck's party had supported her euro policies throughout the crisis. Smiling, she turned to him and said: "You voted for everything."

Dressed in black, both candidates appeared relaxed, made no obvious gaffes and appeared to have good grasp of the issues.

Merkel, wearing a twisty necklace in the colors of the German flag, turned often to speak directly to her challenger, while Steinbrueck stared straight ahead at the panel of four questioners, which included cult talk show host Stefan Raab.

A poll by Infratest Dimap conducted after the debate gave Steinbrueck the edge, with 49 percent of respondents saying he won and 44 percent backing Merkel. Another poll by Forsa put Merkel slightly ahead, 44 versus 43 percent.

The 66-year-old former finance minister is known for his quick wit, but also for a know-it-all tone that can make him seem arrogant. His challenge in the debate was to criticize Merkel's policies without appearing overly aggressive, and in that he largely succeeded.

"Steinbrueck may have added a few points," said political scientist Juergen Falter. "The question is whether it is enough to mobilize voters for the SPD."

DEADLY DOSE

Some of the sharpest clashes came on the subject of Europe, a topic that had played only a small role in the campaign until a debate flared late last month over whether Greece might require a third bailout after the German vote.

Steinbrueck dismissed Merkel's European policy as a "failure" because of continued recession and sky-high unemployment in the southern euro countries that have had to swallow deep spending cuts in exchange for bailouts.

"I would have followed a different crisis strategy. Of course there must be budget consolidation in these countries, but not a deadly dose," Steinbrueck said.

"Germany once got help too and we must not forget that," he said. "Germany was massively helped after the Second World War with the Marshall Plan."

Merkel retorted that it was under SPD chancellor Gerhard Schroeder that Greece had been allowed to join the euro in the first place.

"As chancellor I have a responsibility to ensure the reform pressure on Greece does not let up," she said. "There could be a new Greek package but nobody knows how big it will be."

With three weeks to go until the vote, a survey from Emnid published on Sunday showed Merkel's conservative bloc -- the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) -- with a 16 point lead over Steinbrueck's SPD.

The size of the gap means it is highly likely that Merkel will remain chancellor after the election. What is less certain is whether she will win enough votes to continue her center-right coalition with the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP).

Should she fall short, she will be forced into difficult coalition talks with the SPD, with whom she ruled between 2005 and 2009. Steinbrueck was finance minister in this right-left "grand coalition", but he has ruled out serving under Merkel a second time.

FOUR GOOD YEARS

One of the reasons Steinbrueck has struggled to make a dent in Merkel's popularity is that the German economy has performed better than its European peers during the euro crisis, with unemployment now hovering near its lowest levels since reunification in 1990.

"We have had four good years for Germany and I want the next four years to be good as well," she said.

But Steinbrueck stressed that not everyone was prospering, with 7 million people earning less than the 8.50 euro per hour minimum wage that his party wants to introduce, funded by income tax increases for Germans earning above 100,000 euros annually.

"The tax hike plans of the Social Democrats and the Greens bring with them the risk that we spoil the good situation that we have instead of improving it," Merkel responded.

The candidates also touched on Syria, ruling out German participation in a military intervention that would be deeply unpopular here.

Steinbrueck suggested that Merkel had not reacted forcefully enough to revelations of U.S. and British surveillance which have touched a nerve in a country still haunted by domestic spying under the Nazis and East German Stasi secret police.

The last two German debates, in 2009 and 2005, had little impact on the election result.

But in the 2002 clash, Schroeder came from behind to win re-election after wrong-footing conservative Edmund Stoiber on his support for the looming U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.



headline: As Obama pushes to punish Syria, lawmakers fear deep U.S. involvement
byline: By Steve Holland and Susan Cornwell
6:20pm EDT

President Barack Obama's efforts to convince Congress to back his plan to attack Syria met with skepticism on Monday from lawmakers in his own Democratic Party who expressed concern the United States would be dragged into a new Middle East conflict.

Obama appeared to make some headway, however, with two influential Republican senators, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who came out of a White House meeting with him convinced that the president is willing to do more than simply fire off cruise missiles and also wants to bolster the Syrian opposition.

McCain, long an advocate of a more robust U.S. approach to Syria, said failure to get behind strikes against President Bashar al-Assad would be "catastrophic."

Obama's abrupt decision to halt plans for a strike against Assad's forces and instead wait for congressional approval has generated a raging debate just as the president prepares to go to Sweden and Russia this week.

Armed with evidence they say proves Syria's government killed over 1,400 people with nerve agent sarin, Obama's top national security aides made their case to Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives in a 70-minute conference call, urging them to back Obama's request.

The White House argument is that Syria must be punished for the August 21 chemical weapons onslaught and that at stake is the integrity of an international ban on such weapons and the need to safeguard U.S. national security interests and allies Israel, Jordan and Turkey.

Syria has blamed the attack on rebel forces.

As with much in which the divided Congress involves itself, there was deep disagreement on how to proceed, with some lawmakers worried the United States might be drawn into yet another Middle Eastern conflict in spite of Obama's pledges for a limited strike.

Overshadowing the debate are the ghosts of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, conflicts that lasted far longer and were far more expensive than first predicted. Congressional hesitancy reflects the overall weariness of war among Americans, who oppose getting involved in Syria.

Representative Chris Van Hollen, a senior Democrat and an ally of Obama on many issues, complained that the wording of the White House's request to Congress for the authorization of the use of force was too open-ended and could lead to deep U.S. involvement in Syria, where more than 100,000 people have died in more than two years of conflict.

"There is no limitation on putting American soldiers on the ground. There is no end point" on the resolution, he said. "The draft resolution presented by the administration is overly broad, it provides too much of a blank check to the executive," he said.

Van Hollen was among Democratic lawmakers briefed by conference call by Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, national security adviser Susan Rice, intelligence director James Clapper and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

OPPOSITION IN BOTH PARTIES

Obama needs to shore up his left wing, particularly in the House, where liberal Democrats and many conservative "Tea Party" Republicans are both opposed to more U.S. military action in the Middle East.

McCain and Graham are from the more traditional wing of the Republican Party that generally favors U.S. intervention abroad when deemed necessary. They want a broad strategy not just to punish Assad for the chemical weapons attack but to help Syria's rebels.

The Democratic-led Senate is expected to approve U.S. military action, but failing to win the support of McCain and Graham would be a blow to Obama's wider influence over Congress on Syria.

"I guess the way I would term the conversation is that there is a consensus being formed that we need to degrade Assad's capabilities and upgrade the Syrian opposition," Graham told reporters when he and McCain emerged from a one-hour White House meeting with Obama.

Representative James McGovern, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, said he was skeptical that Obama's plan for military strikes could help end the war in Syria. If the vote were taken today, he would vote no.

"People are horrified by the pictures of people suffering and they genuinely want to help. But people have become, it's more than just war-weary, they've become skeptical of the effectiveness of these military involvements," he said.

With Navy ships in place and ready to launch cruise missiles on Obama's order, no decision was likely until days after Congress returns from its summer recess on September 9. In the interim, Obama is using the time to build his case.

Washington's hesitancy has prompted mocking comments from Syrian leaders and a push from Assad's chief backer, Russia, to send members of the Russian parliament to the U.S. capital to argue against a strike.

Obama's gamble to seek congressional backing carries many risks, chief among them is that Congress will again thwart him and make him look weak around the world.

It may depend on building a majority House vote based on Obama's fellow Democrats joining those Republicans who support action, a senior House Republican aide told Reuters on Sunday.

"It's too early to speculate" what the House will do, the aide said, "but (House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi) is going to have to post a big number" among her members in support of it. The aide declined to predict how big.

Republicans hold the House, 233-200, with two vacancies.



headline: U.S. says its envoy took part in Israeli-Palestinian meeting
headline: Arab states urge action against Syrian government
headline: Egypt sends Mursi to trial as new constitution advances
byline: By Tom Perry
6:20pm EDT

backed authorities referred deposed President Mohamed Mursi to trial on Sunday on charges of inciting murder and violence, in an escalation of the crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood.

The new government also named a constituent assembly almost devoid of Islamists and gave it 60 days to review amendments that would erase Islamic articles brought in last year by the Brotherhood and more hardline Islamic parties.

Nearly two months after the army deposed Mursi, the moves underscored Egypt's dramatic power shift as its new rulers tighten their grip and crack down on the Islamists who rose to power through the ballot box after Hosni Mubarak's downfall.

A state prosecutor charged Mursi and 14 other Brotherhood members with "committing acts of violence, and inciting killing and thuggery", the state news agency reported.

The charges relate to violence in which around a dozen people were killed outside the presidential palace last December, after Mursi had ignited protesters' rage with a decree that expanded his powers.

The episode was one of the most violent of his presidency. Tens of thousands gathered outside the presidency to demonstrate against Mursi's decree and a divisive, Islamist-tinged constitution that he planned to put to a referendum.

The Brotherhood's leaders called on members to rally to his defense. The state news agency said they were now accused of mobilizing their followers to forcibly disperse the protesters after the security forces rejected Mursi's orders to do so.

The charges against Mursi include inciting his followers and assistants to commit crimes of premeditated murder and use violence and thuggery.

Mursi is also being investigated over his escape from jail during the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. He is suspected of murder and conspiring with the Palestinian group Hamas during his escape, though no formal charges have been brought.

Both the European Union and the United States, source of $1.3 billion in annual military aid to Cairo, had called for Mursi's release after he was detained following his overthrow on July 3.

MASS PROTESTS

He was toppled just a year into his term following mass protests fuelled by anger at economic mismanagement and Brotherhood attempts to entrench its power.

His downfall has led to some of the worst violence in Egypt's modern history, in the form of protests by his supporters, a bloody police crackdown on those supporters, and militant attacks on the police and churches.

At least 900 people, most of them Mursi supporters, were killed last month after the authorities smashed two protest camps set up by Mursi's supporters in Cairo.

Around 100 of the dead were members of the security forces, killed in what the state has described as a Brotherhood campaign of terrorism. The group denies resorting to violence, saying the government is using the charge to justify the crackdown.

Mursi's fall has also triggered a spike in violence in the Sinai Peninsula, where hardline militants expanded into a security vacuum left by the 2011 uprising against Mubarak.

Underlining the growing threat of attacks, an army source said three people had been arrested for opening fire with machine guns on a ship passing through the Suez Canal, the global shipping artery that runs through Egyptian territory.

During Saturday's unsuccessful attack, the Panamanian-registered container ship COSCO ASIA came under fire in a northern section of the canal, the source said. Canal Authority sources said a rocket-propelled grenade was also used.

The Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful resistance. It managed to bring thousands into the street last Friday in demonstrations against what it views as a "putschist regime" that aims to turn Egypt back into a police state.

The government says it will restore democracy with parliamentary and presidential elections once amendments to the constitution are approved in a referendum.

PANEL OF 50

The presidency named a 50-member panel that will review an extensive set of amendments drawn up by a "panel of experts".

The proposals would remove Islamic-influenced articles including one that gave Muslim scholars a say over some affairs of state, and also lift a ban on some Mubarak-era officials assuming public office.

Drawn up by a 10-member "committee of experts" appointed by decree, the draft preserves the privileged status of the military, which it effectively shields from civilian oversight.

Although Islamists won five popular votes held since 2011, the constituent assembly will have only two Islamists among its members. One belongs to the hardline Salafi Nour party, the other is a former Brotherhood leader now harshly critical of the group he left last year.

"It's a very establishment list," said Nathan Brown, an expert on Egypt based at George Washington University in the United States.

The presidency said six Islamist parties, including the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, had been approached to fill the two seats set aside for Islamists. Only Nour had responded. The Brotherhood says it wants nothing to do with the army's plans for Egypt.

The Brotherhood and the Nour Party secured a major say over the last constitution-drafting process by winning some 70 percent of the seats in parliamentary elections held after Mubarak's downfall.

Critics said the Islamists then sidelined other groups in a process that failed to reflect Egypt's diversity. The constitution was signed into law last December by Mursi after being approved in a referendum.

The Nour Party complained of a "disregard and exclusion of the Islamist current" in the make-up of the review panel.

Nour, which was founded after Mubarak's fall, noted that the committee left out members of the youth movements that ignited the uprising of January 25, 2011, "raising doubts about the panel's position towards the revolution".



headline: Iranian dissidents killed in Iraq camp, U.N. demands inquiry
byline: By Kareem Raheem and Sylvia Westall
6:20pm EDT

At least 47 people were reported killed at an Iranian dissident camp in Iraq on Sunday, the United Nations said, urging Baghdad to investigate the "tragic events" at a site north of the capital.

The violence took place hours after a mortar bomb attack on the camp which the dissent group Mujahadin-e-Khalq (MEK) blamed on the Iraqi army.

Two Iraqi security sources said that army and special forces had opened fire on residents who had stormed a post at the entrance to Camp Ashraf, a site that Iraq's government wants closed down. They said at least 19 were killed, 52 wounded and 38 arrested and that they believed residents were not armed.

However, the U.N. statement had a figure closer to the toll given by MEK, which said 52 of its roughly 100 members at the camp had been killed.

An advisor to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said reports that security forces had opened fire on the residents were baseless and said that Maliki had ordered an investigation into what had happened.

"We want to know the truth," advisor Ali al-Moussawi said. He said it was unclear what had caused the blast in the morning. Residents could have been killed in the explosion or through infighting at the camp, he said. He gave no casualty figures.

In a statement, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appealed for the urgent restoration of security in the camp.

"The United Nations deplores the tragic events at Camp Ashraf today that have reportedly left 47 killed," he said. Baghdad should "promptly investigate the incident and disclose the findings."

MEK, which the U.S. State Department removed from its list of terrorist organizations last year, said some residents were machine-gunned with their hands tied behind their backs.

The U.S. embassy in Iraq condemned "the terrible events that took place in Camp Ashraf" and the UN said it would send in a team from its Iraq office to carry out its own probe.

"We further call on Iraqi authorities to act with urgency to immediately ensure medical assistance to the wounded and to secure the camp against any further violence or harm to the residents," the U.S. embassy statement said, calling for a full, independent investigation.

MALIKI ORDERS PROBE

covered floors. It was not possible for Reuters independently to verify the images.

"The Iraqi government stresses the need for help to deport elements of the Mujahadin-e-Khalq who are on Iraqi soil illegally but at the same time confirms its commitment to the safety of souls on its territory," Maliki's office said in a statement referring to "events" at Camp Ashraf.

It gave no further details.

MEK wants Iran's clerical leaders overthrown and fought with former Iraqi Sunni Muslim leader Saddam Hussein's forces in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war.

It has been seeking to recast itself as an Iranian opposition force but is no longer welcome in Iraq under the Shi'ite Muslim-led government that came to power after U.S.-led forces toppled Saddam in 2003. Iraq's current government is close to Iranian authorities.

Mortar bomb attacks on a newer MEK camp in a former military compound in western Baghdad, where authorities had relocated most Camp Ashraf MEK members, took place in February and June. At the time, MEK blamed Iran's Quds force - an elite unit of the Revolutionary Guards with a special focus on foreign operations.

MEK, also known as the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran, led a guerrilla campaign against the U.S.-backed Iranian Shah during the 1970s that included attacks on U.S. targets.

headline: Thousands rally in Romania against gold mine
headline: TV confessions in China an unsettling new trend for executives
byline: By Megha Rajagopalan
6:20pm EDT

controlled television has spurred anxiety among the business community about a trend that some lawyers say makes a mockery of due process.

Confessions have long been part of China's legal landscape, with petty criminals routinely admitting their guilt on television.

But rarely have senior business figures been put on television in orange prison jumpsuits to confess.

"If involuntary to any degree, the admissibility of the confessions is in question," said James Zimmerman, a managing partner at law firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter and Hampton and a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce China.

"Parading just-detained criminal defendants in the media is repugnant and reflects political expediency and a rush to judgment," he said in an e-mail.

Chinese-American venture capitalist Charles Xue appeared on state CCTV on Thursday to confess to visiting prostitutes, a crime in China.

Xue, also known as Xue Manzi, is an online commentator known for making controversial remarks on social and political issues. The U.S. embassy in Beijing said Washington was aware of his case and was providing consular assistance. It was unclear if Xue had a lawyer.

Last week, Peter Humphrey, a British risk consultant accused of buying and selling private information, apologized to the government on CCTV in a neon orange vest and handcuffs, saying he had sometimes used illegal methods in his work.

Humphrey, who once worked for Reuters, has a lawyer, his family have said without disclosing who it is. The British Foreign Office has expressed concern about Humphrey's appearance on television before any trial.

Humphrey and his American wife were detained in July, around the same time Chinese police announced they were investigating British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline for alleged bribery.

The couple's risk consultancy, ChinaWhys, had done work for GSK, sources familiar with the matter have said.

A Chinese GSK executive arrested in the anti-corruption investigation appeared on CCTV in July to describe how the firm bribed doctors and officials to raise the price of its medicines. GSK has said some of its Chinese executives appeared to have broken the law.

China's Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

An amendment to China's criminal procedure law, which took effect at the start of the year, prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.

But confessions are coerced out of high- and low-profile offenders alike, criminal law experts said.

Ousted politician Bo Xilai, accused of bribery and abuse of power, said during his trial in August that he had been forced to admit to crimes against his will.

"Even Bo Xilai backtracked on his confession on the grounds that he felt that he was pressured to make a confession in order to get leniency or to maintain his political position," Zimmerman said.

JUSTICE, MAO-STYLE

Indeed, suspects often strike deals to confess and apologize in the hope they will receive more lenient punishment.

Three milk powder makers who were investigated as part of a recent antitrust probe into the industry were not fined because, among other things, they carried out "self-rectification", the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which regulates prices, said.

If that doesn't happen, authorities can get heavy-handed.

Reuters reported last month that a senior NDRC official put pressure on some 30 foreign firms at a meeting in late July to confess to any antitrust violations and warned them against using external lawyers to fight accusations from regulators.

Publicizing confessions before a formal criminal process could reflect "a wider trend of returning to Mao-style criminal justice", said Eva Pils, law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

During the Mao years, Pils said, "the point of the criminal process wasn't to determine whether or not the person at its center was guilty - at the time that was practically a foregone conclusion. Rather it was to educate the public - in this case, presumably also a foreign public."

When it comes to public confessions in politicized cases, the desire to spread propaganda may trump the rule of law.

"This isn't an issue of the law," said Chen Ruihua, a law professor at Peking University. "It's an issue of the media. They want to publicize these cases."

President Xi Jinping has called China's fight against corruption crucial to the ruling Communist Party's survival. Televised confessions help make clear to the public that authorities are tough on graft, legal activists said.

"The Chinese public is very suspicious about any legal process involving corruption, so showing someone on TV confessing is really very powerful," said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch. "But it makes the whole trial look like a farce if people go on TV to confess beforehand."

The more important issue, Bequelin said, is the message getting sent to foreign investors.

"The signs are unmistakable that the government is cracking the whip against foreign companies."



headline: South Africa's Mandela back home after long hospital stay
byline: By Peroshni Govender
6:20pm EDT

apartheid leader and former South African President Nelson Mandela returned to his home on Sunday where he will continue to receive intensive care after three months in hospital with a lung ailment.

Mandela, 95, had spent 87 days in a Pretoria hospital after he was rushed there in early June suffering from a recurring infection of the lungs, a legacy of the nearly three decades he spent in jail under apartheid.

"Madiba's condition remains critical and is at times unstable. Nevertheless, his team of doctors are convinced that he will receive the same level of intensive care at his Houghton home that he received in Pretoria," South Africa's presidency said in a statement. It referred to Mandela by the traditional clan name by which he is affectionately known.

The Nobel Peace Prize laureate's latest hospitalization in June had attracted a wave of attention and sympathy at home and across the world.

His home in Johannesburg's Houghton suburb had been "reconfigured" to allow him to receive special care there, the presidency added. Police blocked off a section of the street in the upscale neighborhood, where a crowd of reporters and camera crews had gathered.

"The health care personnel providing care at his home are the very same who provided care to him in hospital. If there are health conditions that warrant another admission to hospital in future, this will be done," the presidency added.

"It is a day of celebration for us, that he is finally back home with us," Mandela's grandson and heir Mandla said in a statement, acknowledging that he was "not a young man anymore".

Mandla said his grandfather's discharge from hospital disproved claims that Mandela was in a "vegetative" state "waiting for his (life) support machines to be switched off, in effect declaring him dead".

Thousands of well-wishers had visited the Pretoria medical facility during his stay there to leave flowers, cards and gifts.

Mandela made his last public appearance waving to fans from the back of a golf cart before the Soccer World Cup final in Johannesburg in 2010. In April state broadcaster aired a clip of the thin and frail statesman being visited by President Jacob Zuma and top officials from the African National Congress.

The ruling party said he was "in good shape" but the footage showed a weak old man sitting expressionless in an armchair.

"He is out of hospital, that alone is good news for us. We don't want to be thinking negative. We just want to remain optimistic. He is alive and kicking and a part of us, that's good enough," Motemi Tinashe said outside the Mandela Family House Museum in Soweto, south of Johannesburg, where he lived before his imprisonment.

MORALS

For more than a decade Mandela has been out of politics, dividing his time in retirement between his home in Houghton and Qunu, the village in the impoverished Eastern Cape province where he was born.

His admission to hospital four times in six months has reminded the nation of the mortality of the father of the post-apartheid "Rainbow Nation" and the morals he stood for.

"I often wonder how much Mr Mandela knows about what is going on in South Africa and the state of politics. The ANC is a disappointment and I pray he doesn't know that," said Thomas Mkhize, a Johannesburg taxi driver.

"The current leaders care more about themselves and their pockets than the people," he said. Many analysts and critics accuse the century-old ANC of having lost its moral compass.

The anti-apartheid leader was elected South Africa's first black president in multi-racial elections in 1994 that ended white minority rule.

Mandela's imprisonment included 18 years on the notorious Robben Island penal colony, when he and other prisoners were forced to work in a limestone quarry and he first suffered the lung infections that were to dog him for years.

The presidency requested that Mandela and his family be given "the necessary private space so that his continuing care can proceed with dignity and without unnecessary intrusion."



headline: Japan government abandons hands-off approach to Fukushima clean-up
byline: By Linda Sieg and Mari Saito
6:20pm EDT

up of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, as concerns grow over the ability of embattled operator Tokyo Electric to handle the legacy of the worst atomic disaster in a quarter century.

The concerns have also revived debate about the future of Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) itself, including early-stage proposals to put its toxic nuclear assets under government control and leave the rest of the company as a provider of power to the nation's biggest economic region.

"I want the government to have a responsible framework - not just for checking what Tokyo Electric is doing to deal with Fukushima - but for the government to commit to dealing with the Fukushima problem itself and conduct this as a joint operation, including the water problem and decommissioning," said Tadamori Oshima, who heads the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's taskforce on post-disaster reconstruction.

"Concerning the question of what the government will pay for and what Tepco will pay for, I think we need to debate and redraw the line," Oshima told Reuters in an interview.

Public worries about Fukushima, revived by news of leaks of radiated water at the plant, have threatened to further delay the restart of other off-line reactors - a key element of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recipe for economic revival and a pillar of the turnaround plan Tepco has given its creditor banks.

Japan's nuclear industry, which once provided a third of the nation's power, has nearly ground to a halt since a massive quake and tsunami struck the coastal Fukushima plant in March 2011, causing reactor meltdowns. Tepco has been pumping water over the reactors to keep them cool, storing the radioactive waste water as well as contaminated ground water in ever-growing numbers of above-ground tanks.

"What is clear by now and can hardly be ignored is that Tepco as a private company is overwhelmed by the containment work in Fukushima," said Martin Schulz, a senior research fellow at Fujitsu Research Institute.

"The discussion about nationalizing or breaking up Tepco and at least putting the stabilization of the Fukushima reactors under direct government control is back."

Japanese officials also fear the glare of international attention could threaten Tokyo's bid to host the 2020 Olympics, a decision on which will be made by the International Olympics Committee on September 7 in Buenos Aires.

Japan's foreign ministry has begun issuing English language updates on the plant and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government now carries the latest radiation data on its website showing that radiation levels in the capital, some 230 km (140 miles) from Fukushima, are on par with or lower than London and New York.

GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE

Tepco said on the weekend that radiation near a tank holding highly contaminated water at the plant had spiked 18-fold, to a level that could kill an exposed person in four hours. It said no new leak had been detected at the tank, but another leak was found from a pipe connecting two other tanks.

Tepco, Japan's largest utility, last year got a 1 trillion yen ($10.2 billion) injection of tax money in exchange for giving the government a de facto controlling stake but management has been left to the company. The firm also gets public funds - in theory to be paid back - to help compensate residents forced to flee after the 2011 quake and tsunami triggered triple meltdowns at the plant.

The government has insisted that the utility should be responsible for the cost of decommissioning the reactors, a job expected to take decades and require as yet non-existent technologies, although the government has budgeted research and development funds - including an industry ministry request for a 40 percent boost to 12.5 billion yen in the budget for 2013/14.

The government has said it will unveil steps to address the huge accumulation of radioactive water at the plant soon.

Abe's cabinet is also likely to discuss this week funding for the Fukushima clean-up after a series of revelations about leaks of radioactive water at the coastal plant, Oshima said.

Steps under consideration would fall short of the liquidation called for by Tepco's harshest critics - including Hiroki Izumida, the governor of Niigata Prefecture, which hosts Tepco's mammoth Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear plant.

Such calls were rejected in the months after the March 2011 disaster, when authorities judged Tepco was too big to fail.

"First, the government should make a further commitment and make every effort under the current framework," Oshima said.

LDP Deputy Secretary General Koichi Haguida, a close aide to Abe, agreed liquidation was not in the cards but said the government must take the lead not just in dealing with the floods of water contaminated by the process of keeping the damaged reactors cool, but in decommissioning as well.

"Fukushima is a problem that must be separately resolved. So rather than leaving this solely to Tepco's responsibility, the government will take the initiative and get involved in dealing with the contaminated water and decommissioning to a significant extent," he told Reuters in an interview.

It is unclear whether more direct government involvement would open the door wider to foreign contractors.

U.S. firms such as Kurion and Shaw Group, a unit of Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company, and EnergySolutions Inc have been engaged in water treatment at Fukushima, though a Reuters investigation in December found foreigners had won few, if any, contracts to develop technologies for scrapping the reactors.

DECOMMISSIONING AGENCY?

One option that has been floated is to create a new legal framework to give the Japanese government direct oversight at Fukushima, perhaps along the lines of Britain's National Decommissioning Authority, a public body charged with managing the dismantling of Britain's atomic power and research stations.

"I have said from way back that Japan should set up a decommissioning agency," Yasuhisa Shiozaki, the LDP's acting policy chief, said on a TV show last week.

Tepco said the utility welcomed the government's involvement in dealing with contaminated water but said it was hard to comment on any possible spin-off of the Fukushima operations.

"Either way, the company will continue to work with the government to thoroughly carry out decommissioning," company spokesman Yoshimi Hitotsugi said.

Taking on the Fukushima clean-up as a government project could be politically risky for Abe, who returned to power for a rare second term in December, since that would mean it could no longer lay the blame for missteps at Tepco's door.

Tepco's admission on July 22 - one day after Abe's LDP-led bloc won an upper house election - that contaminated water was leaking into the Pacific despite earlier denials, spurred the government to pledge to support efforts to stem the flow.

The intervention by the government at Fukushima comes at a time when Tepco's long-term sustainability remains in doubt.

The utility has aggressively cut costs and hiked electricity rates last year. But its failure to win local support for restarting its Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear plant has cost it an estimated $1 billion per month in added fuel costs.

"For Tepco to be reborn, it is imperative for the Kashiwazaki nuclear plant to start moving," said Osamu Goto, a director general for energy and environment policy at the industry ministry's Natural Resources and Energy Agency. "If this situation continues, they will have to raise rates again or we enter bankruptcy territory."



headline: Sri Lanka criticizes U.N. rights chief's 'authoritarian' comment
byline: By Shihar Aneez
6:20pm EDT

Sri Lanka's government said on Sunday U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay had acted beyond her mandate in saying the country was heading in an authoritarian direction.

Pillay, ending a seven-day mission to assess Sri Lanka's progress after the 26-year war between the government and separatist Tamils, said on Saturday the country was "showing signs of heading in an increasingly authoritarian direction.

"The High Commissioner's observation...is a political statement on her part, which clearly transgresses her mandate and the basic norms which should be observed by a discerning international civil servant," the government's Information Department said in a statement posted on www.news.lk.

"The judgment on the leadership of the country is better left for the people of Sri Lanka to decide than being caricatured by external entities influenced by vested interests."

The government also criticized a planned floral tribute at the location where the Tamil Tiger separatist leader Velupillai Prabhakaran was killed, selective media access to her visit to former war zones as well as her comments on a newly created law and order ministry, and on religious minorities.

Pillay's statement on Saturday came a day after Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa told her his people believed the U.N. was biased, and a report she was due to release this month had already prejudged the country.

A U.N. panel has said it has "credible allegations" that both sides committed atrocities and war crimes, and singled out the government for most of the blame.

Pillay's visit followed a second U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution in March this year that urged Sri Lanka to carry out credible investigations into killings and disappearances during the civil war, especially in the final stages.

Pillay visited the former northern war zones in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and the eastern district of Trincomalee, and met leaders in the capital of Colombo. The visit has sparked demonstrations for and against her mission.



headline: In sweatshops, the 'Brazilian dream' goes awry
byline: By Lucas Iberico-Lozada
6:20pm EDT

When Margot Alarconciles woke up one morning last year and found her son sick with what appeared to be a cold, there was little she could do but wrap him in an extra blanket, walk down the hallway and start her workday: sewing clothes for up to 11 hours a day, six days a week.

"I couldn't leave my machine," she said. "Without my job, we could not eat."

Her 5-year-old son's condition deteriorated, and without proper care he soon died. Still grieving, Alarconciles now questions her decision to leave her native Bolivia for Brazil, where salaries can be many times higher but poor immigrants often must settle for work in sweatshops.

"This work is not worth it," she said on a recent Sunday as she waited to meet with an accountant who helps immigrants avoid legal problems by filing tax returns.

known retailers, officials and immigrant advocacy groups tell Reuters.

Their stories show how one of the world's biggest economic shifts of the past decade - the rise of large emerging markets such as Brazil - have generated new social problems that many of the countries don't yet have the financial resources or experience to deal with properly.

As the economy boomed, the "Brazilian dream" became a magnet for workers from poorer Latin American countries such as Bolivia, Peru and even faraway Haiti. While Brazil's per capita income is only a quarter of the United States', it's still double that of Bolivia - and its currency has been so strong in recent years that migrant workers have been able to support entire families back home.

In Sao Paulo, the country's business center, the number of immigrants from other South American countries more than doubled between 2000 and 2010 to over 23,000, according to the Brazilian statistics agency IBGE. However, unofficial estimates by city officials put the number at between 200,000 and 400,000.

Alarmed by soaring reports of labor abuses as the migrants flowed in, Brazilian officials in 2009 tried to bring immigrants out of the shadows by signing a regional agreement that made it easier for many of them to receive work visas.

Rather than rely solely on police raids to uncover abuses, the government also consults regularly with immigrants' advocacy groups to find trouble spots and has held retailers responsible for labor abuses on production lines.

However, like many other recent initiatives including greater policing of Brazil's borders, the officials monitoring immigrants' welfare appear to be understaffed and underfunded.

Sao Paulo's metropolitan area has a population of 20 million. Luis Alexandre Faria is one of just two labor ministry inspectors charged with coordinating investigations into "slave labor," the government's term for sweatshop conditions.

Following a recent raid of three sweatshops, he said he believed he was just scratching the surface of the problem.

"I would not be particularly surprised if there were 20 or 30 of these places, all supplying clothes to the same company under the same conditions," Faria said.

The influx of poor migrants into such jobs has continued despite a sharp slowdown in Brazil's economy during the past two years, according to Roque Pattussi, the director of CAMI, a Brazilian immigrant advocacy organization.

"To an immigrant from Bolivia's highlands, Brazil is still the kind of place where somebody can make good money," he said.

FACTORY RAIDS - AND REPARATIONS

Faria and his colleague, Renato Bignami, spend most of their day poring over financial statements, hunting for clues that companies rely on low-pay labor.

In a recent case involving Le Lis Blanc, a high-end Brazilian retailer, Bignami said the company's statements showed that some of its divisions were producing thousands of product units a year without a single employee.

In June, Faria led a raid of three workshops he said were listed in Le Lis' financial statement, shutting all of them down. On the government's orders, Le Lis paid the workshops' 28 workers an average of 22,000 reais ($9,400) apiece to make up for unpaid and underpaid work.

In August, the government announced that it had added a fine of 1 million reais.

Le Lis Blanc's Brazilian parent company, Restoque Comercio e Confeccoes de Roupas SA, denied any knowledge of illegal work conditions at the workshops in a statement to Reuters, saying that two independent contractors had hired the workshops. It signed an agreement with the labor ministry to comply with the investigation and pay the workers, though it denies any wrongdoing.

In such cases, rather than deport the workers, the Brazilian government gives legal work visas to those who lack them, Pattussi said, illustrating the more tolerant approach in place since 2009.

Immigrants and advocates say the structure of sweatshops in Sao Paulo has evolved a lot over the past decade.

The factories used to be run mostly by Korean immigrants, but many were busted by the police because of their large size. The industry is now dominated by smaller, Bolivian-run operations, many of them in private homes, they say.

Angela Reveta Lauta moved to Brazil from Bolivia when she was five years old. Now, at 28, she owns a "confeccionaria" - a company that hires workshops on short contracts to produce clothing in bulk for large wholesalers and retailers.

"When I arrived here ... nobody thought anything of Bolivian immigrants," she said. "Now, however, buyers come directly to me. They recognize that our work is the best. I am proof that life for Bolivians is better."

LONG DAYS, LONG NIGHTS

Yet many immigrants still live in a dark underworld where they see the government as an enemy determined to keep them from earning a good living.

Jesus, a 32-year-old Bolivian who didn't want to give his last name for fear of being targeted by the police, started his own workshop when his Korean boss went out of business after suffering two police raids in one month.

"She told us to rent a house and buy the machines we had been working on from her. We like it here," he said, placing a calloused hand on a metal shutter in front of the house. "It's quiet, and we can work in peace."

Still, setting up his own business has multiplied his risks. When he worked for the Korean woman, rent and food were deducted from his paycheck, meaning the rest was his to spend. He often sent it back to Bolivia, to his ailing father.

Now, he has to pay his part of the rent in a house he shares with a brother plus nearly $500 a month - on top of a whopping $10,000 two-year lease - for a stall measuring 4 square meters in a converted warehouse in a morning bazaar.

Jesus arrives at the bazaar in the commercial neighborhood of Bras at 5:30 a.m. to sell the cotton blouses that he, his wife and a niece produce in a small room in their house. After a quick lunch, he returns home to join the two women, working well into the evening.

"Thankfully, the Brazilian culture is one of luxury. Brazilians change their look two or three times a month," Jesus said with a smile. "That's good for the seller."

For the rank-and-file workers, life can be even more of a day-to-day battle.

Miguel, a Bolivian immigrant who also did not want his last name used, was one of the workers left without a job after the labor ministry's raid of factories producing for Le Lis Blanc.

Asked what he would do with the back wages he received, Miguel said he would stay in Brazil for at least another year. That would be enough time to bring his family over from Bolivia, rent a house and try to find another job, this time as a taxi driver.

Barring that, he would probably find work at another garment factory.

"Something is something," he said. "Having nothing would be worse."

headline: Egypt names key constitution panel with few Islamists
byline: By Tom Perry and Shaimaa Fayed
5:56pm EDT

backed government unveiled a constituent assembly on Sunday almost devoid of Islamists, and gave it 60 days to review amendments that would erase Islamic articles brought in by the Muslim Brotherhood and more hardline Islamic parties.

The constitutional review is part of a road map unveiled by the administration that took power after the army deposed President Mohamed Mursi on July 3.

Egypt will hold parliamentary and presidential elections only once the constitution is approved in a referendum.

Reflecting a power shift as the government cracks down on the Brotherhood, accusing it of terrorism, the changes proposed in a first draft of the constitution may open the way for a comeback by some members of the old order associated with Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled in a popular revolt in 2011.

The proposed amendments would remove Islamic articles - hotly disputed by secularists - that include one that gave Muslim scholars a say over some affairs of state, and also lift a ban on some Mubarak-era officials assuming public office.

Drawn up by a 10-member "committee of experts" appointed by decree, the draft preserves the privileged status of the military, which it effectively shields from civilian oversight.

Although Islamists won five popular votes held since 2011, the constituent assembly will have only two Islamists among its 50 members. One belongs to the hardline Salafi Nour party, the other is a former Brotherhood leader now harshly critical of the group he left last year.

PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT ABSENT

While the assembly includes the founders of the Tamarud petition campaign that galvanized support for protests that led to Mursi's downfall, there is no obvious place for the pro-democracy youth movements that ignited the 2011 revolt against Mubarak.

There are also places for Muslim scholars, representatives of the church, the arts, unions, members of secular parties and prominent figures such former Arab League chief Amr Moussa and renowned heart surgeon Magdi Yacoub.

"It's a very establishment list," said Nathan Brown, an expert on Egypt based at George Washington University in the United States, adding: "The procedure does seem to tilt in favor of accepting what the experts have drafted."

The presidency said six Islamist parties, including the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, had been approached to fill the two seats set aside for Islamists. Only Nour had responded.

The Brotherhood says it wants nothing to do with the army's plans for Egypt, decrying Mursi's removal as a coup against a democratically elected head of state.

At least 900 people, most of them Mursi supporters, have been killed since he was toppled.

The Brotherhood and the Nour Party secured a major say over the last constitution-drafting process by winning some 70 percent of the seats in parliamentary elections held after Mubarak's downfall.

Critics said the Islamists then sidelined other groups in a process that failed to reflect Egypt's diversity. The constitution was signed into law last December by Mursi after being approved in a referendum.

The panel will meet for the first time on September 8.

Still, setting up his own business has multiplied his risks. When he worked for the Korean woman, rent and food were deducted from his paycheck, meaning the rest was his to spend. He often sent it back to Bolivia, to his ailing father.

Now, he has to pay his part of the rent in a house he shares with a brother plus nearly $500 a month - on top of a whopping $10,000 two-year lease - for a stall measuring 4 square meters in a converted warehouse in a morning bazaar.

Jesus arrives at the bazaar in the commercial neighborhood of Bras at 5:30 a.m. to sell the cotton blouses that he, his wife and a niece produce in a small room in their house. After a quick lunch, he returns home to join the two women, working well into the evening.

"Thankfully, the Brazilian culture is one of luxury. Brazilians change their look two or three times a month," Jesus said with a smile. "That's good for the seller."

For the rank-and-file workers, life can be even more of a day-to-day battle.

Miguel, a Bolivian immigrant who also did not want his last name used, was one of the workers left without a job after the labor ministry's raid of factories producing for Le Lis Blanc.

Asked what he would do with the back wages he received, Miguel said he would stay in Brazil for at least another year. That would be enough time to bring his family over from Bolivia, rent a house and try to find another job, this time as a taxi driver.

Barring that, he would probably find work at another garment factory.

"Something is something," he said. "Having nothing would be worse."

man's land between Serbia and Macedonia, dozens of grainy figures shuffled through the sights of his thermal goggles.

"I have a feeling we're going to get lucky tonight," the Serbian border patrol officer said with a grin.

Among the 34 illegal immigrants netted that night trying to steal into Serbia was Mohammad Bakr.

The 25-year-old Syrian, a clean-cut student of electrical engineering, said he had fled the besieged city of Aleppo after his home was struck by a rocket fired in an unrelenting civil war.

With him were 11 relatives, including small children, part of a rising tide seeking passage from Syria and the tented squalor of refugee camps on its borders to the safety of Western Europe.

It had taken Bakr six months to get this far, running a gauntlet of extortion and abuse at the hands of professional people-smugglers and corrupt police.

As Washington weighs a military strike against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, the human fallout of two and a half years of conflict that has sent millions to flight is no longer contained to the Middle East.

It's on Europe's doorstep.

"We have no other solution," said Bakr, sitting on the cold ground in a clearing where Ivanovic and two other officers struggled in broken English to interrogate their catch. "We have nowhere else to go," he said.

Last year brought a fourfold increase in the number of Syrians trying to enter the Western Balkans from Greece, one leg of a route from Turkey to the prosperous West in search of asylum.

While Greece is in the EU, it is geographically cut off from the rest of the borderless Schengen zone and immigrants are increasingly unwelcome as Greeks wrestle with an unprecedented economic crisis. Illegal migrants head north to Macedonia or Bulgaria, some through Serbia, trying to reach Hungary and on through open borders to Western Europe.

In Bulgaria, on Turkey's western border and the poorest member of the European Union, the number of Syrians seeking asylum has shot up from 85 in 2011 to 449 in 2012 and 855 in the first seven months of this year alone. Twice as many are estimated to have made the illegal crossing.

Romania has reported an 80 percent rise in the first half of this year from the same period of 2012, to a total of some 640.

"PRISON-LIKE CONDITIONS"

"We're conducting constant operations," Svetlozar Lazarov, secretary general of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry, said during a trip to the border city of Svilengrad.

"Forces and military equipment are deployed along the border and we have increased air surveillance," he told reporters.

On the night of Aug 27 alone, of 52 people detained crossing the frontier from Turkey into Bulgaria, 39 were from Syria. On Friday, police said another 106 were apprehended, of which 79 were Syrians.

Refugee centers in Bulgaria are full to the brim, putting a strain on meager budgets and a creaking bureaucracy.

Due to lack of capacity at Bulgaria's three refugee centers, many Syrians are sent to stricter detention centers which they are not allowed to leave, kept for months behind walls topped with razor-wire and windows with bars.

The government this week urgently allocated another $380,000 to boost capacity by another 500 places.

"In the detention centers, refugees are in prison-like conditions," said Boris Cheshirkov, spokesman for the Bulgarian office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.

"But at least they get food three times a day. In the open reception centers (refugee centers), they have to live off 65 Levs per month, which is less than a dollar a day for food, clothes and medicine."

At one such centre in the city of Lubimets, some 30 km inside the Bulgarian border with Turkey, young men staring from behind barred windows shouted "Freedom!" and "Help us, please" to visiting journalists.

One, mimicking the shooting of a gun, shouted "Assad - pa, pa, pa!" Then crying out "Bulgaria", he placed his hands around his neck, as if strangling himself.

Of 270 people at the centre, 143 were from Syria. Some rooms are shared by up to eight families at a time.

"This is no place for kids," said resident psychologist Iskra Kasheva. "It can even slow their mental development," she said. "It's no secret that the refugee camps are 120 percent full - there's no place to put them."

EXTORTION, ABUSE

More than 100,000 people have died in war that has turned increasingly sectarian. Millions have been driven from their homes inside Syria and about two million have sought refuge abroad in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq.

Traffickers demand anywhere between a few hundred euros and 3,000 euros to get their human cargo across borders.

"We paid 500 euros per adult and 250 per child to get here," said 24-year-old Janda Hussein, who said she had fled the Syrian capital Damascus with her husband and their two-year-old daughter.

"We went by foot," she said. "In Turkey we couldn't find work and were spending all our money."

In Serbia, where Syrians made up the single largest group of asylum seekers in the first half of this year, several of those apprehended with Bakr spoke of beatings by police in Macedonia, Greece's northern neighbor, and robberies by mafia gangs.

One of their number, believed to be from Afghanistan, was shot dead the previous night by armed men, they said.

Abu Umar from the eastern Syrian city of Deir al-Zor said Greek police had taken money from him and others, jailed them for two months and then issued them with expulsion papers. They fled to Macedonia, where he said they were beaten by security forces.

Once in Serbia, some of those caught and who immediately request asylum are issued preliminary paperwork, dropped off at the nearest bus or train station and given 72 hours to reach one of the country's asylum centers.

Many simply then try their luck at Serbia's borders with EU members Hungary and Croatia. Beyond the normal border police at regular crossings, Serbia has around 30 patrol officers like Ivanovic to monitor 113 kilometers of frontier with Macedonia, a notorious smuggling route for guns, drugs and people.

Bakr, who was studying when a peaceful uprising against Assad turned into war in March 2011, said he had been caught several times on crossing from Greece into Macedonia, but was released each time after a day or two and told to by police to return the way he came.

He said he and his family would not give up until they reached Hungary and the borderless Schengen zone, then on to Germany where relatives and friends await them.

"I tried for 15 days trying to cross the Macedonian border," he said. "It will be the same with Serbia, every day until we make it."



headline: Afghanistan's Karzai rings the changes in security leadership
byline: By Hamid Shalizi
3:59pm EDT

Afghan President Hamid Karzai named his second new interior minister in a year on Sunday, appointing presidential hopeful Umer Daudzai in the security job and underlining a sense of political fragility ahead of next year's presidential vote.

In the second major security appointment in as many days, the reshuffle could unsettle Western governments keen for stability as they prepare to withdraw most international combat troops by the end of 2014.

"In order to improve the managing of our security affairs, the appointment of Umer Daudzai as caretaker Minister of Interior has been approved by a presidential decree," said a statement from the Afghan Cabinet Secretariat.

Daudzai's appointment will be viewed through the prism of April's presidential election, given he is interested in running but is not allowed to hold a ministerial position if he does so.

The announcement comes a day after Karzai appointed senior security official Rahmatullah Nabil as the acting head of the Afghan intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security (NDS).

The previous NDS head, Assadullah Khalid, was forced to step down for health reasons after being wounded in a failed assassination attack in December.

Both Daudzai and Nabil will have two months in the job and will require parliamentary approval to stay on longer, according to the Afghan constitution.

Daudzai, who until Sunday's appointment was the Afghan ambassador to Pakistan, replaces former policeman Ghulam Mujtaba Patang. The statement made no reference to Patang, and he could not be reached for comment.

In late July parliament voted to dismiss Patang, saying he had been unable to tackle a worsening security environment. Karzai challenged the decision and said Patang would stay as acting minister while he sought legal advice from Afghanistan's Supreme Court.

Patang, a majority Pashtun and former police officer, had risen swiftly in Karzai's government, leading efforts to train police and volunteer militias, and forging close ties with Western donors as a liaison with NATO reconstruction teams.

Last August parliament voted to remove then Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak and then Interior Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi over a series of assassinations of top officials and incidents of cross-border fire with neighboring Pakistan.



headline: Syrian opposition urges U.S. congress to back military action
headline: Netanyahu mum on Obama's Syria delay but says Israel strong alone
byline: By Dan Williams
6:20pm EDT

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu played up Israel's ability to take on its enemies alone on Sunday after Washington delayed attacking Syria in a surprise move that prompted some Israelis to question their main ally's resolve on Iran.

U.S. President Barack Obama said on Saturday he would ask Congress to vote on whether to launch strikes to punish the Damascus government for a poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians.

The hold-up jarred Israelis who see in the Syria showdown a test of the Americans' ability to make good on a pledge to deny Iran the means to make a nuclear bomb through military force if diplomatic alternatives fail.

"Israel is serene and self-confident," Netanyahu said in public remarks to his cabinet before its weekly meeting.

"Israel's citizens know well that we are prepared for any possible scenario. And Israel's citizens should also know that our enemies have very good reasons not to test our power and not to test our might," he said.

He did not mention Iran nor Syria by name, but in previous statements he has linked the two cases.

Army Radio, a major Israeli broadcaster, quoted an unnamed government official in far less elliptical terms.

"If Obama is hesitating on the matter of Syria, then clearly on the question of attacking Iran - a move that is expected to be far more complicated - Obama will hesitate much more, and thus the chances Israel will have to act alone have increased."

Netanyahu has sparred with Obama over Iran in the past. Obama wants more time to pursue Western sanctions and negotiations to curb a nuclear program Iran says is peaceful.

Obama has not ruled out war. On Saturday he appeared to allude to this in remarks urging support for attacking Syria.

"If we won't enforce accountability in the face of this heinous act, what does it say about our resolve to stand up to others who flout fundamental international rules? To governments who would choose to build nuclear arms?" he said.

Polls show, however, that attacking Syria would be strongly opposed by Americans weary of the Iraqi and Afghan campaigns.

Commentators in Israel are deeply divided on whether Syria has much to do with the Iranian situation.

Naftali Bennett, an ultranationalist partner in Israel's coalition, said on Facebook, "More than 1,000 civilians, many of them babies and children, were murdered by a dark regime using poison gas. And the world hesitates. This is a major lesson. At the moment of truth, we will depend only on ourselves."

Moshe Arens, a former Israeli defense minister, spoke in favor of Obama's Syria deliberations, arguing that the U.S. president was reluctant to take sides in the conflict between Assad and rebels who include al Qaeda-linked radical Islamists.

He also dismissed any link between crises in Syria and Iran.

"There is no analogy here. In Iran the enemy is clear, the objective is clear and what has to be done is clear," he said. "It would illusory to think that if Obama does not make good the commitment he made to lob a few Tomahawks at Syria that is a sign that in Iran, too, he will not do what is required."

headline: Obama delays strike against Syria to seek Congress approval

President Barack Obama stepped back from the brink on Saturday and delayed an imminent military strike against Syria to seek approval from the U.S. Congress in a gamble that will test his ability to project American strength abroad and deploy his own power at home.

Before Obama put on the brakes, the path had been cleared for a U.S. assault. Navy ships were in place and awaiting orders to launch missiles, and U.N. inspectors had left Syria after gathering evidence of a chemical weapons attack that U.S. officials say killed 1,429 people.

But Obama decided to seek the backing of U.S. lawmakers before attacking, as polls showed strong opposition from Americans already weary of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Approval will take at least 10 days, if it comes at all.

"Today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move as one nation," Obama said in a dramatic shift announced in the White House Rose Garden.

Obama, whose credibility has been called into question for not punishing the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for earlier poison gas attacks, warned lawmakers they must consider the cost of doing nothing in Syria.

"Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?" he said.

Obama's approach has left in doubt whether the United States will carry through with the military steps that the president has already approved. Backing from lawmakers is by no means assured, with many Democrats and Republicans uneasy about intervening in a distant civil war in which 100,000 people have died over the past 2-1/2 years.

Lawmakers for the most part welcomed Obama's move but there were no steps to bring lawmakers back to Washington early from their summer recess, which lasts until September 9.

"In consultation with the president, we expect the House to consider a measure the week of September 9," said John Boehner, the top U.S. Republican and speaker of the House of Representatives. "This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people."

House members are to receive a classified briefing on Sunday from administration officials to hear the case against Syria. Officials briefed senators on Saturday.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, who was unable to persuade the British parliament to back action earlier in the week, welcomed Obama's move, as did the government of French President Francois Hollande, with whom Obama spoke on Saturday.

In rebel-held areas of Syria, there was a sense of frustration and disappointment.

"God curse everything," said an activist in the rebel-held territory of Idlib, Ahmad Kaddour. "We've become just a game to people. I think this is going to make the situation worse for those of us living here."

A Reuters reporter visited a group of fighters and activists sitting in a home in Aleppo city. They had not watched Obama's speech, and when told of the president's decision, they all agreed it meant there would be no U.S. strike.

"This is the same old hesitancy that the United States have tortured us with since the beginning of the revolution," one said.

Aides said Obama had been working toward taking military action, but it was only late on Friday when he decided that he first wanted to seek the approval of Congress - an option his advisors had not previously discussed.

Senior administration officials who briefed reporters after Obama spoke said they believed Congress will vote in favor of a U.S. military strike because of the threat chemical weapons pose to the security of U.S. ally Israel and other friends in the region.

The August 21 attack - the deadliest single incident of the Syrian civil war and the world's worst use of chemical arms since Iraq's Saddam Hussein gassed thousands of Kurds in 1988 - has galvanized a reluctant Washington to use force after years on the sidelines.

The team of U.N. experts arrived in the Netherlands on Saturday carrying evidence and samples relating to the attack. They had flown from Beirut after crossing the border into Lebanon by road earlier in the day. No Western intervention had been expected as long as they were still on the ground in Syria.

The 20-member team had arrived in Damascus three days before the August 21 attack to investigate earlier accusations of chemical weapons use. After days holed up in a hotel, they visited the sites several times, taking blood and tissue samples from victims in rebel-held suburbs of Damascus and from soldiers at a government hospital.

WAR WEARINESS

War weariness cost Washington the support of its closest ally: Britain has backed action but was forced to pull out of the coalition after Cameron unexpectedly lost a vote over it in parliament on Thursday, straining London's "special relationship" with Washington.

Syria and its main ally, Russia, say rebels carried out the gas attack as a provocation. Moscow has repeatedly used its U.N. Security Council veto to block action against Syria and says any attack would be illegal and only inflame the civil war there.

"I am convinced that (the chemical attack) is nothing more than a provocation by those who want to drag other countries into the Syrian conflict," President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday.

Syria's Foreign Ministry repeated its denial that the government had used chemical weapons against its own people. Washington says the Syrian denials are not credible and that the rebels would not have been able to launch such an attack.

Syria's neighbor Turkey backs the use of force. The Arab League, whose members mainly oppose Assad, has said Syria is to blame for the chemical attack but so far stopped short of explicitly endorsing Western military strikes. Arab League foreign ministers are due to meet in Cairo on Sunday.

Iran, Assad's main ally in the region, has condemned plans for strikes and warned of wider war.

Syria's civil war has driven millions from their homes since 2011, when Assad's forces cracked down on street protests and his enemies took up arms.

The war splits the Middle East on its main fault line between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims and has already spread to neighboring Iraq and Lebanon, threatening to reignite their own civil wars.



headline: Two governments continents apart face defeat despite booms

fuelled booms while other economies sank into crisis.

Voters in Australia and Norway are almost certain to boot out their governments within a couple of days of each other, fed up with blunders and scandals, and worried that wealth created by high minerals and oil prices has not been spent wisely.

Opinion polls indicate sound defeats for Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in parliamentary elections on Sept 7 and his Norwegian Labour counterpart Jens Stoltenberg on Sept 9.

In both countries a weariness with parties that have served relatively long terms is mixed with concern that the economic miracles are fading, leaving the countries badly prepared for life after the resources boom.

Oslo lawyer Peter Isaksen gives Stoltenberg no credit for Norway's good times. "The government doesn't set the oil price, so that's not their merit, and we have become dangerously dependent on oil," said Isaksen, who describes himself as a swing voter. "And I'm really tired of them."

"It's a comfortable life now but I'm not so sure about the future," Isaksen added.

Australia's dusty outback and the frigid seas off Norway are worlds apart, but wealth from there has helped both economies to prosper over the past decade. An unprecedented commodities boom made them among the richest countries in the world, insulated from years of international economic crisis after the 2008 financial crash.

Australia has enjoyed 22 years without a recession, thanks to appetite for its iron ore and coal, while Norway's per capita GDP hit $100,000 this year on booming oil and gas exports. The United Nations have ranked the two as the best places to live.

While some similarities are striking, so are the differences. Rudd's Labor party has been beset by a long-running leadership struggle, while the wider election campaign has sunk at times into smear. Rupert Murdoch's Sydney tabloid newspaper, for instance, has depicted Rudd as a bumbling Nazi running a "mob".

By contrast Nordic civility has characterized the Norwegian campaign. The government's handling of Norway's darkest post-war day two years ago - when Anders Behring Breivik slaughtered 77 people, most of them young members of Stoltenberg's Labour party - has been a taboo issue.

But the outcomes are likely to be similar. The latest Norwegian opinion poll showed a four-party conservative opposition bloc on course to win 95 seats in parliament, 10 more than it needs for a majority. In Australia, polls give the opposition conservatives 53 percent support to Labor's 47 percent, enough to sweep Rudd's minority government aside.

WASTED BOOM?

Australia's bull run, propelled by China's until recently insatiable demand for natural resources, lifted household net wealth by over a quarter in the past decade to $728,000 while keeping unemployment at a relatively low 5.7 percent - a level undreamed of throughout most of Europe, outside Norway.

But with the good times have come rising living costs and a soaring Australian dollar, hurting other sectors of the economy such as manufacturing and retail. Mining wages are now the second highest in the world, trailing only those in Norway's energy industry, creating huge pressure for other industries competing for workers.

Car manufacturing has been hit particularly hard while consumers have started saving much more and borrowing a lot less, a poisonous mixture for the retail sector.

Aside from the economy, Rudd's government has struggled to handle asylum seekers trying to head for the country and to stop human trafficking.

"Voters want governments that do two things: manage the economy and national security. People think they have done neither," Nick Economou, a political scientist at Monash University in Melbourne said.

The federal or "Commonwealth" government has raised the mining tax, citing Norway's 78 percent levy on oil income as an example, while easing the burden on the low-paid. Overall it has failed to rein in a budget shortfall in a country where surpluses are normal and deficit is a dirty word.

"The Commonwealth Government has not saved enough of the proceeds of the boom. Tax decreases and spending increases have been larger than Australia can afford in the long run," the Grattan Institute, a think tank funded mostly by the government said. "Underlying budget deficits now need to be repaired in more difficult times."

Growth in both countries remains high compared with most other developed economies but shows signs that more difficult times do lie ahead.

Australia's economy grew 3.1 percent in 2012 but in the first quarter this year the annual rate slipped to 2.5 percent, and is forecast to have stayed at that level in the second as demand and prices for its commodities cool.

Norway has followed an eerily similar path, as record investments in the offshore oil sector pushed wages and the currency sharply higher, leaving traditional industries unable to compete on their already struggling overseas markets.

Growth is also expected to slow this year to 2.5 percent, according to the central bank, from 3.4 percent in 2012. Even this may prove overoptimistic; second quarter GDP was much weaker than forecast as the industries outside the energy sector suffer and households cut spending sharply.

The oil sector, which accounts for a fifth of the economy, is working to capacity and keeping unemployment below 3 percent, but bankruptcies in traditional industries were up 46 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier while productivity growth stagnated.

The Norwegian state is saving oil wealth, amassing $750 billion or $150,000 per man, woman and child. But the opposition accuses the government of wasteful spending, saying it should plough more into infrastructure, health and care of the elderly.

"The state has become a lot bigger but not any better, a lot of people will argue, and there's a lot of credibility in that argument," Johannes Bergh, a political analyst at the Institute for Social Research in Oslo said. "People will argue they didn't do enough to prepare for Norway after the oil."

More than anything, many Australians and Norwegians just want a change. For Rudd, the biggest problem is voters' anger about a de-stabilizing leadership fight that has lasted for much of Labor's six years in power. In 2010 Rudd was ousted by Julia Gillard, only for Rudd to stage a counter-coup this year after much bitter and very public infighting.

"What they did to Rudd, they should never have done. That's played so badly with people, and they've never forgiven them for what happened," says Sydney voter Trish McCudden, 66, a lifelong Labor supporter now considering a switch to the Greens.

Ruling without a parliamentary majority for three years only added to the trouble as the government was often forced into messy compromises and policy flip-flops, infuriating voters.

DARK SHADOW

For Stoltenberg, the fight is with history and a dark shadow that has hung over Norway since Breivik attacked the government building and a Labour Party youth camp.

"Talking about the attack is a taboo in the campaign, not least because the attack was on Labour itself," Terje Knutsen, a political science professor at the University of Bergen said.

However, a government commission determined that the Stoltenberg administration, the police and security services had made several blunders and Breivik's attack may have been preventable. "That report created a strong feeling they are not fit to govern," Knutsen said.

Stoltenberg, who won elections in 2005 and 2009, also seems at odds with a Norwegian political culture that does not favor long-serving leaders.

On top of a brief first term more than a decade ago, he has been in office for the past eight years, the longest stint for any leader in half a century. He is now bidding for a third straight term, something no Norwegian prime minister has achieved.



headline: Pope asks other faiths to join day of prayer for peace in Syria
byline: By Philip Pullella
6:20pm EDT

Pope Francis on Sunday invited people of all faiths to join him and the world's Catholics in a day of prayer and fasting on September 7 to end the conflict in Syria.

Addressing tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square, he issued a long, impassioned appeal for peace in Syria and across the Middle East, saying God and history would be the judge of those who promoted violence or prevented peace.

Francis condemned the use of chemical weapons, blamed by Western powers on Syrian government forces, but added: "War, never again".

The United States and France are considering military action against Damascus in response to the chemical attack but Francis urged the international community to make every effort to bring about peace based on "dialogue and negotiations".

"Violence never leads to peace, war leads to war, violence leads to violence," he said.

The pope asked the 1.2 billion Roman Catholics around the world to pray for peace in Syria and observe a day of prayer and fasting on Saturday.

Francis announced his initiative a day after a meeting of top Vatican officials on Syria. He said he would lead a special prayer service in St. Peter's Square on Saturday between 7 p.m. and midnight (1800-2300 GMT).

The pope invited other Christians, members of other religions and all "people of goodwill" to join the Catholic initiative in any way they saw fit.

The peace initiative is reminiscent of several made by the late Pope John Paul, including one in which he dispatched envoys to Iraq, the United States and European capitals in 2003 to try to avert war in Iraq.

ditch plea to voters.

Rudd, promising a "New Way" in his main campaign launch in the battleground state of Queensland, sought to capitalize on unease among voters about promised conservative opposition spending cuts, warning they would hurt jobs and confidence.

"In this election we are now engaged in the fight of our lives," he told thousands of cheering supporters.

"Never, ever, ever underestimate my fighting spirit as your prime minister. I have been in tougher spots before and come back from behind," said Rudd, the leader of Australia's first minority government in decades.

A Galaxy poll in newspapers belonging to media magnate Rupert Murdoch gave opposition leader Tony Abbott a 53 to 47 percent lead over Labor, enough to deliver a convincing parliamentary majority to the conservatives on Saturday after six years in the wilderness.

Major weekend newspapers across the country also called for a switch in government. Sydney's mass-selling Sun-Herald criticized Rudd's centre-left Labor as "negative, incoherent, incohesive and, the worst of all, uninspiring".

The apparent malaise among a majority of Australia's 14 million voters, for whom voting is compulsory, comes despite the country being in its 22nd year of unbroken growth and with joblessness at a relatively low 5.7 percent.

Australia under Labor steered safely through the 2008 global financial crisis, buoyed by a China-led resource export boom that transformed it into one of the world's best economies.

Much of the anger against Labor comes from a leadership fight that has simmered through its six years in power.

Rudd was toppled in 2010 by Julia Gillard, who became Australia's first female premier, but then pushed Gillard out again this year after long and bitter public infighting. Gillard did not attend Rudd's campaign launch on Sunday.

Abbott accuses Labor of being "dysfunctional" and of wasting the resource boom by running up record debt and budget deficits. He is promising $31 billion in spending cuts to bring a faster return to surplus.

Rudd appealed to voters with traditional Labor values such as universal healthcare, a pension system holding $1.5 trillion in savings, worker protections and support for a manufacturing sector struggling with a high Australian dollar.

The conservatives would unravel carbon taxes aimed at protecting the environment, he said, while scaling back an ambitious taxpayer-funded broadband network under construction.

Murdoch's tabloids, chastised by the media watchdog for bias in their election coverage, called for Australians to switch government. One front page had a picture of Abbott with a headline saying "Australia Needs Tony".

"Labor's fragile grip on parliamentary majority has created a shambolic, often comically inept administration that routinely undermines its own achievements and credibility," the Australian-born media mogul's Sunday Telegraph paper said.

Rudd's deputy Anthony Albanese described the front page as an "absolute disgrace", accusing the paper of having breached its code of ethics requiring balanced coverage.

headline: Obama will hold off on Syria strike until Congress has its say
byline: By Roberta Rampton and Jeff Mason
6:20pm EDT

President Barack Obama on Saturday backed away from an imminent military strike against Syria to seek the approval of the U.S. Congress, in a decision that likely delays U.S. action for at least 10 days.

Obama, in a stern statement from the White House Rose Garden, said he had authorized the use of military force to punish Syria for a chemical weapons attack August 21 that U.S. officials say killed 1,429 people. Military assets to carry out a strike are in place and ready to move on his order, he said.

But in an acknowledgement of protests from U.S. lawmakers and concerns from war-weary Americans, Obama added an important caveat: he wants Congress to approve.

"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual," he said.

Congress is in recess and not scheduled to return to work until September 9. It is unclear which way any vote would go.

"Today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move as one nation," Obama said.

Obama's decision was a high-stakes gamble that he can gain approval from Congress for a limited strike against Syria to safeguard an international ban on chemical weapons usage, defend U.S. national security interests and protect regional allies like Turkey, Jordan and Israel.

"I have long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in our example as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people," Obama said.

His decision was also a significant shift away from what was perceived to be preparations for a speedy strike against Syrian targets. He had made clear he was prepared to act unilaterally after the British parliament refused to go along with American plans.

Protracted and expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have left Americans reluctant to get involved in Middle Eastern conflicts.

Most Americans do not want the United States to intervene in Syria. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken this week showed only 20 percent believe the United States should take action, but that was up from 9 percent last week.

DEBATE IN WASHINGTON

A debate has raged for days among members of the U.S. Congress over whether, or how quickly, Obama should take action.

House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top U.S. Republican, welcomed the move, which he said is a response to "serious, substantive questions" being raised about the ability of the president to launch a military move on his own.

"In consultation with the president, we expect the House to consider a measure the week of September 9. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people," he said.

Obama, who only on Friday had said nobody was more war-weary than he is, has nonetheless been appalled by searing video images of Syrians who fell under the chemical weapons onslaught.

In his Saturday speech, he left no doubt that he feels action must be taken and is confident that a strike would deter this kind of behavior and degrade Syria's ability to carry out similar attacks.

But his decision may well lead to criticism that he conceivably is stepping away again from a "red line" he established against Syrian use of chemical weapons.

"President Obama is abdicating his responsibility as commander in chief and undermining the authority of future presidents. The president does not need Congress to authorize a strike on Syria," said Republican Representative Peter King.

Obama's decision was announced after he met his national security team at the White House. Top aides were to brief senators later in the day and members of the House of Representatives are to receive a classified briefing from administration officials on Sunday.

The objective is to show the intelligence U.S. officials say is solid proof that the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad launched a large chemical weapons assault in Damascus suburbs that left among the dead 426 children.

Obama has broad legal powers to take military action, and he insisted he felt he had the authority to launch a strike on his own. Now, he has to launch a major effort to convince Congress.

"Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?" he said.



headline: Indian teen sentenced to three years in Delhi gang rape case

An Indian teenager was sentenced to three years in juvenile detention on Saturday for the December gang rape of a trainee physiotherapist, the first verdict in a case that sparked debate over whether India is too soft on young offenders.

Police say the 18-year-old and five adult men lured the 23-year-old woman and her male friend onto a New Delhi bus where they repeatedly raped her and beat them both with a metal bar before dumping them on to a road.

The woman died in a Singapore hospital two weeks after the December 16 attack. The case turned a global spotlight on the treatment of women in India, where police say a rape is reported every 20 minutes.

"The juvenile has been found guilty under rape and murder charges, and accordingly sentenced to three years of jail," Rajesh Tiwari, a lawyer for the juvenile, told reporters.

The lawyer said the juvenile would be sent to a reform home to serve the term, taking into account the months he has already spent in detention since his arrest.

Four of the teenager's co-accused are still on trial and face the death penalty if convicted. Closing arguments began on August 22 and verdicts are expected within the next fortnight. A fifth accused, the alleged ring-leader, killed himself in his jail cell in March.

The teenager, who may not be named, was tried as a juvenile as he was 17 at the time of the attack. The maximum penalty that could be imposed by the Juvenile Justice Board was three years.

In January, authorities ruled he was 17, citing school records, which shocked the victim's family and others clamoring for him to face the death penalty.

"You may as well set the juvenile free, if the sentence is only three years for heinous offences like rape and murder," said the victim's mother who was in tears after the verdict.

The mother also said she would appeal against the verdict in a higher court.

"I am not happy with this judgment. At least in this case, the juvenile should have been sentenced to life," the victim's brother told Reuters.

In response to the public outcry after the rape, the government fast-tracked tougher laws against sex crimes, but it resisted calls to change the juvenile law and return the adult age to 16 from 18.

SUPREME COURT PETITION

India's Supreme Court is currently hearing a petition filed by Subramanian Swamy, an opposition politician and lawyer, that calls for the law to be reinterpreted rather than changed.

Swamy wants a minor offender's "emotional, intellectual and mental maturity" to be assessed when deciding whether to try them as a juvenile, rather than basing the decision on age alone.

"I felt that, with the kind of rape that took place, if (the juvenile suspect) got off lightly it would send a bad signal to society," Swamy told Reuters. He plans to launch an appeal against the verdict reached on Saturday if the Supreme Court rules in favor of his petition later this year.

The teenager pleaded not guilty to all 13 charges including rape, murder and robbery. His trial was held behind closed doors to protect his identity and media were barred from reporting on any details of the proceedings.

During his trial, he has been held at a juvenile detention facility for violent young offenders in Delhi and kept away from other inmates for his safety.

vagrant, washing buses and collecting fares, according to a police report.

After leaving home, he never returned and his mother said she thought he was dead until police arrested him in connection with the gang rape.

Some 33,000 crimes were committed by juveniles in India last year, the highest number in a decade, but there has not been a large spike, according to Home Ministry figures. Juveniles commit a tiny proportion of total crimes in India and far less than other nations such as the United States.

byline: By Pete Jones
5:56pm EDT

Fighting erupted on Saturday between eastern Congolese rebels and the army, which said it would push on with an offensive to recapture all territory controlled by insurgents despite their call for a ceasefire.

Democratic Republic of Congo's army, backed by a new U.N. brigade with an unprecedented mandate to launch attacks, has forced M23 rebels to retreat from positions they have held for months overlooking the eastern city of Goma.

Some shells fired during recent fighting have landed in neighboring Rwanda, threatening to pull the small but militarily powerful country openly into the conflict.

Both Congo's army and rebels have accused the other of firing the missiles. U.N. experts and Congo's government says Rwanda is already backing the rebels but Kigali denies this.

Both sides said fighting erupted several kilometers (miles) north of Kibati, hilltop positions seized from rebels on Friday - the latest in nearly two decades of unrest fuelled by ethnicity, local politics and competition over land and mineral wealth.

" are criminals and we are obliged to pursue them. We want to recapture all of the territory they currently occupy and restore the authority of the army and state," said Congolese army spokesman Lt Colonel Olivier Hamuli.

In a statement sent to journalists, M23 confirmed the resumption of fighting and complained it came despite a pullback by its troops and an offer of a ceasefire.

RWANDAN ARMOUR

U.N. forces in North Kivu province, where the fighting is taking place, said they were not involved in the latest clashes.

The army's U.N.-backed advance this week is the most significant victory government troops have recorded during this latest 18-month rebellion, whose leaders complain the Kinshasa government failed to honor the terms of a deal to end an earlier, similar uprising.

M23 seized Goma last November after insurgents overran the army and marched past U.N. peacekeepers. The rebels withdrew under intense international pressure and started peace talks with the government but these have stalled.

The failure of U.N. peacekeepers to protect Goma led to the creation of an "Intervention Brigade" with a robust mandate to neutralize rebels. This force was spurred into action last week by the shelling of Goma and nearby Gisenyi, in Rwanda, that killed several civilians.

The United Nations has blamed the rebels for the shelling but M23 and Rwanda have said Congo's army was responsible. Kigali has accused Kinshasa of provocation and has not ruled out dispatching troops to Congo to protect its territory.

Rwandan media published photos of armor being sent towards Rwanda's northern border with Congo this week. Congo's government and U.N. peacekeepers have said there are already signs of Rwandan infiltration.

Diplomats say world leaders are applying pressure on Rwanda's President Paul Kagame not to intervene.

Rwanda and Congo have fought two wars in the last two decades, with Kigali arguing it had to send troops to Congo to hunt down extremist Hutu rebels who fled to Congo after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.

ravaged nation would continue.

"I have seen all kinds of reporting suggesting that the departure of the chemical weapons team somehow opens a window for military action of some kind," U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters.

"Frankly, that's grotesque, and it's also an affront to the more than 1,000 staff, U.N. staff, who are on the ground in Syria delivering humanitarian aid and who will continue to deliver critical aid," he said.

U.N. experts arrived in the Netherlands on Saturday with evidence gathered in their investigation of a poison gas attack in Syria. Also on Saturday, President Barack Obama said he had decided the United States should strike Syrian government targets, but that he would seek a congressional vote for any military action.

Nesirky repeated that the inspectors would return later to investigate several other alleged poison gas attacks that have taken place in Syria during the country's 2-1/2-year civil war.

He also responded to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's remarks on Friday that the U.N. chemical weapons experts cannot provide any information that the United States, which blames Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for last week's attack that Washington says killed more than 1,400 people, does not already have.

"The United Nations mission is uniquely capable of establishing in an impartial and credible manner the facts of any use of chemical weapons based directly on evidence collected on the ground," he said.

Assad's government, like Russia, blames the rebels for last week's alleged chemical weapon attack.

that it would take up to two weeks before the chemical inspectors' final report is ready.

NO CHANGE IN INSPECTORS' MANDATE

U.N. officials say the world body's findings will be important because they will be widely seen as irrefutable, in contrast to doubts that arise with intelligence in light of the erroneous information on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs that was used to justify the 2003 invasion.

Nesirky was also asked about the legality of any military action against Syria without authorization of the Security Council. He responded by saying: "The secretary-general has underscored the importance of the U.N. charter."

According to the U.N. charter, the council should authorize any military action that does not involve self-defense.

Obama said on Saturday he was "comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council that so far has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Assad accountable."

"While the U.N. investigation has some time to report on its findings, we will insist that an atrocity committed with chemical weapons is not simply investigated," he said. "It must be confronted."

Russia, backed by China, has used its veto power in the Security Council three times to block resolutions condemning Assad's government and threatening it with sanctions.

The United States has bypassed the United Nations in the past when the council was deadlocked, such as in the case of the Kosovo war in 1999. At that time, Washington relied on NATO authorization for its bombing campaign.

The U.N. inspectors will determine only whether chemical weapons were used last week and in several other alleged poison gas attacks, not who used them. Nesirky was asked why the United Nations does not expand the mandate to include naming those responsible for any chemical attacks.

"The mandate is the mandate. The team and the secretary-general will abide by that mandate," he said. "The mandate is robust and provides for the United Nations to be able to provide for, in an impartial and credible manner, a picture of what happened."

He added that the mandate was derived from a U.N. General Assembly resolution.

"Let's not forget that these are scientists, technical and medical experts who braved sniper fire to go to collect samples and to interview witnesses and survivors," he said.

The United Nations has received at least 14 reports of possible chemical weapons use in Syria. After months of diplomatic wrangling, the U.N. experts, led by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom, arrived in Syria on August 18 with a 14-day mandate to visit the country.

The U.N. team was initially going to look into three incidents, but its priority became last week's attack. The inspectors have also been looking into Syrian allegations that the rebels used chemical weapons three times this month against the Syrian army - allegations that Washington has dismissed.

nation body meet, the envoys told Reuters on Saturday.

The upcoming Group of 20 nations summit in St. Petersburg, Russia on September 5-6 would be a good opportunity for Ban, who will be attending, to discuss the Syrian crisis with world leaders, Nesirky said.

has more cause to worry.

Syrians living in the United States are deeply divided about what should be done - with some calling for a swift bombing campaign to unseat President Bashar al-Assad, while others blame the crisis on rebel groups. Yet both camps are united in fearing that U.S. strikes will only mean more bloodshed back home.

The 2-1/2 year conflict has touched the lives of many ex-patriate Syrians, as stories unfold of family members and friends who have been killed or beaten - either by forces loyal to the Syrian regime or by the opposition.

In the town of Paterson, New Jersey, about 20 miles south of New York City, is a section called "Little Syria," where a sizable Syrian community lives and works. Restaurants and shops along Main Street keep their television sets tuned to news channels showing the latest developments in the civil war, while friends are quick to pass along Internet videos showing destruction from the latest attacks.

"I wanted the USA to step in from the beginning to defeat Assad," said Ahmed Jay, 22, whose family opened Paterson's Aleppo Restaurant after moving to the United States in 2004. "I have ten friends who have died; two cousins, one aunt, one uncle. We've gotten used to crying."

Others said they felt let down - by both the Obama administration and the international community. Britain's parliament earlier this week voted against military action in Syria.

"This is the third year Assad has been killing people," said Mohamad Rahmoun, 55. "Why do we have to suffer like this? I call the White House every day, every day. I tell them we need help."

"We want Obama to bomb the regime," he said. "But we don't want civilians killed."

On Friday, Obama said he was considering a "limited, narrow" military action to punish Assad for a poison gas attack outside Damascus that U.S. intelligence said killed 1,429 people.

On Saturday, White House officials were to make their case to the full Senate.

They could face a tough audience, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll showing that 53 percent of Americans, weary after a decade of foreign wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, believe the United States should stay out of Syria.

"A lot of people think something should be done, but nobody wants to do it," Obama said.

'I AM WORRIED'

The question is a particularly tough one for Syrians with family members back home. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 159,000 people of Syrian ancestry live in the United States, with the largest concentration in the northeast, according to data from 2009.

Mossab Awad, a 27-year-old medical student in Massachusetts, said he thought Washington had little choice but to strike, but worried about the safety of his mother, father and brother.

"How do we know the missiles won't kill innocent people, and how do we know it won't just cause Assad to be even more brutal?" Awad said. "He can set the region in flames."

Adding to Awad's anxiety is the fact that he has not heard from his family in his government-controlled hometown of Idlib for days.

"When I last talked to them, they were fine. But the phones have stopped working and I have heard the rebels are trying to take Idlib," he said. "I am worried."

Syrians in America who support the Assad regime, or simply distrust the rebel groups, warn that U.S. military intervention could only lead to further destabilization in the region.

'UNNECESSARY WAR'

Some blame the opposition for many of the atrocities, including the August 21 poison gas attack, and fear the country could follow down the path of Iraq, which has been plagued by sectarian violence since the end of the U.S.-led invasion.

Syrians and anti-war activists calling for "Hands Off Syria," have been staging daily protests in Manhattan.

The rebels "are driving America and the rest of the world into another unnecessary war in a fabricated, orchestrated scenario of having chemical weapons. Just like what happened in Iraq," said Tom Sarkin, 37, who was 17 when he immigrated to the United States from Aleppo.

Others said the Assad government was defending the Syrian people from an influx of foreign fighters and their Islamist influence.

"These (rebel) fighters aren't from Syria, they are called Islamic Brotherhood and they are from all over ... Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya ... from all over the world," said Farah Slebi, 22, who moved to Brooklyn, New York, five years ago to attend school.

She called Assad "a good man."

"He brought technology to Syria. He made online studying, just like in the U.S.," Slebi said. "We didn't ask for this freedom from Assad. We were free."

During a protest in Times Square on Thursday, Slebi got in a heated argument with someone from a counter-demonstration calling for regime change in Syria.

"We used to be friends," she said. But no longer: "He's against the government."

led strike on Syria has not only put government forces on alert, it has also alarmed rebels, in particular Islamist groups linked to al Qaeda who worry they too are targets.

The United States said on Friday it was planning a limited response to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a "brutal and flagrant" chemical weapons attack it says killed more than 1,400 people in Damascus two weeks ago.

But Islamist rebels are wary, particularly experienced foreign militants who have joined their ranks and may have seen at first-hand U.S. military campaigns and drone strikes on al Qaeda fighters across the region.

Islamist forces have cleared many of their bases of fighters, vehicles and weaponry, according to rebels and sources close to Qaeda-linked fighters.

"Of course we've been moving our fighters and equipment. Do you think we trust the Americans?" said a fighter from the moderate Islamist rebel group called Liwa al-Islam, speaking by Skype from a suburb outside the capital Damascus.

"They gave Assad two weeks' notice to clear his bases. We know we're the real target."

Al Qaeda-linked groups such as the Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) appear to be taking even more extensive and secretive measures.

"ISIL has evacuated many of its centers, mainly in northern and eastern Syria. They've increased security for the emirs (leaders), changing their locations and their cars - they fear homing chips could have been placed in the cars," said a source in Lebanon who is close Qaeda-linked groups in Syria.

Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency center, said there was nothing to indicate Western plans for an attack on such groups in Syria right now.

"But they are essentially hedging their bets. There's too much to lose if no precautions are taken," he said. "Syria has provided jihadists with an incredibly valuable opportunity to establish a concrete foothold in the heart of the Middle East."

Syria, which sits on the faultlines of several sectarian and ethnic conflicts in the region, has been mired in 2-1/2 years of conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people.

Foreign powers have been deadlocked over action, and Western forces have grown increasingly hesitant as radical Islamist groups rose to power in an uprising that began as peaceful protests against four decades of Assad family rule.

But U.S. President Barack Obama has said chemical weapons use would cross a "red line" and has vowed to take action.

SHARING TIPS ONLINE

Militants have been trading advice online about going into hiding - from tips about food stockpiling to strategic advice on pre-planning attacks to maintain operations while leaders were in hiding.

Lister said lessons from attacks on militants in Mali, Iraq and Afghanistan were being shared on the Internet.

Abdullah Saqr, linked to the Fateh al-Islam group that has roots in Lebanon, posted some of his advice on Twitter.

"Start changing your locations and finding shelters, do not move in announced or large convoys. Take the mobile phones from all your fighters and distance them from the leadership to maintain a security layer," he wrote.

"My brothers, the situation is serious, it's not a joke. The Americans are being tricky in timing the attacks, which means it will be nothing more than a surprise attack as happened in Afghanistan or Iraq."

The Islamist source close to the Qaeda groups in Syria said fighters had already redeployed in new hideouts "away from prying eyes", but declined to give further details.

Activists in rebel-held parts of the northern city of Aleppo said they saw ISIL fighters leaving their bases in large numbers.

Nusra forces worked more secretly, they said, perhaps better timing their movements at night to avoid attention.

"They cleared out their main headquarters and much of the city. All they left behind were a few guards," said an activist in Aleppo, speaking by Skype.

"The others left behind were their social service and proselytizing groups. These groups cannot abandon the people."

opting signature policy issues of her main challenger in September's elections.

Merkel, who confronts leftist leader Peer Steinbrueck in a TV duel on Sunday, said she wanted to urge leaders of the G20 top world economies to agree a time frame for steps towards tighter regulation of the so-called "shadow banking" sector.

A key pillar of the campaign of Steinbrueck, who is trailing Merkel badly in opinion polls, has been to denounce what he calls the "dictatorship of financial markets".

World leaders meet on September 5-6 in Russia to negotiate the final piece of their financial crisis regulatory reforms, rules for this sector, an assortment of financial intermediaries such as hedge funds that handle $60 trillion of transactions a year - roughly the same size as the global economy.

"I want us to agree a binding time frame so it is clear when we reach which steps on this," said Merkel, leader of Germany's conservatives, in a video podcast on Saturday.

"Regulation is still faltering here".

left Social Democrats (SPD), has long argued policymakers have not gone far enough in tightening regulation to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis. In 2010, he told Reuters "we do not yet have a legal framework to significantly curtail the shadow banking sector, if not dissolve it."

Merkel said in her podcast Germany would ensure that the G20 continues to tighten regulation of financial markets, recalling its goal "to regulate every financial market actor, every financial product, and every financial center".

She added that she expected progress on the issue of tax evasion. "Here we will agree with the most powerful economies on an automatic exchange of information".

Steinbrueck led a crackdown on tax evasion when he was German finance minister in Merkel's 2005-2009 'grand coalition' government of conservatives and SPD.

His party helped block an attempt by Merkel's government last year to sign a bilateral deal with Switzerland that would have imposed taxes on assets stashed by German citizens. The SPD said the deal would have let off tax evaders too easily.

In a poll released earlier this year, over two-thirds of Germans thought Germany did not do enough against tax evasion.

Nonetheless opinion polls give Merkel's conservative bloc, which includes her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), a 15-19 point lead over Steinbrueck's SPD.

That virtually guarantees Merkel will remain chancellor. But it is unclear whether she will get enough votes to continue her coalition with the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP).

Should she fall short, Merkel would probably be forced into difficult talks with the SPD. So despite a formidable lead, Merkel cannot relax: the 1-1/2 hour prime-time debate on Sunday may be decisive for the shape of the next government.

headline: Pope names diplomat as chief aide, changing tone at Vatican
byline: By Philip Pullella
6:20pm EDT

Pope Francis attempted to set a new tone for a Vatican beset by scandals on Saturday by naming a veteran diplomat as secretary of state, a role often called the "deputy pope".

Archbishop Pietro Parolin's appointment ends the era of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who was widely blamed for failing to prevent ethical and financial scandals that marked the eight-year reign of former Pope Benedict, who resigned in February.

Parolin, a 58-year-old Italian who, like Francis, is known for his frugal lifestyle, is currently the Vatican's nuncio (ambassador) in Venezuela.

The naming of a new secretary of state - who acts as the pope's prime minister and chief aide - is the most significant appointment by Francis since his election in March.

Although he has no power to rule on doctrinal issues, the secretary of state sits in when the pope is ill.

He sets the tone for the Vatican's central administration, known as the Curia, and is involved in everything from finances and the appointment of bishops to diplomatic relations with more than 170 countries.

Bertone, 79, who was secretary of state for nearly all of Benedict's pontificate, was accused of not keeping a close enough watch on the Curia, some of whose members have been accused of corruption and cronyism.

One of the most damaging scandals to hit the Vatican under Bertone was "Vatileaks", when Benedict's butler stole documents alleging corruption from the pope's desk and leaked them to the media.

That coincided with tumult at the Vatican bank, which Italian magistrates are investigating on suspicion of money laundering.

The former president of the bank, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, was close to Bertone. The board of the bank, officially known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR), ousted Gotti Tedeschi last year, saying he was incompetent. He says he was pushed out because he wanted the bank to be more transparent.

Saturday's appointment was the pope's fourth move to overhaul the Vatican's central administration.

A month after his election, he set up an advisory board of eight cardinals to help him govern the 1.2 billion-member Roman Catholic Church and reform the Curia.

He has also set up another commission to advise him on how to reform the Vatican bank, ordered tighter supervision of the financial institute and set up a third commission of external experts to advise him on economic affairs, improve transparency and enforce accounting principles.

Parolin was the Vatican's deputy foreign minister for seven years until 2009 and has also served in Nigeria and Mexico.

6:20pm EDT

U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay hit out against the Sri Lanka government on Saturday, saying that four years after the end of civil war people were still suffering amid signs the country was headed in an authoritarian direction.

"It is important everyone realize that although the fighting is over, the suffering is not," Pillay told a news conference at the end of a controversial fact-finding mission to assess Sri Lanka's progress after the 26-year war between the government and separatist Tamils.

"I'm deeply concerned that Sri Lanka, despite the opportunity provided by the end of the war to construct a new vibrant, all-embracing state, is showing signs of heading in an increasingly authoritarian direction."

Pillay visited the former northern war zones in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and the eastern district of Trincomalee, and met leaders in the capital of Colombo. The visit has sparked demonstrations for and against her mission.

Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa told the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights on Friday that his people believed the U.N. is a biased organization, and a report she was due to release next month had already prejudged the country.

A U.N. panel has said it has "credible allegations" that both sides committed atrocities and war crimes, and singled out the government for most of the blame.

Pillay said the reconstruction and the redevelopment are important achievements in the former war zones.

"However, physical reconstruction alone will not bring reconciliation, dignity, or lasting peace," Pillay said. "Clearly, a more holistic approach is needed to provide truth, justice and reparations of people's suffering during the war."

She also said that she was concerned about the degree to which the "military appears to be putting down roots and becoming involved in what should be civilian activities, for instance education, agriculture and even tourism."

Pillay's visit followed a second U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution in March this year that urged Sri Lanka to carry out credible investigations into killings and disappearances during the civil war, especially in the final stages.

Sri Lanka has come under international pressure to bring to book those accused of war crimes and boost efforts to reconcile a polarized country. It has rejected the accusations of rights abuses, but Rajapaksa last month ordered an inquiry into mass disappearances.

Assad for the "brutal and flagrant" chemical weapons attack that it says killed more than 1,400 people in Damascus last week.

"We can not accept a world where women and children and innocent civilians are gassed on a terrible scale," President Barack Obama told reporters at the White House.

He said the United States was still in the planning process for a "limited, narrow" military response that would not involve "boots on the ground" or be open-ended. He set no timetable for action.

Secretary of State John Kerry said it was essential not to let Syria get away with the attack, partly as a sign to those who might consider using chemical weapons in the future.

"History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator's wanton use of weapons of mass destruction," Kerry said in a televised statement.

Syria's foreign ministry repeated the government's denial that it had used chemical weapons and said Kerry's accusations were a "desperate attempt" to justify a military strike. "What he said was lies," the ministry said of Kerry's statement.

With France on Friday affirming its support for a military response to punish Assad's government, the statements from Obama and Kerry appeared to harden the resolve for a U.S. attack despite Thursday's British parliamentary "no" vote that left Washington without one of its closest allies.

The timing of the attack, most likely with cruise missiles from U.S. Navy destroyers already stationed in the eastern Mediterranean, was uncertain, but it was unlikely to come before U.N. weapons experts leave Syria on Saturday.

Kerry said that "if a thug and a murderer like Bashar al-Assad can gas thousands of his own people with impunity," it would set a bad example for others, such as Iran, Hezbollah and North Korea.

Obama said chemical weapons attacks such as last week's threatened U.S. national security interests as well as U.S. allies such as Israel, Turkey and Jordan.

"So, I have said before, and I meant what I said, that the world has an obligation to make sure that we maintain the norm against the use of chemical weapons," he said.

Kerry laid out a raft of evidence he said showed Assad's forces were behind the attack, and the U.S. government released an unclassified intelligence report at the same time including many of the details. The report said the August 21 attack killed 1,429 Syrian civilians, including 426 children.

The intelligence included an intercepted communication by a senior official intimately familiar with the attack as well as other intelligence from people's accounts and intercepted messages, the four-page report said.

"Any action that he (Obama) might decide to take will be (a) limited and tailored response to ensure that a despot's brutal and flagrant use of chemical weapons is held accountable," Kerry said.

Assad's government has accused rebels of perpetrating the attacks in order to provoke intervention.

Syrian state television, which did not carry Kerry's speech live, reported that Kerry said the "first and last" aim of any action the Obama administration will carry out in the Middle East was to "guarantee the security of Israel."

Kerry said the U.N. inspectors' report would only confirm that chemical weapons were used and made clear it would not change much for Washington since "guaranteed Russian obstructionism" would make it impossible for the U.N. to galvanize world action.

"The primary question is really no longer, what do we know? The question is, what are we - we collectively - what are we in the world going to do about it?" Kerry said.

The timing of any strikes may be complicated by Obama's departure late on Tuesday for Sweden and a G20 summit in Russia.

SHIFTING ALLIANCES

Kerry and Obama were speaking the day after British Prime Minister David Cameron failed to win parliamentary backing for military action in Syria.

Finance minister George Osborne, one of Cameron's closest allies, accepted that the vote had raised questions about Britain's future relations with its allies.

French President Francois Hollande told the daily Le Monde he still supported taking "firm" punitive action over an attack he said had caused "irreparable" harm to the Syrian people.

Hollande is not constrained by the need for parliamentary approval of any move to intervene in Syria and could act before lawmakers debate the issue on Wednesday. An official in his office said the French president spoke to Obama on Friday and "they showed great determination about this crisis."

Britain has traditionally been the United States' most reliable military ally. However, the defeat of the government motion authorizing a military response in principle underscored misgivings dating from how the country decided to join the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Russia, Assad's most powerful diplomatic ally, opposes any military intervention in Syria, saying an attack would increase tension and undermine the chances of ending the civil war.

Yuri Ushakov, senior foreign policy adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the British vote represented majority opinion in Europe.

"People are beginning to understand how dangerous such scenarios are," he told reporters. "Russia is actively working to avert a military scenario in Syria.

Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said any intervention in Syria should be aimed at ending Assad's rule - a goal that Obama has ruled out.

U.S. CAUTION

Kerry said the U.S. intelligence community had carefully reviewed and re-reviewed information regarding the attack. "I will tell you it has done so more than mindful of the Iraq experience. We will not repeat that moment."

Kerry said that three days before the attack, the Syrian government's chemical weapons personnel were on the ground in the area, making preparations.

"And we know that the Syrian regime elements were told to prepare for the attack by putting on gas masks and taking precautions associated with chemical weapons."

"We know that a senior regime official who knew about the attack confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime, reviewed the impact, and actually was afraid that they would be discovered," Kerry said.

Assad's forces fired rockets on Friday at a Damascus suburb hit by poison gas last week in another attempt to capture the strategic area, opposition activists said.

Polls show the American public is largely opposed to U.S. military action, and after a Thursday briefing some lawmakers said they were still not convinced of the need for it. Some questioned whether the Pentagon could afford to attack Syria after spending cuts imposed this year.

A new Reuters/Ipsos poll on Friday showed 53 percent of those surveyed this week said the United States should stay out of Syria's civil war, down from 60 percent last week. Twenty percent said the United States should take action, up from 9 percent last week.

Analysts said there was little doubt about the message from Obama's administration. "I would now be shocked if the U.S. government doesn't go to war, even if alone," said Bilal Saab, director and head of research at the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis. "This is as clear a case for intervention, from the administration's standpoint, as can be."

Some allies, including Italy, have warned that military action without U.N. Security Council authorisation may make matters worse. Russia holds veto power as a permanent Security Council member and has blocked three resolutions meant to press Assad to stop the violence since the revolt began in 2011.

Western diplomats have been seeking a vote in the 15-member Council on a draft measure, which would authorize "all necessary force" in response to the suspected gas attack, to isolate Moscow and show that other nations back military action.

But China said there should be no rush to force a council decision on Syria until the U.N. inspectors complete their work.

The United Nations said its experts had completed the collection of samples and evidence from last week's attack. U.N. spokesman Martin Nasik said all the analysis of the samples must be completed before conclusions can be drawn.

Diplomats said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told Security Council members it may be two weeks before final results of the tests are ready.

headline: U.N. investigators to exit Syria, chemical probe may take weeks
byline: By Louis Charbonneau
6:20pm EDT

A team of U.N. experts finished gathering evidence of a suspected chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds of people in suburbs near Damascus last week, the United Nations announced on Friday, though envoys said analyzing the samples may take weeks.

The announcement the U.N. inspectors will not be releasing their findings immediately came as Washington suggested the U.N. investigation would have no bearing on its decision about whether to attack Syria in retaliation for the alleged poison gas attack on civilians.

Russia, diplomats said, was hoping to use the time needed to complete the U.N. probe to slow down the push for air strikes. Washington has left the timing of any action unclear.

U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said the inspectors would be leaving Syria on Saturday but would return later to investigate several other alleged poison gas attacks that have taken place in Syria during the country's 2-1/2-year civil war.

"The samples that have been collected will be taken to be analyzed in designated laboratories, and the intention of course is to expedite the analysis of that sampling that's been taken," Nesirky said.

He offered no timeline for when that analysis would be completed, but said all samples would need to be fully analyzed.

"This is not an electoral process, where you have exit polls and preliminary results," he said. "This is a scientific process. The only result that counts is the result of the analysis in laboratories and the analysis of the evidence that's been collected through witness statements and so on."

He was addressing reporters while U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was meeting with delegates from the five permanent U.N. Security Council members - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - to update them on the U.N. investigation in Syria. Envoys from the five countries gave no details of the meeting to reporters after it ended.

But two diplomats told Reuters that Ban informed the five delegations that analysis of the samples could take up to two weeks.

Ban cut short a visit to Europe amid concerns that Western powers are preparing military strikes against Syria to punish the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the chemical attack. Assad's government, like Syria's ally Russia, blames the rebels for the attack.

France said on Friday it still backed military action to punish Assad's government, and Washington pushed ahead with plans for a response despite a British parliamentary vote against a military strike.

An unclassified report by U.S. intelligence agencies released on Friday said the attack killed 1,429 Syrian civilians, including 426 children.

NO TIMELINE

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday the U.N. experts could not provide the United States with anything it did not already know about the August 21 incident.

The U.N. inspectors' mandate dictates they will only seek to determine whether chemical weapons were used, not who used them. Western diplomats said that limitation undermined the usefulness of the inspectors' findings.

Shortly afterward, U.S. President Barack Obama blasted the U.N. Security Council for its "incapacity ... to move forward in the face of a clear violation of international norms."

Russia, backed by China, has used its veto power in the Security Council three times to block resolutions condemning Assad's government and threatening it with sanctions.

U.N. diplomats said that Russia, anticipating military action against Syria soon, might call an emergency meeting of the 15-nation council over the weekend to urge countries to wait for the U.N. investigation results before making any decisions.

"Russia wants to use the Security Council and the time it takes to produce a report on the U.N. investigation to slow down the momentum toward action," a Western diplomat told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

U.N. officials say the world body's findings will be important because they will be widely seen as irrefutable, in contrast to doubts that arise with intelligence in light of the erroneous information on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs that was used to justify the 2003 invasion.

Asked about rumors that all the U.N. investigators had left Syria already, Nesirky said the experts were still there and would be departing on Saturday, although translators and some support staff had already left.

Earlier this week, Syria's U.N. envoy asked the United Nations to order chemical experts in Damascus to investigate three rebel attacks in which he said Syrian troops "inhaled poisonous gas."

Nesirky said the team began an inquiry into those allegations on Friday.

"Today the mission visited a government military hospital in Damascus as part of its evaluation of information provided by Syria on that," he said, adding that the experts would continue searching for evidence when they return to Syria.

The United States dismissed the appeal by Syria's U.N. envoy, saying it had stonewalled the U.N. experts for months.

The United Nations has received at least 14 reports of possible chemical weapons use in Syria. After months of diplomatic wrangling, the U.N. experts, led by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom, arrived in Syria on August 18 with a 14-day mandate to visit the country.

The U.N. team was initially going to look into three incidents, but its priority became last week's attack.



headline: In shadow of Iraq, U.S. has 'high confidence' Syria carried out chemical attack
byline: By Tabassum Zakaria and Mark Hosenball
5:56pm EDT

Assad carried out a chemical weapons attack on neighborhoods outside Damascus.

But the declassified intelligence report also showed what the U.S. government does not have: clear evidence that Assad personally ordered the attack, and physiological evidence confirming what caused the deaths of an estimated 1,429 Syrians on August 21.

U.S. officials insisted that because of the way the Syrian government and its chemical weapons program operates, Assad's government bears clear responsibility for the attack.

"We have a high-confidence assessment that a chemical weapons attack took place and that the Assad regime was responsible," a senior administration official told reporters in a conference call after the declassified intelligence report was released.

President Barack Obama's administration made clear on Friday that it would punish Assad for the "brutal and flagrant" attack.

The intelligence was compiled from human sources, electronic intercepts and satellite imagery, as well as public sources such as social media and reports by non-governmental organizations and medical groups.

U.S. intelligence about weapons of mass destruction has been suspect since spy agencies, with encouragement from senior officials in President George W. Bush's administration, reported in 2002 that Iraq had active chemical, nuclear and biological weapons programs. The findings were used to justify the 2003 U.S. invasion to topple Saddam Hussein, but no such programs were discovered.

"Our intelligence community has carefully reviewed and re-reviewed information regarding this attack. And I will tell you it has done so more than mindful of the Iraq experience. We will not repeat that moment," Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday.

A team of U.N. investigators in Damascus was due to leave Syria on Saturday, but a U.N. spokesman said it would take time to complete its analysis.

moon informed the five permanent Security Council members that analysis of the samples collected by the inspectors could take up to two weeks.

Kerry said the team's mandate was limited to determining whether a chemical attack occurred - not who was responsible - and that Washington had no doubt on either score.

Syria's Foreign Ministry repeated the government's denial it had used chemical weapons and said Kerry's accusations were a "desperate attempt" to justify a military strike.

'CHAIN OF COMMAND'

The four-page intelligence assessment did not include raw data, such as transcripts of intercepted communications, which U.S. officials said must stay classified to protect sources and methods.

The document rejects allegations - made by the Syrian government and its ally Russia, among others - that anti-Assad rebels staged the attack. The rebels have neither the type of rockets and artillery used in the attack, nor the capability to fabricate videos seen on social media or symptoms verified by medical personnel, it said.

The intercepted communications showed the involvement of high-level Syrian government officials, U.S. officials said.

"We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were being used by the regime on August 21st and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence," a senior administration official said.

The officials also pointed to intelligence showing that, in the run-up to the attack, personnel from the Syrian government agency that conducts non-conventional weapons development and the Defense Ministry chain of command were involved in preparations. At some point, intelligence information also indicated that the Syrian chain of command ordered chemical weapons attacks to stop, they said.

Those events "implicate different individuals who have a connection to the Syrian regime and, specifically, its chemical weapons program," said one official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

"It wasn't just the preparations that we detected in those three days in advance of Wednesday - it was also the people that were involved. They were the people that are responsible for his program. There is a chain of command from Assad to them," an official added.

U.S. security sources said one Syrian official whose activities were under examination was Maher Assad, younger brother of the president and commander of Syria's Republican Guard and an elite armored division. What role, if any, he played in the attack is still unclear, they said.

MARSHALING SUPPORT

In releasing the report, Obama and his aides were seeking to marshal public and congressional support for what Obama has said might be a "tailored, limited" military strike on Syria to deter further chemical weapons use.

The effort has been complicated by the Iraq experience, which helped drive Britain's decision on Thursday not to take part in any Syria campaign.

A declassified October 2002 U.S. National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's WMD programs said there was "high confidence" that Iraq was holding on to, and in some areas expanding, its chemical, biological, nuclear and missile programs.

The intelligence report on Syria released on Friday used the same terminology, adding, "Our high confidence assessment is the strongest position that the U.S. Intelligence Community can take short of confirmation."

The report said Syrian forces began making visible preparations for what turned out to be a chemical attack three days before the event, including "utilization" of gas masks.

Syrian government forces early on August 21 began to launch rockets and artillery from a government-controlled area against neighborhoods where rebels had maintained a stubborn and persistent presence, the report said.

One official said the government had been trying to clear the area of rebels for some time, possibly so that it could re-deploy its forces to crack down on rebels in the major Syrian city of Aleppo.

A few hours after the initial assault, social media began reporting what the United States now believes was a chemical attack from at least 12 locations in the Damascus area where suspected chemical-filled rockets were fired into rebel-controlled areas.

The intelligence report said a "nerve agent" was used in the attack, but did not specify which one and said the Syrian government maintains a stockpile of "numerous chemical agents" including mustard, sarin, and VX.



headline: Suriname president's son arrested on U.S. drug smuggling charges
byline: By Lomi Kriel
6:20pm EDT

A son of Suriname's president has been arrested in Panama and sent to New York to face charges of smuggling cocaine into the United States, U.S. authorities said on Friday.

An indictment against Dino Bouterse filed in a federal court in the Southern District of New York, alleges the 40-year-old imported more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States between December 2011 and August 2013.

Bouterse was arrested at Panama's Tocumen International Airport on Thursday, authorities said.

He was arraigned on Friday in a Manhattan federal court for conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States and for carrying a firearm or destructive device - an anti-tank rocket launcher and pistols - during a drug-related crime.

Both charges carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.

According to the indictment, a man named Edmund Quincy Muntslag traveled to Suriname on July 25 to arrange the transport of 10 kilograms of cocaine to the United States.

On July 27, the indictment alleges, Bouterse "caused a suitcase containing 10 kilograms of cocaine to be transported from Suriname to the Caribbean on board a commercial flight."

Muntslag was arrested in Trinidad and Tobago on Thursday and charged with drug trafficking, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

Bouterse's father, Desi, is a former military dictator accused of human rights violations, including the killings of 15 political opponents in December 1982. He ruled the tiny South American country from 1980 to 1987, and reclaimed power in 2010.

Following Dino's arrest, President Bouterse postponed his opening statement at the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) summit in Suriname's capital, Paramaribo, by three hours.

"I have heard about the news, but, at this moment, I am concentrating on the UNASUR meeting," he told reporters shortly before opening the conference, declining to comment further.

Suriname's Foreign Ministry said in a statement it was "monitoring developments closely."

In a statement, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Special-Agent-in-Charge Derek Maltz said Dino Bouterse had a "history of drug and weapons trafficking."

A judge in Suriname sentenced the younger Bouterse to eight years in prison in 2005 for trafficking drugs, illegal weapons and stolen luxury cars. Nevertheless, his father gave him a senior post in the country's counterterrorism unit.

Desi Bouterse was convicted in absentia in the Netherlands in 1999 for smuggling more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine to that country, but he never served any prison time as Suriname does not have an extradition treaty with the Netherlands.

Since being elected president in 2010, the elder Bouterse has obtained diplomatic immunity against the charges and Interpol dropped its arrest warrant for him.



headline: Mexico leftist vows to block reforms, warns oil firms
byline: By Simon Gardner
3:59pm EDT

Fiery Mexican leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to stop the government's energy and tax reforms and hopes to lead even bigger protests than when he brought central Mexico City to a standstill after narrowly losing the 2006 presidential election.

A colorful renegade and a former Mexico City mayor, Lopez Obrador accuses President Enrique Pena Nieto of trying to sell off Mexico's assets by seeking to lure foreign capital into the state-controlled energy sector.

Pledging to battle what he calls a planned privatization of Mexico's vast oil reserves, Lopez Obrador swears he will work to undermine any contracts agreed with the government.

"We're not going to stop until we manage to block these reforms," he told Reuters in an interview on Friday in a lush, lakeside garden in Catemaco in the Gulf state of Veracruz.

Pena Nieto has pinned his hopes of ramping up lackluster growth in Latin America's second largest economy on attracting more investment into the oil industry, and improving Mexico's meager tax revenues.

In 2006, Lopez Obrador drew hundreds of thousands of supporters onto the streets of Mexico City to protest when he lost the presidency to Pena Nieto's predecessor, Felipe Calderon, by less than 1 percentage point.

Declaring himself Mexico's legitimate president, his demonstrations triggered transport chaos, choked tourism in the capital and prompted businesses to shutter storefronts.

After losing to Pena Nieto in last year's election, he again claimed he was robbed and led new protests, but they were more subdued.

Now, the 59-year-old is seeking to take to the streets at a time when other protests have already started to disrupt life in the capital. Since last week, militant teachers have staged blockades in Mexico City against an education reform that Pena Nieto has said is also central to the country's future.

On September 8, the very day Pena Nieto is expected to unveil his fiscal reform, Lopez Obrador plans to launch an anti-reform protest at the heart of the city he once governed.

The silver-haired firebrand would not be drawn on whether he planned indefinite street protests, saying he had yet to decide - but he hoped that they will be "the same as or bigger (than 2006) because the circumstances call for it."

"We are going to struggle peacefully, without falling into the trap of violence, to prevent the privatization of oil and tax increases," he said in Veracruz.

Pena Nieto insists he is against privatizing Pemex and has no plans to list the company. His pending fiscal reform is expected to tax food and medicine, a political hot potato Lopez Obrador is also firmly against.

Only if the government agrees to put the reform proposals to public referendums will he relent, Lopez Obrador said.

Pena Nieto wants to change the constitution to give private companies incentives to invest in oil and gas fields alongside lumbering state oil monopoly Pemex, whose output has fallen by a quarter since peaking in 2004.

BIGGEST THEFT 'OF ALL TIME'

Lopez Obrador also had a message for oil companies that may sign contracts to share in profits tapping Mexico's oil: he will do all he can to cancel them if he ever comes to power. He called the oil reform the biggest theft "of all time".

"I have a recommendation, not a warning, for foreign oil companies," he said. "Think clearly, because a franchise from an illegitimate government is not enough. We are not going to stop insisting the oil is ours. And we will get it back."

"They have no certainty. Let it be clear to them that we are not going to allow it because we see it as a robbery of the Mexican people and the nation," he added.

Once a member of Pena Nieto's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Lopez Obrador defected in 1988 to help found the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD.

He later split with the PRD too and now constantly travels the country, campaigning against Pena Nieto's reform plans with an eye on the next presidential race in 2018.

He founded his own political movement and has the backing of some small left-wing parties as well as many lower-income supporters who have traditionally backed the PRD.

The PRD is also against changing the constitution to open up the oil sector, but has kept its distance from Lopez Obrador.

"He has chosen his path, his own strategy, and we have chosen ours," said the PRD's chairman, Jesus Zambrano.

Whether Lopez Obrador, often known by his initials AMLO, can disrupt the reforms may depend on whether the government can defuse the teachers' protests. Otherwise the demonstrations could snowball and shake the nerve of Congress.

"I don't think AMLO at this point can do more than create a cacophony," said George Grayson, a Mexico expert at the College of William and Mary in Virginia and biographer of Lopez Obrador.

"A lot will depend on whether or not (Pena Nieto) can achieve a reasonable understanding with the teachers," Grayson added. "If Pena Nieto capitulates with the teachers, it's going to change the dynamics and it's going to make it easier for someone like Lopez Obrador to mobilize support."

So far, Pena Nieto has shown a deft touch in dealing with Congress, where he lacks a majority.

Right after taking office, he sealed a pact with opposition leaders to negotiate reforms and key figures from those ranks are still holding the line.

"Even with people on the street, we need to push through the energy and tax reforms," said Jose Trejo, a senior lawmaker from the opposition conservative National Action Party, or PAN, who heads the finance committee in the lower house.



headline: Sixth U.S. ship now in eastern Mediterranean 'as precaution'
byline: By Andrea Shalal-Esa
6:20pm EDT

A sixth U.S. warship is now operating in the eastern Mediterranean, near five U.S. destroyers armed with cruise missiles that could soon be directed against Syria as part of a "limited, precise" strike, defense officials said late on Friday.

They stressed that the USS San Antonio, an amphibious ship with several hundred U.S. Marines on board, was in the region for a different reason and there were no plans to put Marines on the ground as part of any military action against Syria.

One of the officials said the San Antonio's passage into the Mediterranean was long-planned, but officials thought it prudent to keep the ship in the eastern Mediterranean near the destroyers given the current situation.

"It's been kept there as a precaution," said one of the officials, who was not authorized to speak publicly.

The San Antonio transited through the Suez Canal on Thursday from the Red Sea, and received new orders on Friday to remain in the eastern Mediterranean, near the destroyers, according to defense officials. It is one of three ships that are carrying 2,200 Marines who have been on a six-month deployment in the region around the Arabian peninsula.

The Obama administration released evidence on Friday that it said demonstrated the Syrian government had used chemical weapons against civilians. It made clear on Friday that it would punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the "brutal and flagrant" attack that it says killed more than 1,400 people in Damascus last week.

Officials cautioned the operation under discussion involved a limited, precise set of targets that would be of a short duration, unlike the broader campaign against Libya in March 2011.

The U.S. Navy generally keeps three destroyers in the Mediterranean, but kept two additional destroyers there at the end of their deployments as the situation evolved in Syria over the past week.

The five destroyers are each carrying an estimated three dozen or more Tomahawk missiles for a combined total of about 200 missiles, according to defense officials.

Byron Callan, analyst with Capital Alpha Partners, projected that a limited Syrian strike would use about 200 to 300 Tomahawk missiles, compared to about 221 used in the Libya operation.

Defense officials said a more narrowly targeted operation against Syria could involve even less missiles.

They cited a debate within the Obama administration about striking the right balance between a limited cruise missile attack aimed at delivering a message about chemical weapons, and a broader attack that could be seen as a strong insertion of the United States into the Syrian civil war.

Military and civilian officials have expressed the need for caution to avert a cascading military conflict that could have repercussions throughout the region. Some officials have cautioned that even an attack on military helicopters could be seen as part of a U.S. campaign to disable the Syrian military.

Retired Admiral Gary Roughead, who served as chief of naval operations during the 2011 strikes on Libya, said any strike on Syria would have to be targeted precisely to do the maximum amount of damage to Syrian military headquarters and other key sites - and to avert the possibility of retaliatory action.

"If you're going to try to shape events, you really need to hurt them," said Roughead, now a visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. "You would have to do something that would diminish the effectiveness of the Syrian military and that would be their command and control, perhaps their leadership, and then their ability to control air space."

led air strikes.

Thousands of loyal security forces and militia, meanwhile, have moved into schools and residential buildings in Damascus, mixing with the civilian population in the hope of escaping a Western strike, according to residents and opposition activists.

U.S. President Barack Obama says a "tailored, limited" strike would send a strong message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that use of chemical weapons cannot be tolerated after an alleged attack last week killed hundreds of people.

Officials in Washington, rejecting comparisons with the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, say any campaign would likely include cruise missiles from U.S. ships in the Mediterranean, last only days and target military installations including air defenses.

They may, however, involve casualties among the Sunni Muslim majority that has led the revolt against Assad.

Some military and security bases are used as prisons for civilian detainees, human rights groups say, and rebels who have fled their posts say many soldiers of a low rank are imprisoned on military sites because they are Sunnis.

Most of the commanding officers are from Assad's Alawite sect, an off-shoot of Shi'ite Islam, and fear their subordinates will defect, flee their posts or coordinate with rebel units, defectors say.

"Some soldiers are physically locked up in rooms and others are given small jobs to do around the base but their weapons are taken from them. They are not taken out of the base," said an ex-soldier who, until three months ago, worked at an artillery base on the outskirts of Damascus.

He said he was able to flee his post after he became ill and was taken to hospital, where he escaped and hoped his superiors would not report his disappearance due to the chaos of war.

The man, who spoke by telephone, asked to remain anonymous to protect his family who live in government-held territory. He said that trapped soldiers would likely die in military strikes.

Also asking to remain anonymous, a rebel from the northern province of Idlib said his unit was allowed to exit the barracks to fight on the frontlines of Aleppo, but under duress and the threat of execution for desertion.

"One day I was fighting and I was separated from my unit. The revolutionaries called out to me and I crossed over to them."

"I am worried that the strikes will hit the imprisoned soldiers," he said, but added that he also hoped a strike on Assad's military would prevent further deaths.

One former senior U.S. official said reports of Syrian soldiers being held by their superiors as possible human shields underscored the importance of choosing the appropriate targets for cruise missile strikes.

"It is a really hard problem," said the former official. "Any strikes will be claimed by the regime to have killed innocents or the wrong people."

IMPRISONMENT

Since civil war broke out in 2011, conscripts have no longer been allowed to take annual leave and their two-year military service has been extended indefinitely, defectors say.

The army would rather incur the cost of imprisoning Sunni soldiers than run the risk of defection, say rebels, who estimate thousands of Syrian Sunnis are held at military sites.

Many talk of a brother, friend or family member who has not been heard from and is suspected of being trapped.

It was not clear whether the bases where they say soldiers are held included possible U.S. targets, and Pentagon officials were not immediately available for comment. The U.S. military says it works hard to avoid civilian and unintended casualties.

Opposition activists say that in anticipation of U.S. strikes, the army has started moving personnel and military equipment, including Scud missiles, to protect supplies.

Many of those working in secret police compounds that dominate the capital have also moved - into schools and civilian buildings, residents, diplomats and opposition activists said.

A woman living in the western Kfar Souseh district, which is home to Military Intelligence and other security compounds, said security personnel armed with AK-47s rifles and carrying radios had taken up residence in the basement of her apartment bloc.

"They are loudly playing the song 'We Are Your Army Bashar,'" she said. "Imagine if you are living somewhere for years and 60 gunmen you don't know suddenly barge into your building and live there," she said.

Activist Moaz al-Shami, who is compiling a list of schools where security and pro-Assad militia have moved in, said they concentrated in Baramkeh, Tishreen Park, Sha'lan, Abu Rummaneh, Mezze and Malki, among the most heavily fortified districts of the capital and home to many top army and intelligence officers.

"If those schools get hit the risk to civilians around them could be greater and the regime can accuse the United States of indiscriminate bombing and targeting civilians," Shami said.

Diplomats said rebel raids and fighting near key roads had blocked a wider evacuation of the hundreds of security and army bases that dot the country of 22 million, where Assad's late father imposed his autocratic dynasty four decades ago.

Khaled Saleh, a spokesman for the opposition Syrian National Coalition, said as well as personnel movements out of military sites, prisoners had been put in barracks as human shields.

"The Assad regime is starting to move large numbers of prisoners into army barracks. Over the last three days, they are moving soldiers into schools and hospitals," he said in Istanbul.

soldiers, due to security and reporting restrictions in Syria. Attempts to reach Syrian officials for comment on this story were unsuccessful.

Peter Splinter, Amnesty International's representative to the U.N. in Geneva, said his rights group did not have confirmation prisoners were being moved but was very concerned about thousands of detainees already in military and security bases that may be targeted.

He said authorities had partly transformed some military bases into detention facilities since the start of the uprising because of the large number of arrests.

The conflict started with a peaceful pro-democracy movement against four decades of Assad family rule but became armed after a crackdown by security forces. Attacks have included incendiary and cluster bombs, as well as summary executions, and the United Nations says 100,000 people have been killed.



headline: Six dead as thousands of Mursi supporters march in Egypt
byline: By Maggie Fick
6:20pm EDT

Thousands of supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohamed Mursi marched through Cairo and cities across Egypt on Friday to demand his reinstatement, in the movement's biggest show of defiance since hundreds of protesters were killed two weeks ago.

Although most marches passed without major incident, a security source said there had been at least six deaths, and police fired teargas at protesters in Cairo's Mohandiseen district.

The army-backed government, which has shot dead hundreds of supporters of Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood since he was toppled by the military on July 3, had warned that forces posted at key intersections since morning would open fire if protests turned violent.

Having arrested most of the Brotherhood's leaders, it hoped by now to have suffocated the protests against its decision to force out and crush the movement that ruled Egypt for a year.

But its prospects of presenting a return to normality looked to have been set back by live television pictures of teargas and burning tyres in Cairo, as well as the sheer number of separate marches that the well-organized Brotherhood managed to stage.

The security source said there had been at least 50 injured throughout Egypt, in addition to the six dead, and more than 20 arrests. The cabinet issued a statement after the protests saying that anyone who disregarded the curfew would face legal consequences.

SCATTERED PROTESTS

The demonstrators appeared mostly to have opted for numerous scattered protests, avoiding Cairo's bigger squares or the scenes of earlier protests such as the pro-Mursi street camps where security forces shot dead more than 600 people on August 14.

Just after Friday prayers, around 500 protesters set off from central Cairo's Sahib Rumi mosque, chanting: "Wake up, don't be afraid, the army must leave", "The Interior Ministry are thugs" and "Egypt is Islamic, not secular".

By mid-afternoon, thousands were marching in districts across Cairo calling for the return of the elected government, and some remained outside the presidential palace in the capital until just before the 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) curfew.

Soldiers and helmeted police in black uniforms and bulletproof vests, armed with teargas and semi-automatic rifles, manned checkpoints near the protests and blocked roads.

In Egypt's second city, Alexandria, a total of more than 10,000 protesters took part in several separate demonstrations.

Marches were also held in several cities in the Nile Delta including Tanta, in the three Suez Canal cities of Suez, Ismailia and Port Said, and in the southern city of Assiut.

The Brotherhood's London press office circulated an email with links to video streams from what it said were protests in 15 districts of Cairo, as well as 32 in other towns and cities.

In the city of Fayoum, the private television channel CBC showed footage of a female Brotherhood supporter in a black head-to-toe veil, leading a march of veiled women and carrying a placard reading "Where did legitimacy go?".

"This revolutionary wave will not stop," Brotherhood politician Farid Ismail said by phone from an undisclosed location.

He said the numbers of those who had demonstrated despite "intimidation, teargas, live bullets and detentions" had been hugely underreported.

"This will continue in the coming weeks," he said.

Armed forces chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the government he backs appear to have won broad public support for their crackdown, which they portray in the largely state-controlled or pro-government media as a fight against terrorism.

MILLIONS ALIENATED

The Brotherhood, which won five popular votes after the overthrow of the military-backed president Hosni Mubarak in 2011, and gave Egypt its first civilian president in Mursi, says it is still committed to peaceful resistance.

For decades Egypt's only effective opposition group, despite being officially banned, the Brotherhood seized on the anti-Mubarak uprising to win the presidency.

But millions were alienated by its ideologically driven rule and failure to revive the economy, and took to the streets, giving the army-backed establishment its cue to act with more venom than ever against a group it had repressed for decades.

From early morning, armored vehicles fitted with machineguns guarded key points such as Tahrir Square, epicenter of the 2011 uprising, and Ramses Square, where more than 100 people, mostly Mursi supporters, were killed in protests two weeks ago. More than 100 members of the security forces have also been killed in the turmoil.

"Today's big turnout show the Brotherhood's ability to organize itself and proves its structure still stands," political analyst Mustapha Al-Sayyid said.

"This will pose a challenge on the authorities to end the protests and regain stability, or to decrease the curfew hours, which is the first step to bringing life back to normal."

The Egyptian-born Muslim cleric Sheikh Youssef al-Qaradawi earlier exhorted Egyptians to take to the streets.

"You Egyptians, go out, all of you, men, mothers, daughters even children. This is a religious duty on all Egyptians!" he said in a Friday sermon broadcast on Qatari state television.

The crackdown on Islamists has soured relations between Egypt and Qatar, a wealthy Gulf Arab state and U.S. ally that backed the Brotherhood and gave Egypt $7 billion during Mursi's administration.

headline: U.N. experts prepare to leave Syria, chemical probe needs time
byline: By Louis Charbonneau
6:20pm EDT

A team of U.N. investigators has finished gathering evidence related to a suspected chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds of people in suburbs near Damascus last week, but will need time to complete its analysis, the world body said on Friday.

The announcement the U.N. inspectors will not be releasing their findings immediately came as Washington suggested the U.N. investigation would have no bearing on its decision about whether to attack Syria in retaliation for the alleged poison gas attack on civilians.

Russia, diplomats said, was hoping to use the time needed to complete the U.N. probe to slow down any push for air strikes.

U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said the inspectors would be leaving Syria on Saturday but would return later to investigate several other alleged poison gas attacks that have taken place in Syria during the country's 2-1/2-year civil war.

"The samples that have been collected will be taken to be analyzed in designated laboratories and the intention of course is to expedite the analysis of that sampling that's been taken," Nesirky said.

He offered no timeline for when that analysis would be completed, but said all samples would need to be fully analyzed.

"This is not an electoral process, where you have exit polls and preliminary results," he said. "This is a scientific process. The only result that counts is the result of the analysis in laboratories and the analysis of the evidence that's been collected through witness statements and so on."

He was addressing reporters while U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was meeting with delegates from the five permanent U.N. Security Council members - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - to update them on the U.N. investigation in Syria. Envoys from the five countries gave no details of the meeting to reporters after it ended.

Ban cut short a visit to Europe amid concerns that Western powers are preparing military strikes against Syria to punish the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the chemical attack. Assad's government, like Syria's ally Russia, blames the rebels for the attack.

France said on Friday it still backed military action to punish Assad's government and Washington pushed ahead with plans for a response despite a British parliamentary vote against a military strike.

An unclassified report by U.S. intelligence agencies released on Friday said the attack killed 1,429 Syrian civilians, including 426 children.

NO TIMELINE

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday the U.N. experts could not provide the United States with anything it did not already know about the August 21 incident.

The U.N. inspectors' mandate dictates they will only seek to determine whether chemical weapons were used, not who used them. Western diplomats said that limitation undermined the usefulness of the inspectors' findings.

Shortly afterward, U.S. President Barack Obama blasted the U.N. Security Council for its "incapacity ... to move forward in the face of a clear violation of international norms."

Russia, backed by China, has used its veto power three times to block resolutions condemning Assad's government and threatening it with sanctions.

U.N. diplomats said that Russia, anticipating military action against Syria soon, might call an emergency meeting of the 15-nation council over the weekend to urge countries to wait for the U.N. investigation results before making any decisions.

"Russia wants to use the Security Council and the time it takes to produce a report on the U.N. investigation to slow down the momentum toward action," a Western diplomat told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

U.N. officials say the world body's findings will be important because they will be widely seen as irrefutable, in contrast to doubts that arise with intelligence in light of the erroneous information on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs that was used to justify the 2003 invasion.

Asked about rumors that all the U.N. investigators had left Syria already, Nesirky said the experts were still there and would be departing on Saturday, although translators and some support staff had already left.

Earlier this week, Syria's U.N. envoy asked the United Nations to order chemical experts in Damascus to investigate three rebel attacks in which he said Syrian troops "inhaled poisonous gas," while Britain pushed for the Security Council to act on the crisis.

Nesirky said the team began an inquiry into those allegations on Friday.

"Today the mission visited a government military hospital in Damascus as part of its evaluation of information provided by Syria on that," he said, adding that the investigators would continue investigating when they return to Syria.

The United States dismissed the appeal by Syria's U.N. envoy, saying it had stonewalled the U.N. experts for months.

The United Nations has received at least 14 reports of possible chemical weapons use in Syria. After months of diplomatic wrangling, the U.N. experts, led by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom, arrived in Syria on August 18 with a 14-day mandate to visit the country.

The U.N. team was initially going to look into three incidents, but its priority became last week's incident.



headline: Most in U.S. still oppose Syria strike as Obama seeks action
byline: By Andy Sullivan
6:20pm EDT

Most Americans still do not want to intervene in Syria's civil war, although support for such action has increased since the suspected chemical gas attack near Damascus last week, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.

The poll made clear how much work President Barack Obama has to do to win support for military action from a war-weary public as he makes the case that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be held responsible for the attack that the United States says killed more than 1,400 people.

Some 53 percent of those surveyed this week said the United States should stay out of Syria's civil war, down from 60 percent last week. Just 20 percent said the United States should take action, but that was up from 9 percent last week.

When asked whether the United States should intervene if Assad's government used chemical weapons on civilians, 29 percent of Americans said yes - up from 25 percent last week - while 44 percent opposed intervention even if chemicals have been used, down from 46 percent last week.

Support for U.S. involvement is not likely to climb much higher before any military action because most Americans are now fully aware of the situation in Syria and likely have made up their minds about it, Ipsos pollster Julia Clark said.

The Reuters/Ipsos online poll of 708 adult Americans was conducted Monday through Friday this week. It has a credibility interval, similar to a margin of error, of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points for each result.

Obama's administration has made clear that it will punish Assad for the attack, even as prominent allies such as Great Britain have resisted participation in any military operation.

But many Americans remain deeply reluctant to engage in further conflicts after more than a decade of expensive and inconclusive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

"Every time we get involved in somebody else's mess, we just get deeper in debt and nothing happens. They go right back to being just exactly as they've been for 200 years," said Dolly Benson, 71, of Romance, Arkansas.

The Obama administration says any strike would be limited in scope and would not in any way resemble the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan or Iraq.

"We know that after a decade of conflict, the American people are tired of war. Believe me, I am, too," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday. "But fatigue does not absolve us of our responsibility. Just longing for peace does not necessarily bring it about."

The poll was taken before Secretary of State John Kerry released on Friday an unclassified intelligence report that he said presented detailed evidence that Assad's forces were behind the attack.

Those surveyed in the poll were more likely to support action when they were specifically asked about chemical weapons, which are outlawed under international treaty. Obama has made limiting the spread of chemical, nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction a cornerstone of his foreign policy.

Even those who supported a U.S. intervention said they were worried that military action could further inflame a volatile region and expose the United States and its allies to a range of risks, including retaliation from Syria or its allies.

"It's a slippery slope; we have to tread lightly," said Baruch Jabbarr, 60, of Brooklyn, New York. "But I'm all for intervention because something has to be done."

5:56pm EDT

A Venezuelan man has been sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison for shooting and wounding two U.S. military attaches at a strip club in the capital, the attorney general's office said on Friday.

Carlos Mejias, 32, admitted he shot the U.S. Embassy employees in the early hours of May 28, the office said.

It said Mejias got into an argument with them at the Antonella 2012 club, better known as "Angelus," in the city's upscale Chacao district.

"Later he pulled out a gun and repeatedly fired at the Americans, leaving them wounded at the location," it said in a statement.

Five days later, Mejias surrendered to authorities, it said, and was charged with attempted homicide. The U.S. Embassy in Caracas did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

One of the attaches was shot in the leg and the other in the stomach, police said. An embassy statement at the time said the injuries did not appear life-threatening.

Venezuela has one of the world's highest murder rates. Armed robberies and kidnappings are also common, and the U.S. Embassy this month tightened its security rules for travel in the capital by its employees.

Embassy employees must now request armored cars for travel after midnight in many of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods, including Chacao and its surrounding areas, which are home to several foreign embassies.

Diplomats from Mexico, Chile, Belarus and Costa Rica have all been abducted by criminals in Caracas in recent years - embarrassing the government, which has accused the opposition of exaggerating the crime problem to scare voters.

President Nicolas Maduro announced this year the latest campaign to crack down on violent crime. About 20 such efforts have been launched since his predecessor, the late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, took office in 1999.

President Barack Obama said on Friday the chemical weapons attack in Syria threatened U.S. allies Israel, Turkey and Jordan and that while "nobody ends up being more war weary than me" he is considering a narrow, limited U.S. response.

Obama, speaking to reporters at a meeting he held with Baltic leaders, said the United States must be prepared to act unilaterally if necessary to uphold what he called an international norm against the use of chemical weapons as part of U.S. obligations as a world leader.

As he spoke, the U.S. intelligence community released a report that said an August 21 chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb killed 1,429 people, including at least 426 children.

Obama, in the position of trying to persuade Americans weary of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to accept another U.S. involvement, insisted any military action he takes on Syria will be narrow and limited and not an open-ended, long-term commitment, nor would it involve U.S. troops on the ground.

"I assure you nobody ends up being more war weary than me, but what I also believe is that part of our obligations as a leader in the world is making sure that when you have a regime that is willing to use weapons that are prohibited by international norms on ... people, including children, that they are held to account," he said.

The United States and its allies have been unable to break through a deadlock in the U.N. Security Council given Russian and Chinese opposition to taking steps against the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad.

Given U.N. Security Council paralysis around the issue, he said, "a lot of people think something should be done but nobody wants to do it."

Obama said he had made no final determination on how to proceed but that he and his aides have been briefing congressional leaders and talking to foreign leaders about what is at stake.

He said U.S. allies Israel, Turkey and Jordan would be threatened, as well as U.S. national security interests, if Syria is allowed to use chemical weapons without retribution. Terrorists could get their hands on the weapons as well, he said.

International norms govern the control and use of such weapons, he said, but "if there is a sense that over time nobody is willing actually to enforce them, then people don't take them seriously."

Assad.

The comments from Erdogan, long one of Assad's fiercest critics, came as U.S. President Barack Obama said he was considering a narrow, limited U.S. response to last week's chemical weapons attack in Syria.

"It can't be a 24 hours hit-and-run," Erdogan told reporters at a reception in the presidential palace in the capital Ankara. "What matters is stopping the bloodshed in Syria and weakening the regime to the point where it gives up."

Erdogan cited the NATO operation against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo war as an example.

"If it is something like the example of Kosovo, the Syrian regime won't be able to continue," he said.

Erdogan said he would have bilateral discussions with Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin during the G-20 summit next week.

Earlier on Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said intelligence gathered by Ankara left no doubt that Assad's forces were responsible for the poison gas attack near Damascus last week.

Turkey has said previously it would be ready to take part in any international action against Assad, even outside the auspices of the United Nations, and has put its armed forces on alert to guard against threats from Syria.

service center, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

There were no initial reports of damage, and the West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami watch, warning or advisory in effect.

"At this point, we've seen no ocean-surface disturbance," said Bill Knight, a scientist at the tsunami warning center in Palmer, Alaska. While no tsunami was expected, he said scientists were still monitoring the area for any earthquake-induced waves.

The earthquake, which struck at 8:25 a.m. Alaska Daylight Time, was strongly felt in Adak, about 1,300 miles southwest of Anchorage, said City Manager Layton Lockett.

"It was kind of hard to miss," Lockett said. "The strangest thing about this one was its length in time. I think people actually had time to get out of bed to see what was going on."

A magnitude 7 earthquake is likely to produce shaking that lasts 20 to 30 seconds, although it could last longer depending on local tectonics, Knight said.

A public radio station in Unalaska/Dutch Harbor, KUCB, interviewed a woman in Adak who said she timed the temblor at 40 seconds. The earthquake was followed by about 10 aftershocks of magnitude 3.5 or higher, Knight said.

Most structures in Adak can withstand earthquakes and other forces of nature, and any damage would likely be limited to water pipes and similar facilities that have yet to be fully examined, Lockett said.

"Generally, the buildings are built really strong. We do live on a volcano," he said of the town, which state records indicate has 321 residents.

There are two volcanoes on Adak Island, along with remnants of a third volcano, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory.

The quake was also felt in Atka, a tiny Aleutian Island Native Aleut village 65 miles northeast of the quake's center, where Knight said callers reported "strong shaking" but no damage.



headline: Congo's army occupies rebel positions in breakthrough
byline: By Pete Jones
6:20pm EDT

In their biggest success in a year, government troops in Congo occupied strategic hills overlooking the eastern town of Goma on Friday after rebel fighters withdrew.

The M23 rebels, who have fought an 18-month uprising in the eastern borderlands of the Democratic Republic of Congo, said they quit the Kibati hills to allow an independent investigation into shelling that has killed civilians in Goma and the lakeside town of Gisenyi in neighboring Rwanda.

Rwanda has blamed Congo for the shelling and said it would not tolerate such "provocation", raising the risk that Congo's small but militarily powerful neighbor might openly intervene in a country where it has fought two wars in the last 20 years.

Regional diplomats said Rwandan forces were seen moving north from the capital. Local media published photos of troops in armored personnel carriers and trucks headed for the border.

Millions of people have died from violence, disease and hunger since the 1990s as foreign-backed rebel groups have fought for control of eastern Congo's rich deposits of gold, diamonds and tin, destabilizing Africa's Great Lakes region.

Congolese troops have been buoyed by the intervention of a new U.N. brigade fighting alongside them to drive back the M23 rebels. "We won!" they chanted in Kibati, until Thursday a rebel outpost on the frontline overlooking Goma. Two burned-out trucks were abandoned near the hilltop position.

"They did not leave by choice, they were confronted with the power of the army," Lieutenant Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman for Congo's armed forces, told reporters.

Rwanda has in the past justified intervening in Congo by saying it must hunt down Hutu extremists who took part in its 1994 genocide. But a complex web of local politics and regional conflicts over ethnicity, land and minerals are also at play.

Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo told Reuters: "If a diplomatic resolution means Rwanda standing by, arms crossed, waiting for its territory to be bombed and its people killed, then diplomacy is definitely off the table."

Although heavy fighting inside Congo has eased, there was sporadic firing on Friday. Congolese tanks fired on what they said were rebel positions in the bush. A Reuters journalist heard firing to the east, which Hamuli blamed on Rwanda's army.

CRITICAL POINT

Rwanda has been accused by U.N. experts of backing the rebels. Kigali denies the charge but world powers have stepped up pressure on Rwanda to stay out of Congo's conflict.

Hamuli said the rebels had retreated towards Kibumba, some 10 km (6 miles) north of Kibati. "We will go to Kibumba ... we are obliged to protect the population there," he said.

A regional diplomat, who is following the situation but asked not to be named, said the rebel force appeared to have remained largely intact despite the withdrawal.

"What happens next all depends on if the Congolese are prepared to go to the negotiating table and how hard Rwanda pushes at that point," the diplomat said.

"Anything could happen at this point, we are not relaxing yet. The next 24-48 hours will be critical."

The United Nations has thrown its weight behind Congo's government, saying its peacekeepers witnessed the M23 rebels firing shells into Rwanda.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who spoke to Rwandan President Paul Kagame on Thursday, condemned what his spokesman called indiscriminate shelling by the M23 that caused deaths among the civilian population, and urged parties to pursue a political process.

The M23 rebels, named after a March 23, 2009, peace deal that ended four years of rebellion in eastern Congo, took up arms last year saying the government had failed to honor the agreement, which included integrating them into the army.

After seizing Goma in November, the rebels further demanded Congo's President Joseph Kabila hold national talks, release political prisoners and disband the electoral commission.

Speaking on French radio RFI, M23 leader Bertrand Bisimwa called on Congo to resume stalled, Ugandan-hosted negotiations to end the conflict.

Congo's government spokesman, Lambert Mende, rejected any resumption of peace talks, saying the M23 must first disarm, demobilize and become a political party.

A Tanzanian peacekeeper was killed on Wednesday, the first death since the new U.N. brigade engaged rebels last week.

South Africa's military said on Friday it had received a request from the United Nations for three of its Rooivalk (Red Kestrel) attack helicopters to be sent to Congo.

right leader, who risks being ejected from parliament after a tax fraud conviction, off a list of new lifetime senators.

Napolitano had been pressed by members of Berlusconi's People of Liberty party (PDL) to grant their leader the honor bestowed on former heads of state and distinguished personalities in the arts and sciences.

But in a move that sends a clear political message to Berlusconi that he will receive no special treatment, Napolitano kept him off a list of four life senators named just a week before voting starts on whether to strip Berlusconi of his parliamentary seat under a law passed last year.

The appointees enjoy the full powers and privileges of being a lawmaker for life - including some legal immunity - meaning he could continue to wield influence after being found guilty and sentenced to four years of house arrest or public service that was commuted to one year.

The parliamentary committee begins its deliberations on September 9 but the decision has to be approved by a vote in the full chamber.

Berlusconi's allies have threatened to bring down the government they support along with Prime Minister Enrico Letta's center-left Democratic Party if the PD votes to oust him, as it has said it will.

"I'm very disappointed and profoundly sorry that the only one who should have been nominated a senator for life - Silvio Berlusconi - was not," Daniela Santanche, an adviser to the center-right leader, said in a statement.

"Without taking anything away from the four new life senators, I do not think they measure up to Berlusconi."

"ASBOLUTE INDEPENDENCE"

Friday's nominees were architect Renzo Piano, one of the creators of the futuristic Pompidou Centre in Paris and the Shard skyscraper in London, and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Carlo Rubbia.

Claudio Abbado, former director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, was another of the nominees along with a 50-year-old specialist in stem cell research, Elena Cattaneo.

There have been vacancies for the positions for some time after the deaths of some incumbents, making the timing of the unexpected appointments just ahead of the panel on Berlusconi even more significant.

Napolitano defended his choices in a statement sent immediately after the nominations were announced, saying all would make "highly significant" contributions "in absolute independence from political party influence".

Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud on August 1, throwing Italian politics into disarray.

In addition to the tax fraud case, Berlusconi is fighting a seven-year jail sentence for paying for sex with an under-aged prostitute and abusing his office to cover it up.

Seven-times Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who died earlier this year, was a life senator while on trial for colluding with the Sicilian Mafia. He was eventually acquitted, but his position helped shield him from arrest during the proceedings.

Just six years ago it was common for then-Prime Minister Romano Prodi to muster the votes of life senators to keep his government on its feet during delicate votes because of his narrow Senate majority.

"I would not like to see these nominations take on the importance of the life senators had for the Prodi government," said Roberto Calderoli, vice president of the Senate and a member of the Northern League.

Napolitano appointed former Prime Minister Mario Monti a life senator in 2011, boosting his political status and opening the way for Monti to form an emergency government to save Italy from a Greek-style default when a discredited Berlusconi resigned.

The nominations bring the total number of life senators to six alongside Monti and former President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.



headline: UK asked N.Y. Times to destroy Snowden material

The British government has asked the New York Times to destroy copies of documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden related to the operations of the U.S. spy agency and its British partner, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), people familiar with the matter said.

The British request, made to Times executive editor Jill Abramson by a senior official at the British Embassy in Washington D.C., was greeted by Abramson with silence, according to the sources. British officials indicated they intended to follow up on their request later with the Times, but never did, one of the sources said.

On Friday, in a public statement, Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, said his newspaper, which had faced threats of possible legal action from British authorities, on July 20 had destroyed copies of leaked documents which it had received from Snowden.

Rusbridger said that two days later, on July 22, the Guardian informed British authorities that materials related to GCHQ had made their way to the New York Times and the independent investigative journalism group ProPublica.

Rusbridger said in his statement that it then took British authorities "more than three weeks before anyone from the British government contacted the New York Times.

"We understand the British Embassy in Washington met with the New York Times in mid-August - over three weeks after the Guardian's material was destroyed in London. To date, no-one has contacted ProPublica, and there has been two weeks of further silence towards the New York Times from the government," Rusbridger said.

Rusbridger added that, "This five week period in which nothing has happened tells a different story from the alarmist claims made" by the British government in a witness statement it submitted on Friday to a London court hearing regarding an investigation by British authorities into whether the handling of Snowden's leaks violated British anti-terrorism and official secrets laws.

A spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington told Reuters: "We are not going to get into the specifics about our efforts but it should come as no surprise if we approach a person who is in possession of some or all of this material."

The spokesman added: "We have presented a witness statement to the court in Britain which explains why we are trying to secure copies of over 58,000 stolen intelligence documents - to protect public safety and our national security."

A spokeswoman for the New York Times said the paper had no comment.

The British investigation was opened after authorities at London's Heathrow Airport earlier this month used an anti-terrorism law to detain David Miranda, the domestic partner of Glenn Greenwald, a Guardian writer who has met with Snowden and has played a lead role in writing about material the former NSA contractor leaked.

Miranda was held and questioned for nine hours before being allowed to resume his trip from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro, where he and Greenwald live. Greenwald has said that Miranda had carried Snowden related material from him in Brazil to Laura Poitras in Berlin, an American film-maker who has also met with Snowden, and that Miranda was carrying Snowden-related materials which Poitras gave to him back to Greenwald.

In her witness statement submitted to the British court on Friday, Detective Superintendent Caroline Goode, who said she was in charge of Scotland Yard's Snowden-related investigation, said that among materials officials had seized from Miranda while detaining him was an "external hard drive" containing data encrypted by a system called "True Crypt," which Goode said "renders the material extremely difficult to access."

Goode said the hard drive contained around 60 gigabytes of data, "of which only 20 have been accessed to date." She said that she had been advised that the hard drive contains "approximately 58,000 UK documents which are highly classified in nature, to the highest level."

Goode said the process to decode the material was complex and that "so far only 75 documents have been reconstructed since the property was initially received."

Goode also said that it was "likely" that Scotland Yard "is investigating a conspiracy with a global dimension. It is necessary to ascertain if this stolen, classified material has been disseminated to others in order to prevent further disclosure which would prove valuable to terrorists, thereby preventing further offences and protecting public safety."

She also said that "Disclosure of any information contained within those documents would be gravely injurious to UK interests, would directly put lives at risk and would pose a risk to public safety and diminish the ability to counter terrorism."



headline: South Africa's waning gold industry braces for more strikes
byline: By Ed Stoddard
6:20pm EDT

South African gold miners plan to strike for higher pay from Tuesday, inflicting more damage on an industry that has produced a third of the bullion ever pulled from the earth but is now in rapid decline.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which represents almost two thirds of the country's 120,000 goldmine workers, served the mining firms notice of the strike starting from Tuesday's night shift, the companies said.

Negotiations broke down last week, with the unions and companies still poles apart over pay. The Chamber of Mines, which negotiates on behalf of the companies, said it made a final offer to increase basic wages by 6 to 6.5 percent.

The NUM is seeking 60 percent and rival union AMCU wants as much as 150 percent. The companies say those demands are unrealistic, given rising costs and falling bullion prices.

In a sign of the industry's frustration over the deepening crisis, Chamber of Mines president Mark Cutifani choked back tears on Thursday as he made an emotional appeal for an end to the violence and rounded on "thugs and murderers" he accused of stoking the unrest.

The unions seem determined to end what they see as a culture of low pay dating back to the apartheid era when impoverished black miners migrated to the industry's heartlands for jobs to feed their families back home.

White rule ended in 1994 and the unions say miners who risk their health toiling far below ground are due a bigger share of the spoils from a multi-billion-dollar industry.

But capital may have the edge over labor.

The companies have abundant cash and other resources, while most mine workers must feed several dependants and cannot go long without pay.

Wildcat strikes have shaken the industry since early last year, coupled with outbreaks of violence linked to a turf war between the NUM and the hardline Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU).

The mining crisis has triggered damaging credit rating downgrades for Africa's largest economy and criticism of President Jacob Zuma and the ruling African National Congress over their handling of the violence that left dozens dead.

This time around, the miners will down tools legally, offering some solace to nervous investors.

Zuma and the ANC are keen to keep a lid on the labor unrest and potential job losses ahead of elections in 2014.

"The employers will continue to make plans in anticipation of strike action, to ensure the continuation of essential services, and to ensure the safety and security of employees and assets," the mining companies said in a statement.

"The employers remain open to discussions with all unions and urge them to engage in good faith to reach an outcome that is acceptable to all," it said.

Affected companies include South Africa's main producers, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold, Sibanye, and some smaller operations.

SUNSET INDUSTRY

Wage talks have also broken down with AMCU and other unions, but they have not yet signaled an intention to strike.

A gold industry shutdown could cost South Africa more than $35 million a day in lost output, according to calculations based on the spot gold price and a Chamber of Mines estimate that the sector would stop producing about 760 kg a day.

This will put pressure on a struggling economy already weighed down by ongoing strikes in auto manufacturing, construction and aviation services, and facing potential strikes by textile workers and petrol station employees.

Since the start of 2011, Johannesburg's mining index has fallen 18 percent against a gain of 32 percent in the all-share index, which has scaled a series of record highs this year.

South Africa's gold industry, which once accounted for almost 80 percent of global bullion output, is in a state of steep decline and the country now produces just 6 percent of the world total.

It has been laid low by a combination of geological and economic setbacks. After more than a century of mining, the remaining ore lies deeper underground and is more costly and dangerous to extract. Labor and power costs per ounce of gold mined have leapt.

Market gold prices have not helped. Spot gold is now about 27 percent below its historic peak of over $1,920 an ounce scaled two years ago.



headline: Sri Lankans think U.N. is biased, president tells rights chief
byline: By Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal
6:20pm EDT

Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa told the United Nations human rights chief on Friday that his people believe the U.N. is a biased organization, and a report she is due to release next month has already prejudged the country.

Rajapaksa met U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay near the end of her week-long visit to Sri Lanka, where the government fought separatist Tamil guerrillas in a 26-year civil war before finally defeating them in 2009.

A U.N. panel has said it has "credible allegations" that both sides committed atrocities and war crimes, and singled out the government for most of the blame.

"President Rajapaksa told Pillay that the people of the country believe the United Nations is a biased organization," his office said in a statement. "They believe that your report has already prejudged (Sri Lanka)," it quoted him as saying.

Pillay, who has seen demonstrations for and against her mission, will give a news conference in Colombo on Saturday. She has met a wide range of people including fishermen, religious leaders, activists from non-government organizations, media, opposition members and ethnic minority Tamils in former war zones.

Her visit followed a second U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution in March this year that urged Sri Lanka to carry out credible investigations into killings and disappearances during the civil war, especially in the final stages.

Rajapaksa's comments came a day after a government minister accused Pillay of acting without transparency in evaluating the country four years after the end of its civil war and said her report would be unfair.

She will submit a summary report on Sri Lanka during a session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in September, and a more detailed report in March next year.

On Friday, a hundreds of people demonstrated near the U.N. head office in Colombo demanding Pillay look into all human rights violations in the nearly three-decade war, including disappearances of soldiers, instead of only examining the last few months of the conflict.

A U.N. panel has said tens of thousands of civilians were killed in the final months as government troops advanced on the rebels' last stronghold. Many hundreds of people, most of them Tamils, simply disappeared.

Sri Lanka has come under international pressure to bring to book those accused of war crimes and boost efforts to reconcile a polarized country. It has rejected the accusations of rights abuses, but Rajapaksa last month ordered an inquiry into mass disappearances.

headline: Colombian president orders military patrols in Bogota
byline: By Helen Murphy
6:20pm EDT

Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos sent troops to patrol the streets of Bogota on Friday after violent protests caused havoc across the capital, killing two people and leaving parts of the city in shambles.

Santos took the measure after almost two weeks of roadblocks, protests and clashes with police that spread from the countryside to cities, including Bogota, Medellin and Cali.

Police fired tear gas in downtown Bogota late on Thursday and a curfew was imposed in three densely populated areas of the capital overnight to control outbreaks of violence and looting.

"Yesterday I ordered the militarization of Bogota and I will do the same in any region or zone where the presence of soldiers is necessary," Santos said after an overnight cabinet meeting, adding that he was making ready as many as 50,000 troops.

"There is no protest, as fair as it may be, that justifies loss of life." the conservative Santos said. "We won't let these vandals get away with this ... Patience has run out."

Troops were posted on street corners in the south of the city on Friday morning, while close to the main square soldiers with rifles leant against walls daubed with political graffiti.

"We've been here since 4 a.m.," said one patrolman wearing camouflage fatigues. "There are rumors of an illegal protest in the afternoon; they could come from anywhere."

The protests began as a strike by farmers angry at agricultural and trade policies they say have left them impoverished, and then spread to other sectors. Bogota, a city of almost 8 million people, has not seen a large military presence for at least a decade, when drug traffickers sought to pressure the government with bomb attacks.

The protests are the fiercest challenge yet to Santos, who took office in 2010 vowing to cut poverty while continuing the free-market policies that have boosted foreign investment, especially in mining and oil.

How he handles the street turmoil may now play a big part in whether he seeks a second term next year.

Santos is already under pressure after taking a political gamble to open peace talks in Cuba with Marxist guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

Santos' government has said the rebels infiltrated the protests in an attempt to create disorder and put pressure on Santos at the negotiating table to get what they want.

While Colombians are desperate to see an end to five decades of conflict, many are losing patience after almost 10 months of difficult talks that have brought just partial agreement on one of five agenda points.

"He should have met the farmers from the first day, dialogue was necessary," said Pedro Pablo Pardo, a 38-year old security guard in Bogota who believes the FARC is behind the violence.

"Farmers don't smash business windows and hurl stones."

The FARC has increased its political sway in many rural areas since the peace talks kicked off in Havana in November, offering its backing to rural and labor movements.

Farm leaders on Friday rejected the violence and said they had reached partial agreement with the government which would allow them to lift roadblocks.

MASKED ACTIVISTS

Thousands of farmers and state workers marched through Bogota and other cities on Thursday, banging pots and pans as they converged after 11 days of blocking roads across the nation to prevent trucks reaching markets.

The protesters were mostly peaceful with many dressed in typical farmer attire of woolen ponchos and brimmed hats.

Then hundreds of masked activists rushed Bogota's main square and pelted shop and bank windows with rocks, smashed bus stops and clashed with riot police who fired tear gas to disperse them.

Santos had tried to ease tension earlier on Thursday, acknowledging that the agriculture sector had been "abandoned." But he called for peaceful dissent while talks about possible solutions continued.

The military will deliver food supplies by air and road to cities that are running low because of the roadblocks, Santos said. Food prices have shot up in some places due to shortages.

The demonstrations are the second wave of national strikes this year against agricultural and economic policies.

"This is getting totally out of control. This was purely rural and now it has shifted to an urban problem," said Alfredo Rangel, a security analyst. "I think we can expect to see more of this as it gets closer to elections."

Farmers complain that life has become harder in recent years because income from harvests has failed to cover costs of fertilizers and transportation.

Potato, corn and milk producers say free trade agreements with Europe and the United States have made it almost impossible to compete with cheaper imports.

A series of droughts followed by unusually heavy rains has also made farming conditions difficult in recent years.



headline: UK says Snowden leaks hurt its national security, could expose spies
byline: By Costas Pitas
3:59pm EDT

Leaks by a fugitive U.S. intelligence contractor have damaged Britain's national security, and the data he gave journalists includes information that might expose the identities of British spies, a government official told the High Court in London.

The official said Brazilian David Miranda, the partner of a Guardian newspaper journalist, was carrying a computer hard-drive containing 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents when he was detained at Heathrow airport earlier this month.

Miranda's partner Glenn Greenwald has led the Guardian's coverage of leaks from Edward Snowden, a former contractor at the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), about U.S. and British surveillance of phone and Internet users.

In a written statement to the court at Friday's hearing, Oliver Robbins, Britain's Deputy National Security Adviser for Intelligence, Security and Resilience, said media stories about the documents seized from Miranda had already caused harm.

"It is worth reiterating the point that real damage has in fact already been done to UK national security by media revelations," he said.

"A particular concern for HMG (the British government) is the possibility that the identity of a UK intelligence officer might be revealed. It is known that contained in the seized material is personal information that would allow staff to be identified, including those deployed overseas."

He also said that Miranda and others had shown "very poor judgment in their security arrangements" by making passwords to the material easily accessible.

Miranda's lawyer, Gwendolen Morgan, accused UK authorities of making "sweeping and vague assertions about national security."

"INACCURATE CLAIMS"

Snowden set off an international furor when he told newspapers in June that the NSA was mining the personal data of users of Google, Facebook, Skype and other U.S. companies under a secret program codenamed Prism. Facing espionage charges at home, he has taken temporary asylum in Russia.

Outrage among privacy campaigners and the media was fuelled when British authorities used anti-terrorism laws to detain Miranda for nine hours when he stopped off at Heathrow on August 18 on his way home to Brazil from a trip to ferry materials between Greenwald and a film maker in Berlin.

Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said Robbins had made "a number of unsubstantiated and inaccurate claims".

"The Guardian took every decision on what to publish very slowly and very carefully," he said, adding he was dismayed by the government's "blurring of terrorism and journalism."

Miranda, who returned to Brazil after being released by officers, had asked the London court to issue an injunction stopping police from examining the material.

But the court heard on Friday that lawyers representing him and the British authorities had agreed to give British police and the interior ministry until October - when a review will be held - to continue examining the seized data.

The decision prolongs a High Court ruling last Thursday that the data could be examined on counter-terrorism and national security grounds only, with further extension given on Friday under legislation designed to protect state secrets.

London's Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) welcomed Friday's court decision, saying in a statement that it needed to sift through the highly sensitive material to protect public safety.

Caroline Goode, a counter-terrorism detective, said in a witness statement released to the media that their investigations could stretch around the world.

"It is likely that the MPS is investigating a conspiracy with a global dimension. It is necessary to ascertain if the stolen, classified material has been disseminated."



headline: France says ready to act over Syria, despite British refusal

Assad's government, which it blamed for a chemical attack on civilians.

Hollande told the daily Le Monde he still supported taking firm punitive action over an attack he said had caused irreparable harm to the Syrian people, and said he would work closely with France's allies.

Diplomatic sources said that while the British decision could add to the French public's reservations about strikes, Hollande may now feel an even stronger duty to carry through on a promise to punish the perpetrators of the poison gas attack.

"The chemical massacre in Damascus cannot and must not go unpunished. Otherwise we'd run the risk of an escalation that would trivialize the use of these arms and put other countries at risk," Hollande told Le Monde.

Asked if France could take action without Britain, he replied: "Yes. Each country is sovereign to participate or not in an operation. That is valid for Britain as it is for France."

France, the former colonial power in Syria, has backed the opposition rebels since the start of the conflict yet is worried spiraling violence could spill over into Lebanon, where it has its strongest political and economic links in the region.

France has some 20,000 nationals living in Lebanon, myriad companies operating there and a peacekeeping force of around 800 soldiers. Diplomatic sources say Paris fears Assad's forces could attack its interests there in retaliation for strikes.

Unlike British Prime Minister David Cameron - who lost a parliamentary vote sanctioning military intervention on Thursday - Hollande could, if he chose, act before a French parliamentary debate set for Wednesday.

Hollande, who was due to talk on Friday to U.S. President Barack Obama, told Le Monde France had "a stack of evidence" that Assad's forces were behind last week's gas attacks. "I believe punitive action must be carried out against a regime that is doing irreparable harm to its people," he said.

France would act if the conditions justified it, he said, and any response would be firm and proportionate.

"There are few countries that have the capacity to inflict a sanction by the appropriate means. France is one of them. We are ready. We will decide our position in close liaison with our allies," Hollande said.

France most likely would deploy Rafale and Mirage fighter jets fitted with Scalp air-to-surface missile with a range of up to 250 km (155 miles), from Corsica in the Mediterranean.

PUBLIC LUKEWARM

France and Britain have become close diplomatic allies in the years since their disagreement over joining the 2003 U.S.-led war in Iraq and coordinate closely in defense operations.

Cameron stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Hollande's predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy two years ago when the EU members launched air strikes against the forces of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to stop his crushing of a rebel uprising.

French diplomatic sources said Paris had been braced for a refusal by British lawmakers to countenance British military action over Syria. While disappointing, it would likely make France more determined to join any U.S. action, they said.

"It wasn't a surprise that Cameron lost the vote but it has made Hollande's decision more complicated and more political. There are a lot of parameters to take into account," one senior source told Reuters. "It's not an easy decision."

He said France had not yet decided on its course of action but believed that not acting would create a dangerous precedent.

Francois Heisbourg, a special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research and former defense ministry adviser, said France was now waiting for the U.S. government to make public its own intelligence assessment about the chemical attack.

"The Americans will make their proof public this afternoon. It will prejudge what Obama will say and he will, either privately or publicly, let loose the dogs of war," he said.

Two opinion polls published this week, and carried out after the gas attack in Damascus, indicated lukewarm support among French voters for military intervention in Syria.

A survey by pollster CSA found 45 percent of respondents would support a U.N. military intervention and 40 percent would be opposed. Separately, 59 percent of people in an IFOP poll did not want France to take part in any intervention.

Hollande, whose popularity has been hurt by economic gloom, showed unexpected military mettle when he dispatched troops to help Mali's government fend off Islamist rebels earlier this year, an intervention backed by two-thirds of the public.

Almost two weeks after truck driver George Wala loaded building materials in the Kenyan port of Mombasa bound for a company in South Sudan he still hadn't reached his destination.

"I've been waiting for two days to clear my goods but no customs official has had time for me yet," the 30-year old Kenyan said, standing next to his truck in the muddy border post of Nimule, South Sudan's southern gateway to Uganda.

Every day up to 130 trucks from Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia or even farther away arrive at the customs clearing area the size of a football field in the small border town.

Once a sleepy outpost built by colonial ruler Britain to mark its southernmost presence in Sudan, Nimule has become an economic lifeline for South Sudan since the world's newest state seceded from Khartoum in 2011 following decades of civil war.

Landlocked South Sudan depends on its oil exports flowing north to fund its state budget, and remains vulnerable to shutdowns caused by disputes over pipeline fees and border conflicts with its former enemy Sudan.

With almost no industrial production and just some 300 km (190 miles) of paved roads, the new nation depends on truck drivers like Wala to provide it with everything from diesel to beer, condoms, trousers, laptops and frozen salami.

Whenever the road is blocked, supermarkets across the country struggle to get supplies - tomatoes were hard to find in the capital Juba this week after floods cut off the Nimule border crossing for days.

Cross-border traffic has, however, been on the rise since a U.S.-funded project converted the dirt track from the British era into South Sudan's only paved road.

The economic impact was immediate. "The new Nimule road has boosted trade and also lowered the transport cost of goods," said Kimo Adiebo, professor of economics at Juba University.

Annual inflation has fallen to less than 10 percent from over 40 percent since the road was completed last autumn.

From Juba 205 km (128 miles) north of Nimule, some goods continue their trip on bumpy roads to the rest of a nation the size of France. It takes up to a month for soft drink cans from Dubai, loaded in Mombasa, to reach the countryside.

The Nimule border officials say they handle customs formalities quickly but truckers waiting in the scorching heat tell a different story. As with other state institutions, South Sudan has struggled to build up an effective customs service.

"They don't have inspection sheds like at the Kenyan-Ugandan border," said Wala, drawing nods from other drivers. "Here you need to wait for a customs official to come to your vehicle."

And the border is open only from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. as the road from Nimule to Juba becomes dangerous at night with frequent accidents and bandits robbing passengers.

PASTA, TEA AND SUGAR FROM SUDAN

Still scarred from its long civil war, South Sudan has almost no significant food production apart from basic items such as milk, mineral water and beer - the latter thanks to a brewery built by SABMiller, one of the biggest foreign investments since independence.

The government has passed an investment act to encourage agricultural developments, but inefficient courts and non-existent land laws may deter even the most daring investors.

You can still get anything in Juba, a sprawling city of one-storey colonial era-houses, a few new modern office blocks and rows of container-type accommodation. Shops sell generators, television flat screens, baby milk and underwear from China.

Such goods arrive thanks to traders like Ashraf, who doesn't give his full name because part of what he does is not legal. Before he talks he beckons the reporter to the back of his computer shop, packed to the roof with the latest items.

He needs to buy dollars on the black market as the central bank struggles to provide them following a 16-month shutdown of South Sudan's oil output caused by the disputes with Sudan.

As important as dollars are connections. "If you don't know any customs officer they will charge you too much," he said.

To secure steady supplies and low duties he or a colleague travels to Kampala or Mombasa almost every month to stock up and ship the computers in a container truck, costing $8,500.

To make sure his goods arrive in time he clears the goods himself in Nimule. Even if he secures a low customs duty, laptops still cost $300 more than the same model in Uganda.

Until independence much of South Sudan's needs came from the north, with imports arriving in Port Sudan on the Red Sea and then travelling up the Nile. Since a 2005 peace pact ended the civil war, southern officials have sought to lower dependency on Khartoum by planning new roads to Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia.

Several road projects are in the works but for years Nimule will remain the only all-weather overland transport lifeline.

In the run-up to secession, Sudan closed the joint border in what South Sudan officials called an economic war. Both sides agreed in March to reopen it but this has not happened yet due to mutual mistrust.

Still, some products slip over to the South.

"The pasta comes from Sudan, the tea and the sugar," said Mohamed Adam, one of thousands of Sudanese working as food retailers in South Sudan. "The rest comes via Uganda and Kenya."

Despite the huge import bill, South Sudan's pound has stayed relatively stable. It lost 35 percent after the oil shutdown in early 2012 but has traded since on the black market at between 4 and 4.6 to the dollar versus an official rate of around 3.

In contrast, the Sudanese pound lost 75 percent on the black market due to the loss of pipeline fees from South Sudan

Diplomats attribute the South Sudan pound's resilience to an army of aid workers and U.N. officials in the country as well as foreign entrepreneurs such as builders or restaurant owners. With credit cards not working and bank transfers almost impossible expats bring in thousands of dollars daily through Juba airport.

byline: By Timothy Heritage
6:20pm EDT

Russia banned pork imports from Belarus on Friday, stepping up a diplomatic and trade war over the arrest of a Russian businessman and threatening to deepen the isolation of its former Soviet ally.

Russia is one of Belarus' few diplomatic backers after 19 years of authoritarian rule by President Alexander Lukashenko but has responded furiously to the arrest this week of Vladislav Baumgertner, head of Russian potash company Uralkali.

Baumgertner was seized on Monday at the airport outside the Belarussian capital Minsk after being invited to talks with the prime minister, and then humiliated by television footage showing him being searched in his prison cell.

Since then, Russian officials have announced a 25 percent drop in oil supplies to Belarus in September, threatened to extend the cuts for several months and hinted at possible restrictions on imports of Belarussian dairy products.

Russia's veterinary regulator said the restrictions on hog and pork product imports had been imposed over concerns about African swine fever in Belarus and would not be lifted until the virus was wiped out or brought under control.

The moves could deal a significant blow to Belarus, a transit country for Russian oil and natural gas to Europe. Its economy, already in danger of collapse, is heavily reliant on agriculture and Russian oil supplies.

"Relations between Russia and Belarus seem to be delving to new lows and the expectation is that Russia will further ratchet up pressure on its neighbor via the trade channel," said Timothy Ash, an analyst at Standard Bank in London.

"All this comes as the economy in Belarus looks precariously fragile."

POTASH CARTEL

The dispute followed the collapse this month of a Russia-Belarus sales cartel that controlled two-fifths of the $20-billion global market for potash, an ingredient used in mineral fertilizers.

In a sign that the breakup of the joint venture with Uralkali is causing problems for Belarus, a senior official at state potash producer Belaruskali said it had suspended two of its four potash mine complexes for maintenance.

Any big fall in output at Belaruskali, which was Uralkali's partner in the potash cartel, would have a severe impact on the finances of Belarus, where the soil nutrient accounts for 12 percent of state revenue and about 10 percent of export income.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said nothing in public about the dispute but his foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Moscow was counting on Belarus freeing Baumgertner quickly and described the dispute as commercial but not political.

The Kremlin also tried to play down the political impact by saying Putin had followed protocol by sending a telegram congratulating Lukashenko on his 59th birthday on Friday.

Russia has denied any of the economic or trade moves this week were connected with Baumgertner's arrest but the timing undermines these statements.

Belarus has defied the pressure, charging Baumgertner with abuse of his authority and threatening criminal charges against Suleiman Kerimov, Uralkali's top shareholder and a Kremlin ally.

But Belarus, a country of less than 10 million, needs Russia for energy and economic handouts and as a counterweight to the European Union and the United States, which shun him because of his treatment of opponents and lack of tolerance for dissent.

The timing is unfortunate for Putin because Russia is also in a dispute with Ukraine, another former Soviet republic which Moscow wants to dissuade from closer integration with the West.

Western European countries are following the situation closely because oil supply cuts in the past to Ukraine and Belarus have caused disruptions to pipeline flows to Europe.

Moscow says Kiev must choose between free trade with the EU and a Russia-led customs union that also includes Belarus, and wants control of Ukraine's gas pipeline network. But Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich stood firm on Friday, saying: We will not trade up our country - that is our principle."

Moscow is particularly sensitive to what happens in Belarus and Ukraine because it considers them as its "near abroad", an area where it sees Western diplomatic or economic interference as a threat.

Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich said on Friday he had no legal powers to allow jailed rival Yulia Tymoshenko to go abroad for medical treatment as some European governments have urged, but hinted compromise might be found if the law was changed.

The European Union says agreements on association and free trade with Ukraine could be in jeopardy if Yanukovich does not free former prime minister Tymoshenko, his fiercest opponent, who was jailed in 2011.

The EU says her trial for abuse of office was political.

With the signing of these agreements set for November, the Tymoshenko issue is coming to a head even as Russia, Ukraine's biggest single trading partner, piles pressure on Kiev to halt its drive towards Europe and join a Russia-led Customs Union.

In an attempt to end the deadlock over Tymoshenko, European envoys have sought to persuade Yanukovich to pardon her so she can go to Germany for treatment for chronic back trouble.

Replying to a question on Tymoshenko in a television interview on Friday, Yanukovich, however, said: "Unfortunately, in Ukraine, nobody has such authority, including the president ... Our laws do not allow for such circumstances".

Hinting at possible changes to legislation, he said: "The law would have to be changed so that someone would be provided with the authority to do this."

He said most political forces in parliament would "unite" to solve outstanding problems relating to European integration and he was optimistic that Kiev would meet criteria laid down by the EU for signing the agreements at a summit in Vilnius, Lithuania.

These so-called benchmarks for democratic progress relate to reforming the judiciary, ending politically motivated prosecutions and improving electoral legislation.

"Demands for the signing of association ... were put to Ukraine and we are working on them, putting the finishing touches, we might say. A final full-stop will be written this autumn. We will fulfill all the conditions. I have no doubt of this," he told 1+1 television channel.

But many diplomats say it is unlikely the agreements will be signed unless Yanukovich relaxes his stance on Tymoshenko.

Kiev has stuck to its aspiration of joining the European mainstream and turning away from its former Soviet master, but Yanukovich has not shown any inclination to free Tymoshenko.

She is his strongest political opponent and could doom his chances of re-election for a second term in 2015 if she became political active again.

KREMLIN FEARS

Even as the Kiev government seeks to persuade the EU that Ukraine is a fit partner for the future, it has come under pressure to back-track from Russia, which fears a flood of highly competitive goods on the Russian market if Ukraine joins an EU free trade zone.

Prime Minister Mykola Azarov on Wednesday urged Moscow to accept the "reality" of a changing world after Russia conducted extra customs checks on Ukrainian imports in a warning shot to Kiev and Russia's Vladimir Putin spoke of possible "protective" measures by Moscow and its Customs Union allies.

The pressure has led to talk of a trade war in Kiev and injected new tension into Moscow's relationship with Ukraine, which has pleaded unsuccessfully for a lower price for strategic supplies of Russian gas to bring relief to its economy.

Yanukovich on Friday avoided blaming Putin personally for the tension, but spoke of Kremlin "hawks" who were pushing a tough line with Ukraine over its pro-Europe course.

But he again brought up the issue of costly Russian gas deliveries, saying that Ukraine was paying $130-150 per thousand cubic meters more than any other country under a contract with Moscow that was "unjust".

Russia, which would like control of Ukraine's gas pipeline network, has used the promise of much cheaper gas to try to coax Kiev into the Customs Union.

But rejecting Russia's entreaties, Yanukovich said: "The proposals which have been made to us do not suit us. They are even humiliating for us. We are never going to go down that path. We will not trade up our country - that is our principle."

led government and secular opposition that could be decisive for the success of its experiment in democracy.

The small North African nation could still make this work, if its political class can rise above party rivalries to follow a road map to the rule of law laid out in 2011, analysts say.

Optimism has waxed and waned over the past week as the central figure of Tunisian politics, Islamist leader Rached Ghannouchi, offered to consider a deal for new elections that could produce an orderly transfer of power to the opposition.

The ensuing squabbling in his Ennahda party and in the opposition, which responded by demanding the Ennahda-led government's immediate resignation, dampened the initial hopes his offer had stirred. Then upbeat comments by main opposition leader Beji Caid Essebsi brightened prospects again.

"Tunisia risks a lot in this crisis but it is not going to collapse," said political analyst Jamel Arfoui. "It will continue its transition because Ghannouchi is trying to find solutions to avoid an Egyptian scenario."

A replay of the Egyptian army's bloody crushing of the once- dominant Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is hardly on the cards in Tunisia, where army coups are unknown and politics has rough edges but not the life-and-death polarization haunting Cairo.

Instead of taking an us-versus-them stand, the only independent force in Tunisia that can play a role anything like that of Egypt's army - the powerful UGTT trade union federation - has stepped in to mediate between Islamists and secularists.

"CANNY OPERATOR"

Crucially, Ghannouchi has read opposition protests as a sign it is time to compromise, not cling to power at all costs as Egypt's deposed Islamist President Mohamed Mursi tried to do.

"Ghannouchi is definitely a democrat," said Geoffrey Howard, North Africa analyst for the Control Risks consultancy group in London. "He's also a very canny operator."

Tunisia's latest crisis erupted in late July when Salafi Islamist militants assassinated a secular politician, the second such killing this year.

Accusing Ennahda of incompetence and laxity towards Islamist radicals, opposition parties called huge rallies to demand it immediately make way for a caretaker cabinet to hold new polls.

The head of the assembly writing a new constitution, which was elected in October 2011 with a one-year deadline that it missed, then suspended its work because of the unrest.

This meant Tunisia, whose current government was only meant to run affairs during a one-year transition, had strayed from the road map calling for a new constitution and then a caretaker cabinet to oversee voting for a fully democratic parliament.

The Egyptian army's ousting of Mursi on July 3 had already dealt a body blow to Islamist hopes of reshaping Muslim nations on more religious lines after decades of secular one-man rule.

These pressures seem to have prompted Ghannouchi, who during exile in Britain concluded that democracies offer religions more freedom than autocracies, to seek a consensus on new elections.

The problem now is to weather the transition. Ennahda has alienated many Tunisians by stressing its Islamist agenda while failing to tackle the country's economic and security problems.

It also aroused suspicion by placing its lieutenants in key administrative posts around the nation of 11 million, drawing charges that it could not be trusted to organize fair elections.

RUMBLINGS IN ENNAHDA

Over the past two weeks, Ghannouchi has accepted UGTT mediation for the transition and held an unprecedented meeting with opposition leader Essebsi, previously shunned by Ennahda as a relic of Tunisia's old order, to start discussing its details.

In one oft-mentioned scenario, work on the constitution would resume immediately and be finished by October 23, after which all-party talks would agree on a neutral caretaker cabinet to take over from Ennahda and quickly hold new elections.

But there are rumblings in Ennahda, especially among those who spent years in prison under former President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and who oppose compromise with Essebsi's Nida Tounes party because it represents many officials who served under him.

The emerging consensus has also sidelined Ennahda's two secular coalition partners, especially the Congress for the Republic (CPR) party whose trademark project - a law to ban those former Ben Ali officials from politics - has fallen victim to Ghannouchi's rapprochement with the opposition.

The leftist Popular Front is wary of Essebsi's cooperation with Ghannouchi because it wants his Nida Tounes party as an ally against Ennahda in the coming elections. It has called for more protests to pressure the government to resign now.

CLOSE BUT STILL FAR FROM GOAL

Wrangling over the constitution has been long and hard, with four months alone spent debating whether to mention sharia law in a special article, but the latest draft is almost finished without the controversial religious elements Ennahda wanted.

"The constitution is almost ready," said Amna Guellali, Tunisia researcher for Human Rights Watch. "If they have a political agreement, the rest can be done quite quickly."

But pre-election politics, with Ennahda casting its time in power in the best light and its foes jockeying for advantage, could throw up new hurdles to completing the transition.

Howard, the risk analyst, said he expected a technocratic government to emerge eventually, but predicted serious unrest if elections were delayed beyond the first quarter of 2014.

"The greatest danger is popular discontent," he said.



headline: South Africa's waning gold industry braces for more strikes
byline: By Ed Stoddard
6:20pm EDT

South African gold miners plan to strike for higher pay from Tuesday, inflicting more damage on an industry that has produced a third of the bullion ever pulled from the earth but is now in rapid decline.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which represents almost two thirds of the country's 120,000 goldmine workers, served the mining firms notice of the strike starting from Tuesday's night shift, the companies said.

Negotiations broke down last week, with the unions and companies still poles apart over pay. The Chamber of Mines, which negotiates on behalf of the companies, said it made a final offer to increase basic wages by 6 to 6.5 percent.

The NUM is seeking 60 percent and rival union AMCU wants as much as 150 percent. The companies say those demands are unrealistic, given rising costs and falling bullion prices.

In a sign of the industry's frustration over the deepening crisis, Chamber of Mines president Mark Cutifani choked back tears on Thursday as he made an emotional appeal for an end to the violence and rounded on "thugs and murderers" he accused of stoking the unrest.

The unions seem determined to end what they see as a culture of low pay dating back to the apartheid era when impoverished black miners migrated to the industry's heartlands for jobs to feed their families back home.

White rule ended in 1994 and the unions say miners who risk their health toiling far below ground are due a bigger share of the spoils from a multi-billion-dollar industry.

But capital may have the edge over labor.

The companies have abundant cash and other resources, while most mine workers must feed several dependants and cannot go long without pay.

Wildcat strikes have shaken the industry since early last year, coupled with outbreaks of violence linked to a turf war between the NUM and the hardline Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU).

The mining crisis has triggered damaging credit rating downgrades for Africa's largest economy and criticism of President Jacob Zuma and the ruling African National Congress over their handling of the violence that left dozens dead.

This time around, the miners will down tools legally, offering some solace to nervous investors.

Zuma and the ANC are keen to keep a lid on the labor unrest and potential job losses ahead of elections in 2014.

"The employers will continue to make plans in anticipation of strike action, to ensure the continuation of essential services, and to ensure the safety and security of employees and assets," the mining companies said in a statement.

"The employers remain open to discussions with all unions and urge them to engage in good faith to reach an outcome that is acceptable to all," it said.

Affected companies include South Africa's main producers, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold, Sibanye, and some smaller operations.

SUNSET INDUSTRY

Wage talks have also broken down with AMCU and other unions, but they have not yet signaled an intention to strike.

A gold industry shutdown could cost South Africa more than $35 million a day in lost output, according to calculations based on the spot gold price and a Chamber of Mines estimate that the sector would stop producing about 760 kg a day.

This will put pressure on a struggling economy already weighed down by ongoing strikes in auto manufacturing, construction and aviation services, and facing potential strikes by textile workers and petrol station employees.

Since the start of 2011, Johannesburg's mining index has fallen 18 percent against a gain of 32 percent in the all-share index, which has scaled a series of record highs this year.

South Africa's gold industry, which once accounted for almost 80 percent of global bullion output, is in a state of steep decline and the country now produces just 6 percent of the world total.

It has been laid low by a combination of geological and economic setbacks. After more than a century of mining, the remaining ore lies deeper underground and is more costly and dangerous to extract. Labor and power costs per ounce of gold mined have leapt.

Market gold prices have not helped. Spot gold is now about 27 percent below its historic peak of over $1,920 an ounce scaled two years ago.

South Africa's gold producers said on Friday the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) had served notice of a strike over pay demands starting from the night shift on Tuesday.

"The employers will continue to make plans in anticipation of strike action, to ensure the continuation of essential services, and to ensure the safety and security of employees and assets," the producers said in a statement.

"The employers remain open to discussions with all unions, and urge them to engage in good faith to reach an outcome that is acceptable to all," it said.

Affected companies include South Africa's four main gold producers, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold, Sibanye, and some smaller operations.

Wage talks between the NUM, which represents about 64 percent of the over 120,000 workers in gold mining, and the companies broke down last week.

The country's Chamber of Mines, which negotiates on behalf of gold producers, said on Tuesday it had made a final offer to unions to increase basic wages by between 6 and 6.5 percent.

NUM has been seeking a 60 percent increase while a more hardline rival wants pay hikes of up to 150 percent. The companies say these demands are unrealistic, given rising costs and falling bullion prices.

A complete shutdown of the gold sector of indeterminate duration could cost South Africa more than $35 million a day in lost output, according to calculations based on the spot price.

This will put pressure on a struggling economy already weighed down by a ongoing strikes in auto manufacturing, construction and aviation services, and facing potential strikes from textile workers and petrol station employees.



headline: Rival of Merkel takes pacifist stance on Syria before TV duel

war sentiment ahead of their only TV duel in the campaign.

After two days of telephone diplomacy by Merkel, who faces a tricky balancing act between backing Germany's allies while heeding German voters' opposition to an attack, Steinbrueck tried to differentiate himself in typically blunt style.

"I want to make it quite clear for myself and for the SPD (Social Democrats) that we believe a military intervention would be wrong because we cannot see how it would help the people in Syria," the center-left politician told reporters.

Steinbrueck, 66, is struggling to make a dent in the conservative chancellor's popularity ahead of the September 22 election, when she will be seeking a third term.

He may hope to boost his chances by heeding pacifist strains in German society, especially on the left, as SPD chancellor Gerhard Schroeder did in his 2002 campaign by staunchly opposing the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

The SPD wants to help the international community "break out of this military logic", said Steinbrueck, proposing that the U.S. and Russian presidents and the heads of the United Nations and Arab League focus instead on negotiating a ceasefire.

Merkel has said that Syrian President Bashar-al Assad's government, embroiled in civil war with rebels, should not go unpunished over what the United States said was its use of internationally banned chemical weapons on August 21, an attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb.

But she has not explicitly come out publicly in favor of military action, for which Washington is preparing. Assad has denied resorting to poison gas, blaming rebels for the attack.

Asked on Friday about Merkel's telephone conversations on Syria with Obama and other leaders, her spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference there had been no request for German involvement in any military strike against Damascus.

Steinbrueck and Merkel will be mindful, in their live TV debate on Sunday, of the public mood in Germany when it comes to a possible military strike against Damascus.

Polls show overwhelming distaste for any military action - and especially for any German participation - meaning Berlin may have to stand aside, as it did on Libya two years ago.

Many Germans are instinctively averse to foreign military involvement given the nation's Nazi past, when it started World War Two and perpetrated the Holocaust.

establishing permanent military bases despite plans to boost the U.S. presence in its former colony.

Hagel was in Manila as the two allies opened a new round of talks to allow U.S. forces to store equipment and supplies and to deploy, on a temporary basis, ships, planes and troops at several locations to offset China's assertiveness in the region.

Washington has similar arrangements with Australia and Singapore, part of the Obama administration's "rebalancing" policy in Asia, shifting combat forces from Afghanistan and Iraq to the Asia-Pacific region as China flexes its military muscle.

But with U.S. forces evicted in the early 1990s from permanent bases in the Philippines, Hagel sought to avoid offending sensitivities on any new stationing of troops.

"The United States does not seek permanent bases in the Philippines that would represent a return to an outdated Cold War mentality," Hagel told a news conference after talks with President Benigno Aquino.

"Instead, we're using a new model of military to military cooperation befitting two great allies and friends. I'm looking to increase our rotational presence here as we have done recently in Singapore and Australia."

The left-wing opposition urged the president to reject any stationing of forces in the country.

"The Philippine government must reject the U.S. plans to use Philippine facilities as de facto bases," said Renato Reyes, Secretary General of the Bayan (Nation) movement.

"The U.S. can and will use the Philippines as a staging ground for military intervention in other parts of the world, dragging us into conflicts not of our choosing and against our interest."

Friction between China and the Philippines, and other countries in the region, over disputed territories in South China Sea has increased since last year despite diplomatic efforts to forge an agreement on maritime conduct.

Hagel said earlier the United States would continue to seek out an international coalition to act together on Syria after Britain's parliament rejected military action.

6:20pm EDT

Prime Minister David Cameron's plans to join a potential military strike on Syria were thwarted on Thursday night when Britain's parliament narrowly voted against a government motion to authorize such action in principle.

In a humiliating defeat for the British leader likely to damage Cameron's hopes of being re-elected in 2015 and set back traditionally strong U.S.-UK relations, parliament defied Cameron by 285 to 272 votes.

Commentators said it was the first time a British prime minister had lost a vote on war since 1782, when parliament effectively conceded American independence by voting against further fighting to crush the colony's rebellion.

Speaking immediately after the vote, Cameron told lawmakers he would not seek to go against parliament's will.

"It is very clear tonight that while the House has not passed a motion, it is clear to me that the British parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action - I get that and the government will act accordingly," he said.

British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond later said he thought the United States, a key ally, would be disappointed that the UK "will not be involved.

He added: "I don't expect that the lack of British participation will stop any action." But, he told BBC TV, "It's certainly going to place some strain on the special relationship," referring to ties with Washington.

U.S. officials suggested President Barack Obama might be willing to proceed with limited action against Syria even without allied support, but that no final decision had been reached.

Veto-holding members of the United Nations have held inconclusive debates on a draft Security Council resolution that would authorize "all necessary force" in response to the alleged gas attack by Syria's government.

Cameron's defeat calls into question Britain's traditional role as the United States' most reliable military ally, a role that Cameron worked hard to cement.

"There will be a national soul-searching about our role in the world and whether Britain wants to play a big part in upholding the international system," finance minister George Osborne, one of Cameron's closest allies, told the BBC.

When asked whether the parliamentary defeat would damage Britain's alliance with the United States, Osborne said: "There's a bit of hyperbole on this in the last twenty four hours. The relationship with the United States is a very old one, very deep and operates on many layers."

GREAT BRITAIN?

Cameron's defeat also underscores how bitter the legacy of Britain's involvement in the 2003 Iraq war remains a decade later.

On that occasion, Britain, under the leadership of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, helped the United States invade Iraq after asserting - wrongly, it later turned out - that President Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.

Already embroiled in Afghanistan, Britain was then sucked into a second quagmire in Iraq, losing 179 soldiers in eight years after the 2003 U.S.-British invasion that toppled Saddam.

Speaking during an at times impassioned debate on Thursday that preceded the vote, Cameron acknowledged that painful legacy.

"I am deeply mindful of the lessons of previous conflicts, and in particular the deep concerns in the country caused by what went wrong with the Iraq conflict in 2003," he said.

"One thing is indisputable: The well of public opinion was well and truly poisoned by the Iraq episode and we need to understand the public skepticism."

Cameron previously implored the world not to stand idly by over Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons but ran into trouble from skeptical lawmakers within his own party and from the opposition Labour party who demanded to see more evidence before voting in favor of military action.

Although some commentators hailed his defeat as proof that British parliamentary democracy was alive and well, others said he had put his credibility on the line and lost.

Earlier on Thursday, Cameron's government published legal advice it said showed it was legally entitled to take military action against Syria even if the United Nations Security Council did not approve such action.

It also published intelligence material on the August 21 chemical weapons attack in Syria's civil war, saying there was no doubt that it had occurred and that it was "highly likely" Syrian government forces were responsible. The nerve gas attack killed hundreds of civilians in an embattled suburb of Damascus.

The defeat was all the more galling for Cameron since he had cut his summer holiday short, recalled parliament for an emergency debate and held an extraordinary meeting of Britain's National Security Council as well as making numerous calls to Obama and other allies.

POISONOUS IRAQ LEGACY

Obama has set out the case for a limited military strike on Syria, but some U.S. lawmakers say they have not been properly consulted.

Speaking after the vote, the White House said Obama would decide on a response to chemical weapons use in Syria based on U.S. interests, but that Washington would continue to consult with Britain.

UK opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband, a man critics often impugn as being a lightweight political foe to the more statesman-like Cameron, played a big role in the prime minister's defeat.

He had unexpectedly announced on Wednesday night that he wanted important amendments to the government motion before he could back it.

Addressing parliament, Miliband struggled to find his composure but advised lawmakers not to rush to judgment "on a political timetable set elsewhere," a thinly disguised reference to the United States.

Domestically, Cameron's authority looks dented. Part of his problem is that he governs as part of a two-party coalition because his Conservatives lack an absolute majority in parliament, exposing him to such impromptu revolts.

Cameron's critics are already circling. Their main allegations: He is not a conviction politician and fails to prepare the ground properly for his policies.

But public opinion was never on his side.

A YouGov poll published on Thursday showed that 51 percent of the British public opposed a missile strike, with just 22 percent in favor of it.

headline: Japan seeks biggest defense budget rise in 22 years
byline: By Kiyoshi Takenaka
6:20pm EDT

Japan's Defense Ministry said on Friday it was seeking a three percent increase in next year's budget allocation, the biggest rise in 22 years, with most of the growth linked to revised personnel costs and equipment imports made more expensive by a weaker yen.

The budget request for the year from April 2014 comes as Japan remains locked in a territorial spat with China over uninhabited East China Sea islets, fraying ties between Asia's two biggest economies and raising security concerns.

Saddled with hefty public debt, Japan had been cutting its defense spending in recent years. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who returned to power last December for a rare second term pledging to stand tough in the islands row, increased this year's defense budget for the first time in 11 years.

The ministry said it planned to request 4.82 trillion yen ($48.97 billion) in budget appropriations, up 3.0 percent from the current year.

Following the earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan's northeast in March 2011, government workers' salaries were cut by 7.8 percent on average to help finance reconstruction.

That temporary measure is set to expire next March, boosting the Defense Ministry's personnel costs by about 100 billion yen for the next fiscal year.

The ministry's spending plans for the next fiscal year include research on unmanned high-altitude surveillance planes and tilt-rotor aircraft, with actual purchases tentatively planned for the following year.

BETTER DEFENCE FOR REMOTE ISLANDS

Japan hopes that tilt-rotor aircraft such as the Osprey and drones including Northrop Grumman Corp's Global Hawk will help it better defend remote islands.

The Osprey, built by Boeing Co and Textron Inc's Bell Helicopter unit, can fly as quickly as a plane but lands like a helicopter.

"In order to respond effectively to attacks on islands, it is indispensable to securely maintain superiority in the air as well as on the sea," a ministry release on the budget request said.

Since Japan purchased three of the disputed islets, called the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, from a private Japanese owner last September, patrol ships from both countries have been shadowing each other near the islands.

That has raised fears that an unintended collision could lead to a broader clash.

Japan also faces potential threats from North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The Defense Ministry plans to set aside 1.7 billion yen next year to prepare for the stationing of Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile interceptors at its Tokyo headquarters.

In another move to strengthen its defenses, the ministry aims to set up a force of Marines as soon as possible and plans to earmark 1.5 billion yen next year to introduce training facilities to improve its members' amphibious capabilities.

Japan's Coast Guard, whose ships are playing cat-and-mouse with Chinese vessels around the disputed islets, is requesting a 13 percent increase in funding to 196.3 billion yen for the next fiscal year as it builds new patrol ships and piers.

The Coast Guard aims to boost the size of its staff by 528 people, which would be the largest personnel expansion in decades. It also plans to order 10 patrol vessels.



headline: Afghanistan suicide attack kills Kunduz district governor, civilians
byline: By Folad Hamdard
6:20pm EDT

A suicide attack in Afghanistan's northern Kunduz province killed a district governor, one of his bodyguards and 10 civilians at a memorial service at a mosque on Friday, government officials said.

It was the latest in a string of attacks this week across Afghanistan, where insurgents are seeking to destabilize the government ahead of the withdrawal of most international troops by the end of 2014.

The group in Kunduz was attending a ceremony for a tribal elder who had died the day before, the officials said. The district governor, Sheikh Sadruddin, had been in his position since 2002 and been active in the fight against the Taliban.

"Officials ... were attending prayers in a mosque when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives," said Enayatullah Khaliq, a spokesman for the Kunduz governor.

Twenty people were also wounded in the morning blast, police said.

Government officials and aid groups working with government ministries and Afghan security forces have been targeted in reprisal killings this week in provinces previously regarded as relatively stable.

Six men who worked for a development program were executed in western Herat, one of Afghanistan's more stable provinces with a prosperous private sector that is helping to drive the national economy.

The toll on security forces this week has also been high. An ambush in western Farah killed 15 policemen and another four were killed in Ghazni in the east in a Taliban attack on an international military base. Several soldiers were also killed in Helmand, a Taliban stronghold in the south.

Civilians however continue to bear the brunt of the war, with about 20 killed in attacks during the week, and more than 50 wounded in the Ghazni attack alone.

fly" list won a partial victory in federal court when a judge found they "have a constitutionally protected liberty interest" in traveling internationally by air.

But U.S. District Judge Anna Brown has yet to decide whether the government violated their constitutional rights to due process under a policy that excludes individuals from commercial air travel if they are suspected of having ties to terrorism.

In her ruling late on Wednesday in Portland, the judge also asked both the plaintiffs and the Department of Justice for more information before deciding key parts of the case.

The 13 plaintiffs, all U.S. citizens who deny any links to terrorism, say they were placed on the government's no-fly list without notice or any realistic avenue of appeal.

They complain they only learned of their no-fly status after buying airline tickets, arriving at airports and being refused permission to board a plane. The government has refused to officially acknowledge that they are on its list.

The only recourse an individual has for clearing one's name, they argue, is an essentially dead-end process by which they fill out a form and receive back a letter with no explanation or even a confirmation of their no-fly status.

The government counters that there is an adequate means of contesting the flight ban, and that individuals listed under the policy may ultimately petition a U.S. appeals court directly for relief.

The Justice Department has also argued that barring one's access to air travel is not an undue burden or a violation of a constitutionally protected right.

Brown disagreed, disputing the government's "contention that international air travel is a mere convenience, in light of the realities of our modern world."

ADEQUATE AVENUE OF APPEAL

But the judge said she was not ready to decide on a proper remedy in the case, suggesting the answer hinged on whether the plaintiffs had an adequate avenue of appeal.

"The court is not yet able to resolve on the current record whether the judicial-review process is a sufficient, post-deprivation process under the ... Constitution," she wrote.

She gave both sides until September 9 to recommend a process "to better develop the record" so she can complete her ruling.

During a hearing in June, Brown questioned if the government's procedure of directly appealing a no-fly status to an appellate court was feasible. Appellate judges are limited to reviewing a record established through lower-court proceedings.

Moreover, no-fly case files the government keeps contain classified information that is off-limits to examination by the travelers in question or their lawyers.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the lawsuit in 2010, applauded the ruling, while a Justice Department attorney who argued the government's case in court declined to comment.

"For the first time, a federal court has recognized that when the government bans Americans from flying and smears them as suspected terrorists, it deprives them of constitutionally protected liberties, and they must have a fair process to clear their names," ACLU attorney Nusrat Choudhury said in a statement.

The no-fly list, established in 2003 in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, bars those on it from flying within the United States or to and from the country. It is shared with foreign governments.

As of last year, the list included some 20,000 people deemed by the FBI as having, or reasonably suspected of having, ties to terrorism, an agency spokesman said at the time. About 500 of them were U.S. citizens.

Among the 13 plaintiffs challenging the policy are four U.S. military veterans, one a former member of the Air Force who has been separated from his wife since 2010 while she was stuck in Ireland with visa troubles.

Another plaintiff, Aalah Ali Ahmed, says he could not travel to Yemen when his brother died and has been unable to visit his extended family or manage property he owns in Yemen.



headline: Rwanda accuses Congo of shelling as tensions mount
byline: By Jenny Clover and Pete Jones
6:20pm EDT

Rwanda accused Congo on Thursday of shelling its territory and said it would not tolerate such "provocation", raising fears that violence in eastern Congo could erupt into a regional conflict.

The Democratic Republic of Congo said Rwanda's accusation was a sign Kigali wanted to intervene openly in its eastern war. Rwanda has denied accusations by U.N. experts that it covertly backs Congo's M23 rebels.

The mounting cross-border tensions came as a newly-deployed U.N. Intervention Brigade, with an unprecedented mandate to crush rebel groups, entered combat alongside the Congolese army for the first time. U.N. officials accused the M23 of firing a shell into Rwanda on Thursday which killed a civilian.

Congo and Rwanda have fought two wars over the last two decades in Congo's mineral-rich, lawless east. Rwanda has come under intense international pressure to play a constructive role for peace in its larger neighbor after rebels seized control of Goma, the largest city in eastern Congo, in November.

Regional mediators said they were "gravely concerned" by the escalation in violence and called for a return to peace talks. M23 rebels said they were ready for a bilateral ceasefire but this was promptly rejected by Kinshasa.

Rwanda said a woman was killed and a baby seriously injured by a shell that fell in its territory on Thursday.

"We have the capacity to determine who fired at us and will not hesitate to defend our territory. Rwanda has a responsibility to protect its population," Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo said in a statement.

Mushikiwabo did not say what action might be taken. She said a total of 34 rounds had been fired into Rwanda in the last month by Congolese forces: "We have remained restrained for as long as we can but this provocation can no longer be tolerated."

Kinshasa said the statement was part of a plan to justify Rwandan intervention in Congo's eastern Kivu provinces, a decade after Kigali officially withdrew troops from a previous war.

"All (Rwanda) wants to do is find a way to create permanent disorder to allow them to enter and loot the Kivus, as they have done over the last 15 years," Congolese Information Minister Lambert Mende told Reuters.

Ray Virgilio Torres, the top civilian official in the U.N. peacekeeping mission in North Kivu province, said U.N. troops had confirmed that the shell that killed the woman in Rwanda was fired by rebels in the frontline town of Kibati.

"It is something we condemn in the strongest terms, they are war crimes and something that for us remains unacceptable."

A rebel spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

MILITARY SOLUTION

Goma, the capital of North Kivu, has been at the heart of two decades of conflict stretching back to the Rwandan genocide. Since then, Kigali has repeatedly intervened in Congo, saying it had to hunt down Hutu militia who fled into Congo's lawless east after taking part in the 1994 mass killings.

The M23 is the latest incarnation of eastern Congo's Tutsi-led rebellions exploiting Kinshasa's weak grip on its borderlands, where there is a complex web of local politics and regional conflicts over ethnicity, land and minerals.

Reuters reporters in Goma heard blasts of heavy weapons from the frontline around Kibati, 11 km (7 miles) to the north. A U.N. military spokesman confirmed U.N. attack helicopters had carried out air strikes but gave no further details.

A brief rebel seizure of Goma last November embarrassed the U.N. and prompted the creation of the 3,000-strong brigade with a mandate to neutralize armed groups, including the M23.

A Tanzanian peacekeeper was killed in Wednesday's fighting, the first death since the brigade engaged rebels last week after accusing the insurgents of shelling the lakeside town of a million people.

A diplomat in the Great Lakes region said Rwanda had provided support to rebels to counter the subsequent U.N. aerial and ground assault. Rwanda blocked U.N. sanctions against two M23 leaders on Wednesday.

Regional countries, acting under an umbrella organization called ICGLR, called on Thursday for a resumption of stalled peace talks. The U.N. Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region Mary Robinson has also said for a political solution.

Global intelligence firm Stratfor said the involvement of the U.N. brigade had made a negotiated solution less likely.

"(Congo's) president will continue to push for a military solution to the crisis in North Kivu and appeal for additional support from the U.N. forces in the country," Stratfor added.



headline: Colombian president calls for calm as farm protests reach Bogota

5:56pm EDT

Thousands of Colombian farmers and state workers marched through Bogota on Thursday, banging pots and pans as they converged on the capital after 11 days of increasingly violent protests against agricultural and trade policies they say have left them impoverished.

Students wearing balaclavas pelted shop windows with rocks near the capital's main square and clashed with riot police who fired tear gas to disperse them. Bogota imposed a curfew in three of the more populated areas of the city after violence continued into the night.

"Long live the farmers' strike! Food sovereignty," protesters chanted as they waved anti-government banners.

President Juan Manuel Santos, who has been unable to end the so-called national strike that has united potato growers, milk producers and teachers, acknowledged agriculture is in crisis, but called for peaceful dissent while talks about possible solutions are going on.

"The farm sector has been abandoned," the center-right president said in a televised address early on Thursday. "The protests are valid ... but, via dialogue, we will resolve the problems ... We are in a storm, but we will persevere."

Protesters wearing typical farmer attire of woolen ponchos, brimmed hats and rubber boots to show their solidarity, marched in 15 columns toward the Plaza Bolivar, where the presidential palace and Congress are located. There were also protests in Medellin, Cali and elsewhere across the nation.

Farmers have blocked roads, snarling city-bound traffic and piling pressure on Santos three months before he must decide whether to run for a second term. The government's tough peace negotiations with Marxist FARC rebels are creating their own contentious national debate at the same time.

"My purchase power is zero, it's only enough to survive," said Orlando Pamo, 50, an indigenous father of six from central Tolima province who earns less than the minimum wage farming citrus and other fruits. "The government wants us off the land so it can be given to big business. We don't get the benefits companies get."

Santos said he will lift import duties on 23 products, including some fertilizers and pesticides, to help lower crop production costs. He also is working to find more permanent solutions for the farm sector's problems.

Clashes between police and protesters over removal of the barricades resulted in at least one death and scores of injuries and arrests since the strike began on August 19.

Looting was reported in several towns and blocked roads have prevented food getting to market, raising prices for consumers. Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon has accused the FARC rebels of infiltrating the protests and seeking to rope peaceful farmers into their struggle against the government.

"Please, let's not fall into the hands of the violent," said Santos. "Do not allow them to gain strength from these protests because it will distort the entire meaning of the demonstration and it leads to unnecessary confrontations that have led to deaths."

SECOND WAVE

The already grueling life of farming families has become harder in recent years since income from harvests has failed to cover costs of fertilizers and transportation.

Potato, corn and milk producers complain that free trade agreements with Europe and the United States have made it almost impossible to compete with cheaper imports. Droughts followed by unusually heavy rains have also made farming conditions difficult over the past several years.

The demonstrations are the second wave of national strikes this year against agricultural and economic policies.

"More demonstrations will follow in the coming days if there is no response from the government," said Julio Roberto Gomez, head of the nation's second biggest union confederation, as protesters banged pots and pans behind him.

Even though Santos has made improving the conditions of the poor and cutting the jobless rate a priority, difficulties for farmers are unlikely to change in the coming months.

Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said it would be impossible to meet all demands from the different protest groups.

"The country is on the right track and the economy is an example worldwide," he said on local radio. "But if you add up everything they want, there's no way to give them it all. They are seeking significant resources. There isn't enough money to cover the demands of all the sectors."

headline: Australia investigates elite troops over Taliban corpse mutilation
byline: By Rob Taylor
6:20pm EDT

Australia's military is investigating a unit of special forces soldiers accused of mutilating the corpses of one or more insurgents killed during operations in Afghanistan, Australian state television reported on Friday.

The incident, in which the hands were allegedly cut from the body of at least one of four militants killed, took place during an operation involving Afghan forces and elite Australian soldiers in the southeastern province of Zabul on April 28.

The hands were taken back to the main Australian base at Tirin Kot, in nearby Uruzgan province, for identification and fingerprinting, the ABC said.

An investigator from the Australian military had previously lectured a group of special forces soldiers and told them it did not matter how fingerprints were taken, and that they could cut off the hands of the dead for fingerprinting, the ABC said.

Australia's military declined to confirm details of the incident, but said in a statement sent to Reuters that an investigation was underway into "an incident of potential misconduct" involving special forces soldiers.

"Following the mission, an incident of potential misconduct was raised through the Australian Defense Force's internal command chain," the military said statement said. "The ADF takes any potential occurrence of misconduct by Australian personnel very seriously."

The mutilation of insurgent corpses by members of the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan has previously triggered complaints and unrest and in the conflict-racked nation, although often news of incidents takes days to trigger protests.

British troops were investigated in 2011 over accusations a soldier cut the fingers from a dead insurgent and kept them as trophies, while U.S. paratroops belonging to the Army's 82nd Airborne Division were in 2012 accused of posing for photos with the dismembered bodies of insurgent bombers.

Also in 2012, a U.S. Marine staff sergeant was pleaded guilty to urinating on the bodies of dead insurgents and posing for pictures during operations in Helmand Province in July 2011.

Australia's military, which is in the process of withdrawing about 1,550 troops from Afghanistan, said it had informed the Afghan government of the incident, along with senior commanders of the NATO-led force. The investigation was going on and it was "inappropriate" to comment further, it said.

Australia's soldiers, the ABC said, were required to collect fingerprints and eye scans of dead Taliban fighters. But the mutilation of bodies violates internationally agrees rules of war under the Geneva Convention.

Islamic custom also requires that bodies be buried intact.

Australian special forces in Afghanistan include both elite Special Air Services soldiers and separate commando units. The military did not say which force was under investigation.

Australian troops operated under strict rules of engagement "while ensuring that the actions of Australian forces are consistent with our obligations under Australian and international law", the military said.

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, campaigning for elections on September 7, said he would allow the investigation to run its course and that he had full confidence in the military.

Australia, a close U.S. ally, aims to have the bulk of its troops out of Afghanistan by the end of this year, ahead of a deadline for the withdrawal of most Western combat troops by the end of next year.



headline: U.S. consults oil experts as it weighs action against Syria
byline: By Timothy Gardner and Roberta Rampton
6:20pm EDT

Obama administration officials have contacted energy experts in recent days to discuss oil market conditions as the president weighs a military strike against Syria, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

There are no signs the government is preparing to tap emergency oil reserves soon in a bid to tame rising prices, according to the sources who spoke with Reuters this week, though the administration is closely monitoring the situation.

Fears about Syria's civil war spilling over into other countries have helped propel international oil prices to their highest level in six months, rising more than $8 a barrel since the beginning of the month, and approaching a level that has slowed the global economy in the past.

That has spurred early market chatter about whether Obama might tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, a 700 million barrel resource last used in 2011 after months of supply disruptions during the Arab Spring.

"I don't think a use of the SPR is either imminent or being strongly considered at this time," said one source who had spoken with administration officials as part of regular discussions with them about oil markets.

"It probably wouldn't be unless the blowback from any strikes on Syria is more severe than anticipated," the source said.

Oil analysts have said a quick strike against Syria could push prices up to $125 to $130 a barrel, with Societe Generale saying prices could reach $150 a barrel if the crisis were to spill over into larger oil producing countries.

Energy markets are already nervous because of major supply disruptions in Libya, where armed groups and labor strikes have caused crude exports to be cut to their lowest level since the 2011 civil war.

A UK official also said a strategic oil release, which would be coordinated by the International Energy Agency (IEA), was not on the radar in London, despite elevated oil prices.

The Paris-based IEA, with which the Obama administration coordinated on a sale of 60 million barrels of U.S. and European reserves in 2011, said on Thursday the rise in oil prices this month does not call for a response, but that the agency stands ready to respond, "in the event of a major supply disruption.

NOT IMMUNE FROM SPIKES

President Barack Obama has made it clear that he plans to hold the Syrian government responsible for a chemical weapons attack last week that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb. A missile strike is among the options being considered by the Obama administration.

"I have no interest in any open-ended conflict in Syria, but we do have to make sure that when countries break international norms on weapons like chemical weapons that could threaten us, that they are held accountable," Obama told PBS Newshour in an interview on Wednesday.

Even though the United States is in the midst of its biggest oil drilling boom in decades, with production at the highest level since 1997, prices would still likely spike if there was a major supply disruption in the Middle East.

The North Sea Brent crude benchmark that helps set the majority of world oil prices traded around $114 per barrel on Thursday, near the $120 level that analysts say could push the White House to begin considering using the SPR.

An administration official, speaking on background, declined to comment specifically on how closely it was watching oil prices.

"We are continuously monitoring the global oil supply and demand situation," the official said.

READY TO RESPOND

Syria has not exported any oil since late 2011, when international sanctions came into force. Prior to the sanctions Syria produced 370,000 barrels per day (bpd), roughly 0.4 percent of global supplies, and exported less than 150,000 bpd, mainly to Europe.

But there are concerns that a U.S. strike could cause the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran and has been involved in fighting in Syria, to carry out retaliatory attacks in Turkey, Jordan, or oil-producing Iraq.

One of the sources who has spoken with U.S. officials said there is a concern that Iran, which has supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, may walk away from talks on its disputed nuclear program.

The unpredictability of what action the United States will take, and what happens afterwards, has helped push markets higher, said Charles Ebinger, head of the energy security initiative at the Brookings Institution.

Ebinger said he had not heard anyone in Washington talking seriously about tapping strategic reserves, but he said that could change quickly if a price jump of $15 to $20 a barrel threatened to stall the economic recovery.

"I'm sure if the market got too jittery, we'd try to do it," he said.

exporting country.

Mahama narrowly clinched December's vote with 50.7 percent of the ballot but the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) had alleged fraud ranging from inflated tallies to the participation of unregistered voters.

Justice William Atuguba, president of the nine-member panel, told a packed courthouse in downtown Accra that the tribunal had dismissed the opposition appeal - a ruling broadcast live to the transfixed West African nation.

"The overall effect is that the first respondent (Mahama) was validly elected," Atuguba said.

Supporters of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) broke into song when the ruling was announced. Opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo expressed disappointment but said his party would abide by the court ruling.

"Our reaction to this judgment will be watched keenly in Africa and beyond and will set a precedent for generations to follow," he told reporters. "It is now up to all Ghanaians to put the disputes behind us and come together."

Many in Ghana hope the court's detailed ruling - broadcast live across the nation of 25 million people - will set a precedent on a continent where election challenges are often swept under the carpet.

Legal experts had expected the court to dismiss the opposition case, saying it had failed to conclusively prove a level of fraud that would have changed the election result.

BOLD ECONOMIC MEASURES

The ruling should settle the political scene in the country that has built a reputation for political stability in turbulent West Africa.

"Let peace rein. This is a victory for Ghana's democracy," Mahama said via his Twitter feed.

Mahama said later in a broadcast speech that he believed the court ruling would remove uncertainty over his mandate and give him the opportunity to take the bold measures to tackle challenges Ghana's economy was facing.

"There are various reforms that must take place, bold decisions that must be made," he said in the televised speech to the nation. "I assure you that I am prepared and committed to take those decisions and to ensure that those reforms are implemented."

The cocoa-, gold- and oil-exporting nation has outlined plans to trim a budget deficit which climbed to more than 12 percent of GDP last year, from a target of 6.7 percent. Its local cedi currency has fallen around 11 percent against the U.S. dollar since January.

Most shops in central Accra were shuttered and the streets quiet as many Ghanaians watched the verdict at home. Police had sealed off main streets leading to the court, where helicopters hovered overhead, part of a deployment of 30,000 officers nationwide in case of any violence.

Ghana's $39 billion economy has been powering ahead, growing 8 percent last year, after oil production began at Tullow's Jubilee field in 2010.

"We expect this confidence to calm the foreign exchange market," said economist Joe Abbey of Accra-based CEPA.

However, some analysts said investors' attention would now shift back to the government's efforts to trim a budget deficit which climbed to more than 12 percent of GDP last year.

"Although an important element of uncertainty has been removed with the court verdict, it is unlikely that we will see a significant market impact," said Razia Khan, Africa analyst at Standard Chartered bank. "Investors will pay careful attention to any measures aimed at achieving fiscal consolidation."



headline: Pakistan prison escapee evolves into al Qaeda-backed jailbreak artist
byline: By Katharine Houreld
6:20pm EDT

The young Pakistani militant pounds a boxing bag, removes a pistol from its holster and fires in slow motion across gently sunlit fields.

"After eight years in a death cell, he came out - by the grace of Allah - and now he is back on the battlefield," intones the YouTube video voiceover.

Adnan Rasheed, the long-haired, laughing star of the video, escaped that death cell and went on to set up an Islamist group specializing in jailbreaks, masterminding a raid that freed 250 prisoners, including Taliban militants.

Little was known about the group, Ansar al-Aseer, before the July 30 raid on the jail in the northwestern Pakistani town of Dera Ismail Khan. A well-funded alliance of fighters armed with explosives and rocket-propelled grenades carried out the attack with military-like precision.

Drone strikes have killed many senior militants, but the jailbreak shows how Pakistan faces an uphill struggle in tackling a Taliban insurgency even as the Taliban step up attacks in neighboring Afghanistan. Most NATO troops there are due to leave next year.

Militants from the Pakistani and Afghan Taliban, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, banned Sunni sectarian group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and al Qaeda all co-operated in the jailbreak, security officials and militants said.

Several similar groups have broken up after short periods and the durability of Ansar al-Aseer is not yet clear. But the story of 33-year-old Rasheed, jailed for trying to assassinate former President Pervez Musharraf, illustrates how low-ranking foot-soldiers can evolve into prominent militant commanders.

AN OFFICER NICKNAMED "TALIBAN"

As a young air force officer, Rasheed dreamed of studying in Germany, he told the militant magazine Azan.

But after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States he decided to join the Afghan Taliban. His desertion earned him the nickname "Taliban" and 14 days in military jail.

Later he tried to become a suicide bomber but returned to the air force, discouraged, when his militant group split, he told the magazine. He only returned because he hoped to fight neighboring India, he said.

In 2003, Rasheed and three other members of the air force tried to blow up Musharraf, angered by his alliance with the United States.

The men were jailed, but last year Rasheed escaped with nearly 400 other inmates when militants attacked that prison. Since then, he has appeared in two videos with Ansar al-Aseer, dedicated to freeing militant prisoners.

"My beloved brothers behind bars ... I didn't forget you," he said in Urdu in a video released in January, sitting cross-legged under a tree with two bearded men who later in the clip speak in Russian and German. "The first purpose of this group is to make your release possible by all means."

In the second video, called "Death Squad for Musharraf", Rasheed threatens to send the former president, himself charged with the 2007 murder of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, "to hell" and his small group of masked fighters perform push ups, leapfrogs and marksmanship exercises.

Last month, Rasheed wrote a letter justifying the Taliban's attempted killing of schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai, a campaigner for girls' education in Pakistan. Malala was shot by Taliban gunmen in October as she left school in northwestern Pakistan.

So far, Rasheed's group is relatively unknown. The Taliban already have well-established sub-units, including the Tora Shpa or "Black Night," which raises cash through bank robberies and kidnappings, and the Khorasan, who torture and kill those suspected of directing drone strikes.

AL QAEDA BACKING

Ansar al-Aseer was mainly funded by the Taliban and helped by al Qaeda trainers, two Taliban militants said. Three of the al Qaeda trainers - a Saudi Arabian, a Kuwaiti and a Yemeni - were killed in a drone strike in South Waziristan last month, one of the militants said.

jails where our mujahideen brothers are present," a senior Taliban commander told Reuters. "Financially it is supported by a number of groups ... al Qaeda provides support and weapons training to the new recruits."

But militant sub-groups frequently disband or change names to confuse security services or as loyalties shift, said Saifullah Mahsud of the FATA Research Center, which tracks militant activity in Pakistan's tribal areas.

The jailbreak was the first time many militants had heard of Ansar al-Aseer, he said.

The attack on Dera Ismail Khan underscored the militants' ability to infiltrate the security forces. A handful of fighters went to town three months beforehand to cultivate police and prison contacts, a security official said.

One such sympathizer opened the prison's main gate for the militants, he said.

The jailbreak itself had been meticulously planned. Some fighters donned police uniforms. Others disguised as a military convoy roared down from the Taliban stronghold of North Waziristan. Plainclothes fighters cut power to the jail and set up nine roadblocks to ambush reinforcements. Radio messages tricked soldiers into preparing for an attack on the barracks.

The tactics were so successful that the attackers did not use the seven suicide bombers they had on standby, the security official said.

After the attack, authorities said they would beef up security around high-profile detainees. But few think that will deter future raids.

"The state is not waking up," the security official said. "We are going to see more of these attacks."



headline: Congo's M23 rebels shelled Rwandan territory, U.N. says
byline: By Michelle Nichols and Louis Charbonneau
6:20pm EDT

U.N. peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo have witnessed shelling into Rwanda by M23 rebels over the past week and have not observed any firing across the border by the Congolese army, the United Nations said on Thursday.

Rwanda accused its Central African neighbor earlier on Thursday of persistently shelling into its territory and said such "provocation" could no longer be tolerated, after a flare-up of fighting in Congo's war-torn east.

Deputy U.N. peacekeeping chief Edmond Mulet briefed the U.N. Security Council on the situation and said the U.N. mission in Congo - known as MONUSCO - has seen only M23 rebels shelling into Rwanda, according to Deputy French Ambassador Alexis Lamek.

"Mr Mulet explained that actually the only acts of shelling witnessed by MONUSCO towards the Rwandan territory ... do come from M23," Lamek told reporters after the briefing.

Rwanda's deputy U.N. ambassador, Olivier Nduhungirehe, was adamant that the shelling had been carried out by Congolese troops and questioned how the U.N. peacekeepers could have concluded so quickly that M23 rebels were to blame.

"We are sure that the bombs are coming from the FARDC," he told reporters, referring to the Congolese army, but he added that Rwanda was calling for an independent investigation to "convince the international community."

U.N. experts and Congo have accused Rwanda of supporting M23, a claim Kigali rejects. The cross-border accusations underscore the M23 rebellion's roots in a web of local politics and regional conflicts over ethnicity, land and minerals.

It was not immediately clear what motive M23 would have for firing into Rwanda.

U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said U.N. peacekeepers had not seen the Congolese army firing into Rwanda during the past week.

The U.N. Security Council condemned the resumption of fighting in eastern Congo in a statement on Thursday and also "expressed concern at reports of repeated mortar shells and bombs from DRC territory landing in Rwandan territory."

It called for a "thorough investigation into the sources of these shells and bombs by the Expanded Joint Verification Mechanism," a regional body created to investigate incidents between the two countries.

The statement was agreed after several days of diplomatic wrangling during which Rwanda repeatedly blocked proposed language and pushed for it to specify, among other things, that shells landing in its territory had come from Congo.

BAN SPEAKS WITH KAGAME

Mulet told the council on Thursday that there were consistent reports of external support for M23 and that peacekeepers had gathered credible reports of Rwandan troops crossing into Congo, said a council diplomat present at the briefing, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Mulet said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had spoken with Rwandan President Paul Kagame to urge restraint, the diplomat said.

Rwanda accused the Congolese army of firing a shell that killed a woman and seriously wounded her two-month-old baby in a market in Rubavu town on Thursday morning, followed by a second shortly after that wounded another person.

The U.N. special envoy to Congo, Martin Kobler, and the commander of MONUSCO are visiting Rwanda "to clarify matters as they continue to urge all sides for maximum restraint" over the cross-border shelling incidents, Haq said.

One U.N. peacekeeper from Tanzania was killed and three other blue-helmeted troops were wounded during fighting in eastern Congo on Wednesday.

Rwanda blocked a joint U.S.-French proposal to impose U.N. sanctions on two senior M23 commanders, arguing that the evidence against the men was weak, Rwandan and other U.N. envoys said on Wednesday.

Nduhungirehe, the Rwandan deputy ambassador, told Reuters that Kigali blocked the proposed blacklisting because it would have undermined regional efforts to bring peace to eastern Congo and Kampala talks between M23 and Congo's government.

A 3,000-strong U.N. intervention brigade, with a tough new mandate to protect civilians and neutralize armed groups in Congo, sprang into action last week after it accused the M23 rebels of shelling the eastern city of Goma.



headline: Israel said planning to deport African migrants to Uganda
byline: By Allyn Fisher-Ilan
6:20pm EDT

Israel plans to soon begin deporting migrants from Eritrea and Sudan, who number more than 50,000, back to the African continent via Uganda, officials said.

Israel regards most of these Africans as illegal visitors crowding impoverished areas in search of jobs, and largely rejects the position of human rights groups that many fled their countries in search of political asylum.

A statement late on Thursday from Interior Minister Gideon Sa'ar said Israel would soon begin a staged process of deporting the migrants, most of whom crossed the border with neighboring Egypt - Israel's frontier with Africa - since 2006.

Sa'ar said an agreement had been reached with an African country other than Eritrea and Sudan to absorb these migrants who would soon be urged "to leave of their own free will."

Michal Rozin, chairwoman of parliament's committee on foreign workers, said by telephone that Uganda was the country that had agreed to absorb migrants who had settled in Israel.

Rozin, of the left-wing Meretz party that opposes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, said there were "rumors" that Uganda may have agreed to the arrangement in exchange for a deal for money and weapons.

There was no immediate comment from officials in Kampala.

Without mentioning any country by name, the Haaretz newspaper said the nation where African migrants from Israel would be absorbed had recently concluded deals to be supplied with artillery guns and mortars, and to improve an aging fleet of combat aircraft.

"The government has made the agreement but the attorney general has now approved it so that it may be implemented," Rozin told Reuters by telephone.

She urged the government to expose more details of the plan, including whether there were assurances that the migrants would not be forcibly repatriated to Sudan or Eritrea, saying that in these countries "we know many would be at risk of their lives."

Human rights groups say Israel has jailed hundreds of African migrants and has taken other steps as a pressure tactic to get them to agree to leave the country.

A few thousand are believed to have left Israel in the past year since a law enacted in 2012 authorizing migrants who lack any official residence permits to be jailed for up to three years, said Sigal Rozen, policy coordinator for Hotline for Migrant Workers (HMW), an Israeli human rights group.

In July, a group of 14 Eritreans were repatriated after receiving $1,500 each from Israeli authorities, in what HMW denounced at the time as a "grave human rights violation," citing Eritrea's poor human rights record as a cause for concern.

At least one group of Africans was flown out of Israel to South Sudan in the past year and other migrants have been offered cash to leave voluntarily. Some 2,000 Africans are being held in the southern detention centers.

A fortified fence along Israel's tense border with Egypt's Sinai has largely stemmed the flow of migrants who walked across what was once a pororous frontier at a rate of up to 2,000 a month in 2011.

Assad, after the opposition party made clear it would not support an imminent military strike against Syria.

In a move that deepened a widening split that threatens to complicate Cameron's efforts to secure bipartisan backing for military action, the defence secretary and Cameron's head of communications leveled the charge at Labour leader Ed Miliband.

"I am disappointed with Ed Miliband's behaviour frankly," British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told Channel 4 TV news.

"Anything that stops us from giving a clear, united view of the British parliament tonight will give some succour to the (Assad) regime."

Hammond was speaking as Britain's parliament debated how Britain should respond to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria as lawmakers from across the political spectrum aired deep unease about the prospect of military strikes.

Earlier on Thursday, Craig Oliver, Cameron's head of communications, had complained to reporters that "a lot of the arguments over this could give succour to the (Syrian) regime".

Labour complained to Britain's top civil servant Jeremy Heywood over what it said were "infantile" and "irresponsible" comments, demanding an apology and asking for the comments to be withdrawn.

"It is particularly disappointing given the serious nature of today's debate and the fact that throughout the country people will be listening with great concern about events in Syria, some knowing their relatives could soon be involved in military action," senior Labour MP Michael Dugher wrote in a letter to Heywood.

Cameron was forced to change tack on Wednesday evening and extend his timetable for military action against Syria after Miliband threatened to sabotage a parliamentary vote on the subject.

In a breach of etiquette that exposed unusual rancour within Britain's political elite, an unnamed person in Cameron's office used a string of strong expletives on Wednesday night to describe to the Times newspaper what the government thought of Miliband, which the paper duly published on Thursday.

6:20pm EDT

The five permanent U.N. Security Council members met again on Thursday to discuss an alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria last week as Western powers consider possible military action against the Syrian government, U.N. diplomats said.

The meeting lasted for just under an hour. U.S., British, French, Chinese and Russian diplomats declined to comment to reporters after the meeting. One diplomat said it was not clear why Russia had called for the meeting and nothing new was raised.

"There's no further P5 (permanent council members) meeting scheduled but that could change," a diplomat told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Russian diplomats declined to comment on the meeting apart from the fact that it had ended.

Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States held an inconclusive meeting on Wednesday on a draft Security Council resolution that would authorize "all necessary force" in response to the alleged gas attack.

The five permanent members have veto powers on the Security Council. Russia, Syria's main arms supplier, as well as China, have already vetoed three resolutions condemning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and threatening it with U.N. sanctions.

Russia has made clear it opposes any military action in Syria and suggested the rebels may have launched last week's attack that killed hundreds of people in suburbs east of Damascus. Syria has also blamed the rebels and urged Ban to investigate reports of rebel gas attacks.

nation Security Council. Diplomats told Reuters that it was not clear if a resolution would be put to a vote in the council given that Russia would almost certainly veto anything authorizing the use of force against Syria.

The U.N. meeting came as President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron sought to convince cautious lawmakers and the public of the need to strike Syria, though U.S. officials conceded they lacked conclusive evidence that Assad ordered his forces to use chemical weapons against civilians.

The United Nations has received at least 14 reports of possible chemical weapons use in Syria. After months of diplomatic wrangling, a team of experts, led by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom, arrived in Syria on August 18.

The U.N. team was initially going to look into three incidents, but its priority became investigating an alleged gas attack in the rebel-held suburbs of Damascus last week, which activists say killed hundreds of civilians.

"The team was able to do some preliminary work about the three sites it was initially looking into but it has not been able to conduct onsite visits ... basically because this new priority rose up while they were in country," U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters.

"The Secretary-General does expect to have some form of an oral briefing from the investigators once they are out of the country," Haq said. "The investigators as currently scheduled expect to wrap up their work by Saturday morning."

He said Ban was returning to New York on Thursday after cutting short a trip to Europe.

Germany and France have called for an immediate briefing for the Security Council on the investigation team's results as soon as they become available. They also called for an international reaction to last week's alleged gas attack in Syria.

headline: Colombian president calls for calm as farm protests reach Bogota

Thousands of Colombian farmers and state workers marched through Bogota on Thursday, banging pots and pans as they converged on the capital after 11 days of increasingly violent protests against agricultural and trade policies they say have left them impoverished.

Students wearing balaclavas pelted shop windows with rocks near the capital's main square and clashed with riot police who fired tear gas to disperse them.

"Long live the farmers' strike! Food sovereignty," they chanted, holding up protest banners.

President Juan Manuel Santos, who has been unable to end the so-called national strike that has united potato growers, milk producers, teachers and health workers, acknowledged agriculture is in crisis, but called for peaceful dissent while talks about possible solutions are going on.

"The farm sector has been abandoned," the center-right president said in a televised address early on Thursday. "The protests are valid ... but, via dialogue, we will resolve the problems ... We are in a storm, but we will persevere."

Protesters wearing typical farmer attire of woolen ponchos, brimmed hats and rubber boots to show their solidarity, marched in 15 columns toward the Plaza Bolivar, where the presidential palace and Congress are located.

Farmers have blocked roads, snarling city-bound traffic and pressuring Santos three months before he must decide whether to run for a second term. The government's tough peace negotiations with Marxist FARC rebels are creating their own contentious national debate at the same time.

"My purchase power is zero, it's only enough to survive," said Orlando Pamo, 50, an indigenous father of six from central Tolima province who earns less than the minimum wage farming citrus and other fruits. "The government wants us off the land so it can be given to big business. We don't get the benefits companies get."

Santos said he will lift import duties on 23 products, including some fertilizers and pesticides, to help lower crop production costs. He also is working to find more permanent solutions for the farm sector's problems.

Clashes between police and protesters over removal of the barricades resulted in at least one death and scores of injuries and arrests since the strike began on August 19.

Looting was reported in several towns and blocked roads have prevented food getting to market, raising prices for consumers. Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon has accused the FARC rebels of infiltrating the protests and seeking to rope peaceful farmers into their struggle against the government.

"Please, let's not fall into the hands of the violent," said Santos. "Do not allow them to gain strength from these protests because it will distort the entire meaning of the demonstration and it leads to unnecessary confrontations that have led to deaths."

SECOND WAVE

The already grueling life of farming families has become harder in recent years since income from harvests has failed to cover costs of fertilizers and transportation.

Potato, corn and milk producers complain that free trade agreements with Europe and the United States have made it almost impossible to compete with cheaper imports. Droughts followed by unusually heavy rains have also made farming conditions difficult over the past several years.

The demonstrations are the second wave of national strikes this year against agricultural and economic policies.

"More demonstrations will follow in the coming days if there is no response from the government," said Julio Roberto Gomez, head of the nation's second biggest union confederation, as protesters banged pots and pans behind him.

Even though Santos has made improving the conditions of the poor and cutting the jobless rate a priority, difficulties for farmers are unlikely to change in the coming months.

Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said it would be impossible to meet all demands from the different protest groups.

"The country is on the right track and the economy is an example worldwide," he said on local radio. "But if you add up everything they want, there's no way to give them it all. They are seeking significant resources. There isn't enough money to cover the demands of all the sectors."



headline: Obama makes case for Syria strike, British house votes no

Assad for what Western governments believe was his use of chemical weapons against civilians.

U.S. officials conceded on Thursday they lacked conclusive evidence that Assad personally ordered last week's poison gas attack, and some allies have warned that military action without U.N. Security Council authorization risks making the situation worse.

President Barack Obama's top national security officials were due to brief Congress on Syria later on Thursday, but any intervention looked set to be delayed at least until U.N. investigators report back after leaving Syria on Saturday.

The British parliament's rejection of the largely symbolic motion proposed by Prime Minister David Cameron, which would have given authorization in principle for action subject to a second vote, was a setback for Obama's efforts to build a coalition for action.

Cameron said afterward he would not override the will of parliament and approve such action, saying it was clear that parliament did not want to see a military strike on Syria to punish it for chemical weapons use and that he would act accordingly.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest suggested before the British vote that the United States might be willing to act on its own.

"When the president reaches a determination about the appropriate response ... and a legal justification is required to substantiate or to back up that decision, we'll produce one on our own," Earnest said.

Syrian opposition sources said Assad's forces had removed several Scud missiles and dozens of launchers from a base north of Damascus, possibly to protect them from a Western attack, and Russia was reported to be moving ships into the region.

But expectations of imminent turmoil eased as the diplomatic process was seen playing out into next week, and the White House emphasized that any action would be "very discrete and limited," and in no way comparable to the Iraq war.

The United States and its allies have "no smoking gun" proving Assad personally ordered the attack on a rebel-held Damascus neighborhood in which hundreds of people were killed, U.S. national security officials said.

In secret intelligence assessments and a still-unreleased report summarizing U.S. intelligence on the alleged gas attack on August 21, U.S. agencies expressed high confidence that Syrian government forces carried out the attack, and that Assad's government therefore bears responsibility, U.S. national security officials said.

Syria denies blame for the gas attacks and says they were perpetrated by rebels. Washington and its allies say the denial is not credible.

Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel were among senior U.S. officials expected to brief congressional leaders later on Thursday. Some lawmakers complained they had not been properly consulted.

While U.N. chemical weapons inspectors spent a third day combing the rebel-held area where the attack took place, traffic moved normally elsewhere in Damascus, with some extra army presence but little indication of any high alert.

An extended parliamentary debate in London revealed deep misgivings stemming from the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After pressure from lawmakers, the British government - a key player in any proposed air assault on Syria - had promised parliament that even if it voted in favor, there would be a second decisive vote once the U.N. weapons inspectors report their findings.

Even that motion was defeated by 285 to 272 votes.

'MONSTROUS CRIME'

The United Nations said its team of inspectors would leave Syria on Saturday and report to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

France and Germany urged the world body to pass its report on to the decision-making Security Council as soon as possible "so that it can fulfill its responsibility with regards to this monstrous crime."

The United States, Britain and France say they can act with or without a U.N. Security Council resolution, which would likely be vetoed by Russia, a close ally of Assad. But some countries are more cautious: Italy said it would not join any military operation without Security Council authorization.

Western diplomats say they are seeking a vote in the 15-member Council to isolate Moscow and demonstrate that other countries are behind air strikes.

A report from Moscow that Russia is sending two warships to the eastern Mediterranean underscored the complications surrounding even a limited military strike, although Russia has said it will not be drawn into military conflict.

The ambassadors of the five veto-wielding permanent U.N. Security Council members appeared to have made no progress at a meeting on Thursday, a council diplomat said. The five - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - had held an inconclusive meeting on Wednesday to discuss a draft Security Council resolution that would authorize "all necessary force" in response to the alleged gas attack.

Cameron told Britain's parliament it would be "unthinkable" to proceed if there was overwhelming opposition in the Security Council. But he published legal advice given to the government under which military action would be lawful for humanitarian reasons even if a Security Council resolution were blocked by a veto.

The International Committee of the Red Cross joined a chorus of international voices urging caution.

"Further escalation will likely trigger more displacement and add to humanitarian needs, which are already immense," said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC delegation in Syria.

Increasing expectations that any action will be delayed ended a three-day selloff on world share markets on Thursday, although investors were still on edge over fears of future turmoil in the Middle East.

'SHOT ACROSS THE BOW'

Obama sought to win over a war-weary American public on Wednesday evening by saying intervention in Syria, where more than 100,000 people have been killed in 2 1/2 years of civil war, would serve U.S. national security interests.

"If we are saying in a clear and decisive but very limited way, we send a shot across the bow saying, 'Stop doing this,' this can have a positive impact on our national security over the long term," he told "PBS Newshour" in a televised interview.

According to the U.S. national security officials, evidence that forces loyal to Assad were responsible goes beyond the circumstantial to include electronic intercepts and some tentative scientific samples from the site.

"This was not a rogue operation," one U.S. official said.

Western leaders are expected in Russia next Thursday for a meeting of the Group of 20 big economies, an event that could influence the timing of any strikes. The hosts have made clear their view that Western leaders are using human rights as a pretext to impose their will on other sovereign states.

A spokesman for the main Syrian opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Coalition, said the opposition was confident Western leaders were prepared to act.

SNC leader Ahmed Jarba met French President Francois Hollande. An SNC spokesman said they discussed a two-wave intervention to first target installations used to launch chemical weapons and then hit other government bases in Syria.

"We are very happy. France and its partners are quite decided to punish the Syrian regime," SNC envoy Monzer Makhous told Reuters after the talks. "Then there will be military aid to help the opposition to change the balance of power."

Hollande urged Jarba to create a credible military force, highlighting Western concern that the mainstream opposition is unable to control al Qaeda-linked militias on the ground in Syria. Syrian officials say the West is playing into the hands of its al Qaeda enemies.

In Damascus, residents and opposition forces said Assad's forces appeared to have evacuated most personnel from army and security command headquarters in the centre in preparation for Western military action.

People unable to decide whether to leave for neighboring Lebanon said the border was already jammed.

"We're hearing people are spending hours - like 12 or 14 hours - waiting in line at the border," said Nabil, who was considering leaving town for Beirut with his wife and young daughter, "just until the strike is over."

Diplomats based in the Middle East told Reuters the removal of some of Assad's Scud missiles and launchers from the foothills of the Qalamoun mountains, one of Syria's most heavily militarized districts, appeared to be part of a precautionary but limited redeployment of armaments.

Despite opinion polls showing most Americans oppose deeper involvement in the Syrian conflict, Obama has been under pressure to enforce a "red line" against chemical weapons use, which he declared just over a year ago.

"I have no interest in any open-ended conflict in Syria, but we do have to make sure that when countries break international norms on weapons like chemical weapons that could threaten us, that they are held accountable," Obama said.

The likeliest option, U.S. officials say, would be to launch cruise missiles from U.S. ships in the Mediterranean in a campaign that would last days.

A fifth U.S. destroyer, the USS Stout, was headed toward the coast off Syria, according to one defense official. That would bring the total of U.S. destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean to five, although the Stout is likely to relieve the USS Mahan, which had been due to return to its U.S. base but stayed in the region due to the situation in Syria.

Still the decision to replace the Mahan with another destroyer means the United States will be maintaining an expanded presence in the region.

poor neighbor could last for months, and Minsk threatened to open a criminal case against a Russian tycoon with Kremlin ties.

The close but often rocky relationship between the ex-Soviet states hit a major bump this week when Vladislav Baumgertner, the chief executive of potash company Uralkali, was arrested in Minsk.

On Wednesday, Russia ordered its oil companies to cut supplies to Belarus by about 25 percent, prompting talk of a trade war. Belarus relies entirely on Russian oil to keep its two major refineries running to supply the local market.

Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft said on Wednesday Russia would cut oil supplies to Belarus by 400,000 tonnes in September due to maintenance work at the trunk pipeline.

On Thursday, Russian news agencies quoted Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich as saying Belarus would receive reduced volumes of oil in the fourth quarter, indicating the cuts would carry on long past September.

"On the basis of planned oil deliveries for 2013 and on the volumes which already have been shipped, the cuts in oil supplies will surely affect the fourth quarter," the government press service cited Dvorkovich as saying, according to Interfax.

In Belarus, state investigators raised the prospect of also prosecuting billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, the top shareholder in Uralkali, which controls 20 percent of the world potash market.

"The materials that the Investigative Committee of Belarus possesses do not rule out the possibility of opening a criminal case in relation to Suleiman Kerimov, as well as other individuals," committee representative Pavel Traulko said.

An attempt to take on Kerimov, who was reported to be in Russia, would raise the stakes in the standoff, which unfolded following Uralkali's decision to break away from a marketing venture between the company and state-owned Belaruskali.

Kerimov, a 47-year-old native of the Caucasus province of Dagestan in southern Russia, has close ties to President Vladimir Putin's administration and completed a Kremlin-backed Russian potash merger in 2011.

The world market for potash has long been dominated by a handful of players led by the Belarusian Potash Co (BPC), a marketing venture between Uralkali and Belaruskali.

BPC and Canpotex, which groups North American firms Potash Corp, Agrium and Mosaic, together have controlled 70 percent of sales.

But Uralkali quit the cartel on July 30, angered by a law passed in Belarus last year that allowed Belaruskali to sell product outside the marketing venture.

Belarus relies on Russia not only for energy but also for economic handouts and as a counterweight to the European Union and the United States, which shun President Alexander Lukashenko because of his treatment of opponents and lack of tolerance for dissent.

For Russia, landlocked Belarus serves as a buffer with NATO, and Putin needs it as a member of economic and security alliances as he seeks loser integration among the nations of the former Soviet Union.

headline: Berlusconi masterminded tax evasion plan, Italian court says
byline: By Gavin Jones
6:20pm EDT

Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was the mastermind behind a complex system of tax evasion by his holding company Fininvest, Italy's highest appeals court said on Thursday.

The Court of Cassation, which published the reasons for its decision earlier this month to uphold Berlusconi's conviction for tax fraud, pulled no punches in a 208-page document which dismissed all the media tycoon's arguments in his defense.

The court's ruling on August 1 threw Italian politics into disarray when it handed Berlusconi his first definitive jail sentence, of four years commuted to one.

Under a law passed by Mario Monti's government last year that conviction means Berlusconi, who sits in the Senate, also faces the risk of expulsion from parliament.

Berlusconi was "directly responsible for the masterminding, creation and development" of a system set up "with the aim of evading Italian taxes," the Court of Cassation said.

The publication of the document by the panel of five judges throws an unwelcome spotlight back on Berlusconi's legal woes, which threaten to upset Enrico Letta's unstable government.

The government has bickered continuously since taking office in April but won a respite on Wednesday when it reached agreement over reform of a housing tax that had been a constant source of division between the left-right coalition of former rivals.

Letta faces a bigger hurdle on September 9 when a Senate panel meets to begin deciding whether Berlusconi should be thrown out of parliament. Berlusconi's allies have threatened to bring down the government if Letta's Democratic Party (PD) vote to oust him, as they have said they will.

Berlusconi said in a television interview with his Italia Uno channel on Thursday that his tax fraud sentence was "based on nothing," and that millions of Italians "will not permit" his expulsion.

Under the law passed last year, deputies or Senators convicted of criminal offences can be expelled. Berlusconi's lawyers have argued the law cannot apply to him as it was passed after the offences for which he was convicted.

Berlusconi, who insists he is the victim of a politically motivated court, is showing all his renowned fighting spirit.

He plans to appeal to Italy's constitutional court against the tax fraud verdict. His People of Freedom party (PDL) says the Senate should wait for that ruling before deciding whether he must leave parliament.

However, even if the constitutional court agrees to hear his case, it may take years to reach a decision, and Berlusconi's opponents say he is just playing for time.

Berlusconi has also appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

In addition to the tax fraud case, he is fighting a 7-year jail sentence issued by a Milan court this year for paying for sex with an under-aged prostitute and abusing his office to cover it up.

headline: Russia sends warships to Mediterranean as Syria tension rises
byline: By Timothy Heritage
6:20pm EDT

Russia said on Thursday it was sending warships to the Mediterranean, but denied it was beefing up its naval force there as Western powers prepare for military action against Syria.

Interfax news agency quoted a source in the armed forces' general staff as saying Russia, Syria's most powerful ally, was deploying a missile cruiser from the Black Sea Fleet and a large anti-submarine ship from the Northern Fleet in the "coming days".

Any strengthening of the navy's presence could fuel tension, especially as the United States has said it is repositioning naval forces in the Mediterranean following an alleged chemical weapons attack which it blames on Syrian government forces.

"The well-known situation now in the eastern Mediterranean required us to make some adjustments to the naval force," the source said in a reference to the events in Syria.

It was not clear when the vessels would arrive but Interfax said the missile cruiser Moskva was currently in the North Atlantic and would set sail in the next few days.

President Vladimir Putin has said the naval presence is needed to protect national security interests and is not a threat to any nation. Russia cooperates with NATO navies against piracy and its ships call at Western ports.

The navy later said a deployment was imminent in the Mediterranean but suggested it would not increase the size of Russian forces there.

"This is not a new group ... but a planned rotation," the state-run RIA news agency quoted an unnamed naval official as saying.

SECRECY

Confusion has at times surrounded Russian deployments in the Mediterranean because of the secrecy involved.

Both RIA and Interfax later quoted the Defence Ministry as saying that in the rotation, to be conducted from September 1-7, a destroyer and two landing ships would replace a frigate and three landing ships in the Mediterranean.

Separately, the Defence Ministry website said the Moskva, which Interfax had reported was headed to the Mediterranean, was leaving Venezuela but would remain in the Atlantic for now.

Washington accuses Syrian government forces of carrying out last week's chemical weapons attack and has made clear it could soon launch a military strike.

Russia is one of Assad's biggest arms suppliers. It opposes any military intervention in Syria and has shielded Damascus against further sanctions at the U.N. Security Council.

Defence experts said the deployment of the two warships identified by Interfax could give Assad early warning of cruise missile launches, particularly by submarine, or jam radars or navigation systems, although they might never be used for this.

"What we may be seeing here is an example of gunboat diplomacy rather than a deliberate attempt to interfere directly in any coalition strike militarily," said Lee Willett, editor of IHS Jane's Navy International.

"The simple presence of any ships will have an impact politically, and that is the primary intent."

Russia's chief of staff said in June the navy had stationed 16 warships and three ship-based helicopters in the Mediterranean, its first permanent naval deployment there since Soviet times.

headline: Hungary's leftist opposition forms alliance for 2014 vote
byline: By Krisztina Than and Marton Dunai
6:20pm EDT

Hungary's two main opposition parties joined forces ahead of an election due in 2014, an alliance that could pose a real challenge to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling party which has so far benefited from deep divisions on the left.

The Socialist Party and former Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai's Egyutt 2014 agreed on Thursday on a mechanism to decide who will be their joint candidate for prime minister - an issue that caused months of wrangling - and pledged to split the field for parliamentary seats and support each other's candidates.

Orban's conservative party, Fidesz, has a firm lead in opinion polls ahead of the vote, due in April or May. But about half of Hungarian voters are undecided and the economy is barely growing after a recession last year.

Voters in Hungary's election system cast two votes: one for individual candidates and one for the preferred party.

According to the pact, although the two leftist parties will essentially field joint candidates for constituencies in parliament, they will still run as separate parties.

If Orban is defeated, the party which wins more votes in the party vote will nominate the prime minister, and the other party will accept that result, without conditions.

"The alliance that will replace Viktor Orban has been born today," Socialist leader Attila Mesterhazy told Reuters. "Everyone is satisfied with this, and now all voters can choose the candidate closest to their liking."

"The cooperation is of one hundred percent. The differences have been worked out in an hour and a half between Mr. Bajnai and myself, and our confidence in each other is complete."

The Socialists will field candidates in 75 of Hungary's 106 constituencies and Egyutt 2014 in the remaining 31, according to the agreement.

"This day is the end of a difficult start for the opposition and the beginning of the end for the Orban regime," Egyutt (Together) 2014 said in a statement.

DIFFERENCES ASIDE

Mesterhazy's Socialist Party evolved from the communists who ruled Hungary from 1956 to 1989 and has stronger support in opinion polls than Egyutt 2014.

Bajnai led a Socialist government from 2009 to 2010 that introduced painful spending cuts to put the economy back on a sustainable path.

The deal comes less than a week after talks between the two parties stalled over the premiership issue.

"This solution allows the leftist parties to address a wider electoral base than in a full-on alliance," said Peter Kreko, analyst at think tank Political Capital.

"Those who are weary of Bajnai can vote for the Socialists (in the party vote) and vice versa.

"The leftists can profit from this setup if they rest their differences on the national level and both compete against Orban. That can improve them. If their conflicts remain, Fidesz will walk home with the easy win," he said.

In the last poll by pollster Ipsos in August, public support for Fidesz was at 26 percent, while the Socialists (MSZP) scored 15 percent and Egyutt had 4 percent. Some 43 percent of those polled said they were still undecided.

held Damascus neighborhood, U.S. national security officials said on Thursday.

In secret intelligence assessments and a still-unreleased report summarizing U.S. intelligence on the alleged gas attack on August 21, U.S. agencies express high confidence that Syrian government forces carried out the attack, and that Assad's government therefore bears responsibility, the officials said.

"This was not a rogue operation," one U.S. official said.

However the evidence does not prove that Assad himself ordered that chemical munitions be used, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Evidence that forces loyal to Assad were responsible goes beyond the circumstantial to include electronic intercepts and some tentative scientific samples from the neighborhood which was attacked, officials said.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Admiral James A. Winnefeld Jr, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are among senior U.S. officials who will brief senior members of Congress on Thursday about the situation in Syria and related intelligence assessments, congressional aides said.

President Barack Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper will also participate in the briefing. With many members of Congress out of Washington during the summer recess, the briefing will be held in a telephone conference call at 6 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT), according to the aides.

They said the briefing had originally been meant to be classified, but too many members of Congress were unable to get to secure telephone lines for it to include top secret material.

While Obama has not yet announced a decision on military action, he has left little doubt the choice was not whether but when to punish Assad's government for the attack, in which hundreds of people died.

Some Republican lawmakers and even some of Obama's fellow Democrats have complained that they have not been properly informed.

USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS

Thursday's briefing is for leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives as well as the chairmen and ranking members of national security committees, including foreign relations, intelligence and armed services.

During the week, U.S. government spokespeople have made increasingly emphatic statements declaring that chemical weapons were used and that Assad's government, rather than rebel forces, were responsible for using them.

"This was a massive, large-scale ... multiple-faceted attack against a wide swath of area using very sophisticated rockets, very sophisticated delivery systems that were armed with chemical weapons. There is one party in Syria who has the capability to do that, and it's the Assad regime," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said on Wednesday.

Harf added that U.S. officials "ultimately, of course, hold President Assad responsible for the use of chemical weapons by his regime against his own people, regardless of where the command and control lies."

U.S. security sources and sources close to allied governments say evidence suggests that the initial decision to use chemical weapons may have been made by a field commander rather than in an order from the highest level of the Syrian government.

In a paper published on Thursday, the British government's Joint Intelligence Committee said: "Permission to authorize CW (chemical weapons) has probably been delegated by President Assad to senior regime commanders, such as, but any deliberate change in the scale and nature of use would require his authorization."

The name of the commander or commanders was redacted from the public version of the paper.

According to a former U.S. official who is an expert in the region, one possibility is that the Syrian ground commander in charge of clearing out the area which was attacked, under heavy pressure from superiors, may have made the initial decision to use chemical weapons before sending in ground troops. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.

U.S. intelligence did intercept communications discussing the attack between officials in central command and in the field. But these do not clearly implicate Assad or his entourage in ordering the use of chemicals, sources familiar with the material said.

While U.S. experts say the most likely chemical agent used in the attack was the nerve gas sarin, scientific evidence proving this still remains incomplete, one of the sources added.

Prime Minister David Cameron's plans for joining a looming military strike on Syria were in disarray on Thursday after a revolt by lawmakers warning him to heed the "lessons of Iraq".

After imploring the world not to stand idly by over Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons, Cameron was forced into an awkward climbdown on Wednesday when the opposition Labour party as well as lawmakers in his own Conservative party said they wanted more evidence before voting for military action.

On Thursday, Cameron's government published legal advice it had been given which it said showed it was legally entitled to take military action against Syria even if the United Nations Security Council did not approve such action.

It also published intelligence material on the August 21 chemical weapons attack in Syria's civil war, saying there was no doubt that it had occurred and that it was "highly likely" Syrian government forces were responsible. The nerve gas attack killed hundreds of civilians in an embattled suburb of Damascus.

It was unclear how Cameron's failure to master domestic British politics could affect U.S. and French plans for a swift cruise missile strike against Syria - whose government has denied using chemical weapons against its citizens - or what the impact would be on Cameron's standing in Washington.

Aides said he had not spoken to U.S. President Barack Obama since suffering the parliamentary reversal, but that there had been regular contacts at other levels.

Dogging Cameron's steps is the memory of events a decade ago, when Britain helped the United States to invade Iraq after asserting - wrongly, as it later turned out - that President Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.

"I am deeply mindful of the lessons of previous conflicts, and in particular the deep concerns in the country caused by what went wrong with the Iraq conflict in 2003," Cameron told parliament on Thursday during a debate on Syria.

"One thing is indisputable: the well of public opinion was well and truly poisoned by the Iraq episode and we need to understand the public skepticism."

Already embroiled in Afghanistan, Britain was then sucked into a second quagmire in Iraq, losing 179 soldiers in eight years of militant attacks and sectarian conflict following the 2003 U.S.-British invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.

POISONOUS IRAQ LEGACY

It was the defining moment of Tony Blair's 1997-2007 premiership, provoking huge protests, divisions within his Labour Party and accusations that his government misled the public by manufacturing the case for war.

Obama has set out the case for a limited military strike on Syria, but some U.S. lawmakers say they have not been properly consulted.

British Conservative officials were furious at the delay, accusing Labour leader Ed Miliband of opportunism.

"Ed Miliband is playing politics when he should be thinking about the national interest and global security," a Conservative source told Reuters. "He keeps changing his position, not out of principle but to achieve political advantage."

A senior Conservative source added: "A lot of the arguments over this could give succor to the (Syrian) regime".

Miliband replied: "We have got to learn the lessons of Iraq because people remember the mistakes that were made ... I am not willing to make those mistakes again." He advised lawmakers not to rush to judgment "on a political timetable set elsewhere".

Domestically, Cameron's authority looks dented. Part of his problem is that he governs as part of a two-party coalition because his Conservatives lack an absolute majority in parliament, exposing him to such impromptu revolts.

After hours of negotiations between Cameron's political managers and the opposition, his office agreed that the U.N. Security Council should see findings from chemical weapons inspectors before it responded militarily and that parliament should hold two votes on military action.

That meant that parliament would vote later on Thursday on a government motion cautioning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and authorizing military action in principle only.

It will need to vote again to authorize any direct military action. Labour said it would vote against the government on Thursday, while Syria wrote letters to British lawmakers urging them to avoid reckless action.

A YouGov poll published on Thursday showed opposition to a Syria action hardening, with 51 percent of the British public opposing a missile strike, and just 22 percent in favor of it. Opponents say Britain has neither the money nor the evidence to justify further military action in the Middle East.

Tropical Storm Juliette blew through the Pacific Mexican tourist resort of Cabo San Lucas early on Thursday, killing one man, knocking down trees and causing electricity blackouts, local emergency services said.

By mid-morning, Juliette had weakened as it moved along the west coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula, about 80 miles northwest of Cabo San Lazaro, with winds of 40 mph, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.

But the storm left a trail of destruction, said Carlos Enriquez, head of emergency services in the state of Baja California Sur. One man was electrocuted in the storm and about 1,650 people had to be given shelter overnight.

"Trees came down, electricity posts too, and the power supply was suspended, although it has since been re-established. The roads are also now operating again," said Enriquez.

He said he expected the worst of the storm was over, although authorities were still checking the damage.

Mexican state oil monopoly Pemex has no major refineries or installations in the area.

A Sri Lankan minister on Thursday accused U.N. Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay of acting without transparency in evaluating the country four years after the end of its civil war and said her report would be unfair.

A United Nations panel has said it has "credible allegations" that Sri Lankan troops and rebels both committed atrocities and war crimes during the 26-year conflict, and singled out the government for most of the blame.

Amid protests for and against a seven-day visit to assess human rights, Pillay visited former northern war zones in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Trincomalee in the east.

Housing Minister Wimal Weerawansa, leader of the National Freedom Front, a hardline nationalist party in President Mahinda Rajapaksa's coalition, criticized Pillay's itinerary.

"There is a problem about whether she is working with transparency," Weerawansa told reporters in Colombo. "In Trincomalee yesterday, she secretly met some people who were not in the normal schedule. She is also scheduled to meet some people who are critical of the country. So our view is, she is not going to submit a fair report (to the U.N.)."

Government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said Pillay had freedom to meet whomever she chose during her visit. Her official visit will end on Saturday with a news conference.

External Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris met Pillay on Thursday and told her that Colombo would accept "constructive and justified criticism" but rejects "vicious and baseless positions which are incessantly repeated", Peiris's ministry said.

Pillay's spokesman Rupert Colville said she was doing what human rights high commissioners always do on such missions. "They talk to a wide range of people and collect a variety of views on human rights issues in the country in question," Colville told Reuters in an emailed statement.

Pillay's visit followed a second U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution in March this year that urged Sri Lanka to carry out credible investigations into killings and disappearances during the war, especially in the final stages.

The Sri Lanka government battled separatist Tamil guerrillas from 1983 until 2009.

India's lower house of parliament approved land reforms on Thursday that boost farmers' rights but are opposed by other businesses who say the new law will thwart efforts to revive the floundering economy.

The government says the bill, which will replace a muddled law dating back to the 19th century, will help speed up industrial investment by making the rules clearer.

With the rupee's value tumbling along with other vulnerable emerging market currencies, India is struggling to finance its current account deficit and its leaders are desperate to promote economic growth.

But many are skeptical about the land bill, which is seen as a vote winner for the governing United Progressive Alliance (UPA) coalition because it will give farmers up to four times the market rate for land bought for industry and infrastructure.

"We believe that the land bill strikes a fair balance," India's finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters.

"Land has to be made available, but while land is being either purchased or acquired to make land available for industry, we must also keep in mind that those who are deprived of land are in most cases deprived of the only asset they have."

Another bill, passed on Monday, offers subsidized food to two-thirds of India's 1.2 billion population, fuelling criticism that lawmakers are more concerned with elections due by May 2014 than in building a strong economy.

"It's populist. They want to appease the farmers," said Paras Adenwala, MD and Principal Portfolio Manager, Capital Portfolio Advisors. "The UPA is making ground for election by these bills."

Indian shares fell by more than 3 percent the day after the food security bill was passed, on worries the scheme would overshoot the government's annual cost estimate of $20 billion.

Both pieces of legislation must be passed by the upper house before becoming law.

Farmers protesting against what they see as unfair land acquisitions have stalled projects in recent years.

The bill's pricing rules would oblige developers to pay up to four times the market rate for land in rural areas and twice the rate in urban areas. Displaced people must also be given homes and jobs.

"This bill will protect farmers and the rights of farmers," said Dushyant Naagar, the head of a farmers' lobby group in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. He predicted that the generous pricing would help unclog project bottlenecks.

Other farmers' groups say the bill does not provide adequate compensation.

However, businesses say the new rules will raise costs and could even slow down acquisitions because of a requirement that four-fifths of all landholders concerned in a sale give their consent before any land is acquired for a private project.

For joint public-private projects, 70 percent of landowners must consent.

"In the present scenario of economic crisis, this bill will further hit investment and growth of industrialization, employment and infrastructure," said Vikash Sharan, the director of the Indian unit of Posco, a South Korean steelmaker.

Posco has faced years of protests from farmers opposed to a steel mill in the eastern Indian state of Odisha that would be the country's largest single foreign investment project.

In a statement, business lobby group the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) said getting consent from 80 percent of land-holders "will be very difficult, if not impossible."

India's economic growth slowed to a decade low of 5 percent in 2012-13 and the rupee has lost over 20 percent of its value during the last three months. It hit an all-time low of 68.85 against the dollar on Wednesday.

Gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the first quarter of 2013-14 are due to be released on Friday.

Rwanda accused the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday of shelling Rwandan territory and killing a woman, saying such "provocation" could no longer be tolerated.

The comments by Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo contained some of the strongest language used so far by Rwanda, which has repeatedly sent its military into Congo's east during years of violence in the mineral-rich region.

"The persistent shelling of Rwandan territory is unacceptable," Mushikiwabo said in a statement.

"We have remained restrained for as long as we can but this provocation can no longer be tolerated."

"We have the capacity to determine who fired at us and will not hesitate to defend our territory. Rwanda has a responsibility to protect its population," she said, without saying what action might be taken.

Rwanda accused the Congolese army of firing a shell that killed a woman and seriously injured her two-month-old baby in a market in Rubavu town on Thursday morning, followed by a second shortly after that wounded another person.

Residents and a Rwandan official had earlier said two people died in Thursday's shelling.

The Foreign Ministry said the Congolese had fired 34 rounds into Rwanda in the past month.

Last week, a 3,000-strong United Nations intervention brigade with a mandate to neutralize armed groups launched an operation in eastern Congo against a rebel group widely believed to be backed by Rwanda.

Rwanda denies backing the so-called M23 rebellion but fears are growing the violence in Congo could spill across borders.

A diplomat in the Great Lakes region told Reuters it was clear rebels had received support from Rwanda to help counter the U.N. force's aerial and ground assault over the past week.

The Rwandan minister said Kigali had repeatedly called on Congo to halt the attacks but that they had increased. She accused the international community of failing to do enough to control the situation in eastern Congo.

exporting country.

Mahama narrowly clinched December's vote with 50.7 percent of the ballot but the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) had alleged fraud ranging from inflated tallies to the participation of unregistered voters.

Justice William Atuguba, president of the nine-member panel, told a packed courthouse in downtown Accra that the tribunal had dismissed the opposition appeal - a ruling broadcast live to the transfixed West African nation.

"The overall effect is that the first respondent (Mahama) was validly elected," Atuguba said.

Supporters of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) broke into song when the ruling was announced. Opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo expressed disappointment but said his party would abide by the court ruling.

"Our reaction to this judgment will be watched keenly in Africa and beyond and will set a precedent for generations to follow," he told reporters. "It is now up to all Ghanaians to put the disputes behind us and come together."

Many in Ghana hope the court's detailed ruling - broadcast live across the nation of 25 million people - will set a precedent on a continent where election challenges are often swept under the carpet.

Legal experts had expected the court to dismiss the opposition case, saying it had failed to conclusively prove a level of fraud that would have changed the election result.

"Let peace rein. This is a victory for Ghana's democracy," Mahama said via his Twitter feed.

Most shops in central Accra were shuttered and the streets quiet as many Ghanaians watched the verdict at home. Police had sealed off main streets leading to the court, where helicopters hovered overhead, part of a deployment of 30,000 officers nationwide in case of any violence.

The ruling should settle the political scene in Ghana - Africa's number two gold miner and the world's second-largest cocoa producer. It has built a reputation for political stability in turbulent West Africa.

Ghana's $39 billion economy has been powering ahead, growing 8 percent last year, after oil production began at Tullow's Jubilee field in 2010.

"We expect this confidence to calm the foreign exchange market," said economist Joe Abbey of Accra-based CEPA. The Ghanaian cedi has slipped more than 10 percent against the dollar so far this year.

However, some analysts said investors' attention would now shift back to the government's efforts to trim a budget deficit which climbed to more than 12 percent of GDP last year.

"Although an important element of uncertainty has been removed with the court verdict, it is unlikely that we will see a significant market impact," said Razia Khan, Africa analyst at Standard Chartered bank. "Investors will pay careful attention to any measures aimed at achieving fiscal consolidation."

byline: By Denis Dyomkin
6:20pm EDT

President Vladimir Putin ordered an inquiry on Thursday into local officials' handling of Russia's worst floods in 120 years, which have cost the country nearly $1 billion.

Putin made the announcement after visiting devastated regions in Russia's far east where houses are half-submerged, streets and fields have disappeared under water and thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes.

Putin's call for an investigation appeared intended to show he is firmly in charge after protests against him in big cities last year, and that he is ready to defend voters' interests.

State television, which has often tried to burnish Putin's action-man image, showed him peering through a plane window and looking stern as he flew over stricken areas where the roofs of houses were barely visible above the muddy water.

"There are some people who doubt that all officials, including those in charge of hydroenergy facilities, acted strictly in line with the relevant guidelines and current legislation," Putin told officials at a meeting in the city of Khabarovsk, close to the border with China.

"The actions of all officials must be thoroughly investigated and analyzed, and (the results) reported to me."

Asked by the officials how they should handle the floods, he replied bluntly: "I don't expect any heroic deeds. You just need to do your duty professionally, work hard and be honest."

Anyone suspected of incompetence could face criminal charges. Four local officials in southern Russia were convicted of criminal negligence this month for failing to alert residents to floods last year which killed more than 170 people.

Punishing local officials offers central authorities a way of heading off criticism in a country that is often hit by natural disasters and has a poor record on industrial and transport accidents.

No deaths have been reported in the floods, which followed rain and have lasted several weeks. But thousands have been evacuated from their homes, farmland has been damaged and the authorities put the damage at 30 billion roubles ($900 million).

One local emergencies official said the cost could rise to 50 billion roubles, as Russia tries to avoid slipping into recession.

Putin, who wore a dark anorak and open shirt, promised compensation for victims. He has pressed on with his trip despite the prospect of Western military strikes against Russia's ally, Syria, over a suspected chemical weapons attack.

headline: Fledgling democracy could survive in crisis-hit Tunisia

led government and secular opposition that could be decisive for the success of its experiment in democracy.

The small North African nation could still make this work, if its political class can rise above party rivalries to follow a road map to the rule of law laid out in 2011, analysts say.

Optimism has waxed and waned over the past week as the central figure of Tunisian politics, Islamist leader Rached Ghannouchi, offered to consider a deal for new elections that could produce an orderly transfer of power to the opposition.

The ensuing squabbling in his Ennahda party and in the opposition, which responded by demanding the Ennahda-led government's immediate resignation, dampened the initial hopes his offer had stirred. Then upbeat comments by main opposition leader Beji Caid Essebsi brightened prospects again.

"Tunisia risks a lot in this crisis but it is not going to collapse," said political analyst Jamel Arfoui. "It will continue its transition because Ghannouchi is trying to find solutions to avoid an Egyptian scenario."

A replay of the Egyptian army's bloody crushing of the once- dominant Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is hardly on the cards in Tunisia, where army coups are unknown and politics has rough edges but not the life-and-death polarization haunting Cairo.

Instead of taking an us-versus-them stand, the only independent force in Tunisia that can play a role anything like that of Egypt's army - the powerful UGTT trade union federation - has stepped in to mediate between Islamists and secularists.

"CANNY OPERATOR"

Crucially, Ghannouchi has read opposition protests as a sign it is time to compromise, not cling to power at all costs as Egypt's deposed Islamist President Mohamed Mursi tried to do.

"Ghannouchi is definitely a democrat," said Geoffrey Howard, North Africa analyst for the Control Risks consultancy group in London. "He's also a very canny operator."

Tunisia's latest crisis erupted in late July when Salafi Islamist militants assassinated a secular politician, the second such killing this year.

Accusing Ennahda of incompetence and laxity towards Islamist radicals, opposition parties called huge rallies to demand it immediately make way for a caretaker cabinet to hold new polls.

The head of the assembly writing a new constitution, which was elected in October 2011 with a one-year deadline that it missed, then suspended its work because of the unrest.

This meant Tunisia, whose current government was only meant to run affairs during a one-year transition, had strayed from the road map calling for a new constitution and then a caretaker cabinet to oversee voting for a fully democratic parliament.

The Egyptian army's ousting of Mursi on July 3 had already dealt a body blow to Islamist hopes of reshaping Muslim nations on more religious lines after decades of secular one-man rule.

These pressures seem to have prompted Ghannouchi, who during exile in Britain concluded that democracies offer religions more freedom than autocracies, to seek a consensus on new elections.

The problem now is to weather the transition. Ennahda has alienated many Tunisians by stressing its Islamist agenda while failing to tackle the country's economic and security problems.

It also aroused suspicion by placing its lieutenants in key administrative posts around the nation of 11 million, drawing charges that it could not be trusted to organize fair elections.

RUMBLINGS IN ENNAHDA

Over the past two weeks, Ghannouchi has accepted UGTT mediation for the transition and held an unprecedented meeting with opposition leader Essebsi, previously shunned by Ennahda as a relic of Tunisia's old order, to start discussing its details.

In one oft-mentioned scenario, work on the constitution would resume immediately and be finished by October 23, after which all-party talks would agree on a neutral caretaker cabinet to take over from Ennahda and quickly hold new elections.

But there are rumblings in Ennahda, especially among those who spent years in prison under former President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and who oppose compromise with Essebsi's Nida Tounes party because it represents many officials who served under him.

The emerging consensus has also sidelined Ennahda's two secular coalition partners, especially the Congress for the Republic (CPR) party whose trademark project - a law to ban those former Ben Ali officials from politics - has fallen victim to Ghannouchi's rapprochement with the opposition.

The leftist Popular Front is wary of Essebsi's cooperation with Ghannouchi because it wants his Nida Tounes party as an ally against Ennahda in the coming elections. It has called for more protests to pressure the government to resign now.

CLOSE BUT STILL FAR FROM GOAL

Wrangling over the constitution has been long and hard, with four months alone spent debating whether to mention sharia law in a special article, but the latest draft is almost finished without the controversial religious elements Ennahda wanted.

"The constitution is almost ready," said Amna Guellali, Tunisia researcher for Human Rights Watch. "If they have a political agreement, the rest can be done quite quickly."

But pre-election politics, with Ennahda casting its time in power in the best light and its foes jockeying for advantage, could throw up new hurdles to completing the transition.

Howard, the risk analyst, said he expected a technocratic government to emerge eventually, but predicted serious unrest if elections were delayed beyond the first quarter of 2014.

"The greatest danger is popular discontent," he said.



headline: Saudi Arabia passes kingdom's first domestic abuse law
byline: By Mahmoud Habboush
6:20pm EDT

Saudi Arabia has passed landmark legislation aimed at protecting women, children and domestic workers against domestic abuse, a human rights official said on Thursday, in a move aimed at reducing hidden violence against women in the kingdom.

The "Protection from Abuse" law is the first of its kind in the ultra-conservative country, which has often faced international criticism for lacking laws that protect women and domestic workers against abuse.

The law, approved during a cabinet meeting on August 26, came several months after a local charity launched a nationwide campaign to combat violence against women.

Under the 17-article bill, those found guilty of committing psychological or physical abuse could face prison sentences of up to one year and up to 50,000 riyals ($13,300) in fines.

licensed body, told Reuters.

Previously, domestic violence against women, children or domestic workers was treated under a general penal code based on Islamic sharia law.

Judges were left to decide according to their understanding of sharia codes, which were seen as permitting mild application of violence against "disobedient" wives and generally treated domestic violence as a private matter.

"We are always in favor of an explicit law that does not need interpretations or personal judgment," said Fakher, whose organization helped draft the law.

The United Nations urged the kingdom, a U.S. ally which follows the strict Wahhabi school of Islam, to create laws to protect women as early as 2008.

The Supreme Judicial Council in 2007 condemned a 19-year-old woman to 200 lashes and six months in jail on a charge of having been with a man she was not related to after she was attacked and gang-raped. She was pardoned by King Abdullah.

The King Khalid Foundation in April launched an unprecedented campaign to raise awareness about violence against women. The campaign's main poster, which featured a woman wearing a veil that showed one of her eyes blackened, was widely circulated on the Internet.

Underneath the picture, a caption read: "Some things can't be covered - fighting women's abuse together."

Fakher said one reason domestic violence was rampant in Saudi Arabia was because tribal traditions prevented women from reporting abuse for fear of social stigma.

"Women think what the community would say about her if she filed a complaint," he said.

There has also been an increase in reports of cases of domestic abuse in which families mistreat their maids, sometimes resulting in them turning on the children of their employers.

Rizana Nafeek, a Sri Lankan maid, was beheaded in the town of Dawadmy, near the capital Riyadh, in January after she was sentenced to death in 2007. She was accused by her employer of killing his infant daughter while she was bottle-feeding.

The law gives those who report abuse the right to remain anonymous, as well as immunity from litigation should abuse fail to be proven in a court. It also urges witnesses to report abuse without having to disclose their identity, which Fakher said is a significant part of the law.

Rights activist Waleed Abu al-Khair said the new law gives women some independence.

"Women were required to bring in a male relative if they showed up at a police station to file a complaint," Abu al-Khair said. This will not now be necessary, he said.

The law could be a step towards changing current regulations which require women to get approval of male guardians - fathers, husbands or sons - to carry out business, apply for jobs or travel outside the country, Abu al-Khair said.



headline: Pakistan overturns jail term of doctor who helped find bin Laden
byline: By Jibran Ahmad
6:20pm EDT

year jail term handed down to a doctor who helped CIA agents find al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, a decision which may result in a new trial.

Shakil Afridi, hailed as a hero by U.S. officials, was arrested after U.S. special forces killed bin Laden in May 2011 in the town of Abbottabad in a secret raid that outraged Pakistan and strained relations between the strategic allies.

Afridi's conviction in 2012 further soured the atmosphere. U.S. senators withheld $33 million in aid in retaliation.

Pakistani officials initially said Afridi was charged with treason for helping the United States, but court documents showed he was jailed for being a member of a militant group, Lashkar-e-Islam.

On Thursday, senior judicial official Sahibzada Mohammad Anees overturned the ruling on the grounds that another official had exceeded his authority when handing down last year's sentence.

"The assistant political agent ... did not have the authority to award 33 years' imprisonment to Dr. Shakil Afridi," said a written judgment. "The assistant political agent played the role of a magistrate for which he was not authorized."

Afridi was not present at Thursday's hearing in the city of Peshawar and remains in custody. A political agent and his assistant are representatives of the Pakistani government in the semiautonomous tribal areas, which are not covered by the country's judicial system.

Afridi was accused of running a fake vaccination campaign, in which he collected DNA samples, that is believed to have helped the American intelligence agency track down bin Laden.

LINGERING TENSION

Relations between Pakistan and the United States have since slowly improved but residual distrust lingers.

A new trial would raise the prospect of his release but if he were freed, Afridi would probably have to leave Pakistan. Militant groups have long threatened to kill him, and Pakistani authorities have said they fear for his life even in jail.

Lawyer Samiullah Afridi said Afridi planned to submit an application for an early hearing. He will also be allowed to use lawyers in the next trial, a legal privilege he was previously denied. Afridi has denied the charges against him and a spokesman for the group said they had no ties with him.

"Shakil was himself kidnapped by militants," Afridi's lawyer told Reuters. "He had to pay a lot of money for his release. There is no question that a person like him would treat militants or give them funds."

The review of Afridi's case will be conducted under the auspices of the political agent of Khyber Agency who is trained as a judge, Anees said in his statement. It will be up to the agent to decide whether a new trial is needed.

Anees is a commissioner with responsibility for law in Pakistan's tribal areas, which are governed by colonial-era legislation known as the Frontier Crimes Regulation.

"An order for a re-trial implies a judgment on the quality of the earlier order, not just on the authority of the officer who gave the order," said lawyer Ahmer Bilal Soofi, an expert in the Frontier Crimes Regulation.

"The judicial official could have reduced his sentence, if that was the problem. But he did not. He overturned the entire order."

headline: Santos calls for calm as Colombian farm protests reach Bogota
byline: By Helen Murphy and Peter Murphy
6:20pm EDT

Thousands of Colombian farmers will march through the streets of Bogota on Thursday, converging on the capital after 11 days of increasingly violent protests around the country against agricultural and trade policies they say have left them impoverished.

President Juan Manuel Santos, who has been unable to end the so-called national strike that has united potato growers and milk producers with teachers and health workers, acknowledged agriculture is in crisis but called for peaceful dissent while talks about possible solutions are going on.

"The farm sector has been abandoned," the center-right president said in a televised address early on Thursday. "The protests are valid ... but via dialogue we will resolve the problems. ... We are in a storm but we will persevere."

The labor disputes, in which farmers have blocked roads to snarl transportation into cities, pile pressure on Santos just three months before he must decide whether to run for a second term. At the same time, the government's tough peace negotiations with Marxist FARC rebels are creating their own contentious national debate.

Santos said he will lift import duties on 23 products including some fertilizers and pesticides to help lower crop production costs and is working to find more permanent solutions for the farm sector's problems.

Clashes between police and protesters over removal of the barricades resulted in at least one death and scores of injuries and arrests.

Looting was reported in several towns and blocked roads have prevented food getting to market, raising prices for consumers. Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon has accused the FARC rebels of infiltrating the protests and seeking to rope peaceful farmers into their struggle against the government.

"Please, let's not fall into the hands of the violent," said Santos. "Do not allow them to gain strength from these protests because it will distort the entire meaning of the demonstration and it leads to unnecessary confrontations that have led to deaths."

SECOND WAVE

The already grueling life of farming families has become even harder in recent years since income from harvests has failed to cover costs of fertilizers and transportation.

Potato, corn and milk producers complain that free trade agreements with Europe and the United States have made it almost impossible to compete with cheaper imports. Droughts followed by unusually heavy rains have also made farming conditions difficult over the past several years.

The demonstrations, which began on August 19, are the second wave of national strikes this year against agricultural and economic policies which farmers say leave them unable to make any profit.

Even though Santos has made improving the conditions of the poor and cutting the jobless rate a priority, difficulties for farmers are unlikely to change in the coming months.

Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said it would be impossible to meet all demands from the different protest groups.

"The country is on the right track and the economy is an example worldwide," he said on local radio. "But if you add up everything they want there's no way to give them it all. They are seeking significant resources. There isn't enough money to cover the demands of all the sectors."

A Sri Lankan minister on Thursday accused U.N. Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay, assessing the country four years after the end of a brutal civil war, of acting without transparency and said her report will be unfair.

Amid protests for and against a seven-day visit to assess human rights, Pillay visited former northern war zones in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaiteevu and the eastern district of Trincomalee.

Housing Minister Wimal Weerawansa, the leader of the National Freedom Front, a hardline nationalist political party in President Mahinda Rajapaksa's ruling coalition, criticized her itinerary.

"There is a problem on whether she is working with transparency," Weerawansa told reporters in Colombo. "In Trincomalee yesterday, she secretly met some people, who were not in the normal schedule. She is also scheduled to meet some people who are critical of the country. So our view is she is not going to submit a fair report (to the UN)."

Government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said Pillay had freedom to meet whomever she chose during her visit which ended on Wednesday.

Pillay's visit followed a second U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution in March this year that urged Sri Lanka to carry out credible investigations into killings and disappearances during the war, especially in the final stages.

A U.N. panel said earlier it had "credible allegations" that Sri Lankan troops and rebels both carried out atrocities and war crimes, and singled out the government for most of the blame.

The Sri Lanka government battled separatist Tamil guerrillas from 1983 until 2009.

Tens of thousands of civilians were killed in the final months of the war, a U.N. panel said earlier, as government troops advanced on the rebels' last stronghold and many hundreds of people, most of them Tamils, simply disappeared.

Serbia's biggest party threatened its smaller coalition partner on Thursday with a snap election if it keeps up its resistance to painful reforms that the country's new finance minister has vowed to pursue.

The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), the dominant party in the ruling alliance, has taken on the finance portfolio after a cabinet reshuffle in July, setting up a showdown with Prime Minister Ivica Dacic's Socialists over radical spending cuts.

Lawmakers are expected to confirm SNS candidate Lazar Krstic, a 29-year-old Yale graduate and McKinsey consultant, as finance minister this week.

He has pledged to seek a new loan deal with the International Monetary Fund, which will probably require long-resisted cuts in spending on pensioners and state enterprises to curb a budget deficit of at least 4.7 percent of national output and public debt projected at 65 percent by year-end.

Pensioners and public sector employees are Dacic's main constituency.

"If economic measures become a stumbling block ... if any of coalition partners block reforms then we face the most expensive solution - new elections," SNS chief economic strategist Milenko Dzeletovic told the Serbian daily Blic.

"This time the strongest party will not stop," he said. "We need to transform the public sector, attract new investment ... create new jobs."

Pensioners and the public sector account for about one third of the Serbian electorate and half its outgoings.

The IMF has said that without such changes Serbia's budget shortfall will reach eight percent of gross domestic product.

The Fund froze an earlier 1 billion euro ($1.3 billion) standby loan deal early last year over broken spending promises by the previous government. The absence of an IMF safety net has pressured the Serbian dinar and driven up borrowing costs.

Unemployment stands at around 25 percent and bad loans have hit 19.9 percent of total lending. Loss-making state enterprises are a huge drain on state finances.

The country emerged from recession in the first quarter of this year, but growth is fragile.

Riding high in opinion polls, the SNS is confident of winning big in any early election, but is likely to hold off at least until Serbia clinches the start of membership talks with the European Union in January.

The last parliamentary election was in May 2012.

6:20pm EDT

Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) are citing Mitt Romney's dominating performance in his first debate against Barack Obama last year as a model for Sunday's TV clash with Angela Merkel to spice up the last few weeks of a lackluster campaign.

Peer Steinbrueck, the SPD candidate for chancellor, is trailing badly in opinion polls, but his rhetorical gifts could give him an edge over Merkel in their only televised showdown before the September 22 election, and he could be helped by the inclusion of an irreverent entertainer on the question panel.

He has promised to confront her over Greek bailouts, but Steinbrueck will also want to avoid appearing too aggressive in the 1-1/2 hour prime-time clash with Merkel, whose popularity rests in part on her modest, reserved style.

The former finance minister has a quick wit but he can seem arrogant and overbearing. Like U.S. Republican challenger Romney, polls show he suffers from a "likeability" problem.

"I don't need to rehearse," Steinbrueck said on Thursday. "I get the impression that my appearances are more interesting and lively than Frau Merkel's. With me, it rocks."

Ahead of the face-off, Steinbrueck's schoolteacher wife Gertrud has suggested he take deep breaths before launching into critiques of Merkel - advice he has promised to follow.

"An experienced chancellor is going up against a candidate with better rhetorical skills and nothing to lose," said Maybrit Illner, a political talk-show host for public broadcaster ZDF who is one of four moderators for the debate.

"His goal must be to dent her credibility, to insult her in a way that doesn't make him look bad. This is not an easy task."

Adding a twist to the debate is Stefan Raab, one of Germany's most popular entertainers, comedians and musicians, who will join Illner and two other more traditional TV anchors in lobbing questions at the candidates.

The trained butcher and law school dropout is a phenomenon on TV thanks to his cheeky style and outrageous questions, like when he asked a top swimmer if she ever urinated in the pool.

Raab, who came fifth in the 2000 Eurovision song contest with his nonsensical "Wadde hadde dudde da?", could make life uncomfortable for both candidates, but especially Merkel, who is not known for her spontaneity and only reluctantly accepted him as a moderator.

Raab's presence could attract younger viewers, swelling the audience beyond the 14 million who watched the last chancellor debate between Merkel and Frank-Walter Steinmeier in 2009.

ROMNEY PRECEDENT

The duel four years ago was widely panned in the media as a bore, with top-selling Bild newspaper dismissing it with the headline "Yes we gaehn", a play on the Obama campaign slogan, replacing "can" with the German word for "yawn".

Sunday's showdown promises to be more confrontational.

Steinbrueck, 66, is a far feistier character than Steinmeier was. He has accused Merkel of trying to hide the costs of a new Greek bailout from voters.

But he may be wary of trying to play the "peace card" on Syria, as SPD chancellor Gerhard Schroeder did so successfully during his 2002 campaign by staunchly opposing the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

On Wednesday, the chancellor stepped up her rhetoric, vowing that the regime of President Bashar al-Assad could not go unpunished for its apparent use of chemical weapons.

The German electorate has deep pacifist strains and polls show broad opposition to military strikes against Damascus. But Steinbrueck left his options open, saying on Thursday: "With me as chancellor, Germany will always be a reliable partner for our friends on foreign, security and alliance policies."

The two are likely to clash on taxes: Merkel depicts SPD plans to hike levies for top earners as a danger to the economy.

Opinion polls give her conservative bloc, which includes her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), a 15-19 point lead over Steinbrueck's SPD.

That virtually guarantees Merkel will remain chancellor. But it is unclear whether she will get enough votes to continue her coalition with the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP).

Should she fall short, Merkel would probably be forced into difficult talks with the SPD, with whom she ruled before in a "grand coalition" between 2005 and 2009.

So despite a formidable lead, Merkel cannot relax: the debate may be decisive for the shape of the next government.

Although reluctant to liken Steinbrueck to the conservative Romney, the SPD draws hope from the U.S. candidate's strong showing against Obama in the first of their three debates.

An aggressive Romney received a big boost in opinion polls after that clash, in which Obama, normally known for his charisma, seemed listless and distracted.

"I really don't want to make the comparison to Romney," SPD campaign manager Andrea Nahles told a Frankfurt newspaper. "But we are hoping for a similar impact."

What Nahles failed to mention is that Romney, despite his strong debate showing, went on to lose the election.



headline: U.S. transfers two Guantanamo detainees to Algeria

The United States said on Thursday it had transferred two men from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the government of Algeria as part of its ongoing effort to close the controversial prison.

The Pentagon said Nabil Said Hadjarab and Mutia Sadiq Ahmad Sayyab were transferred on Wednesday and arrived in Algeria the same day, leaving 164 detainees at Guantanamo, including 84 others cleared for release years ago.

The two Algerians were detained in Afghanistan more than a decade ago and sent to Guantanamo prison - Hadjarab on January 20, 2002, and Sayyab on February 15, 2002.

The Obama administration first announced plans to repatriate the two inmates last month, resuming the transfer of detainees for the first time in nearly a year.

The Pentagon said the decision to release the two men followed a comprehensive review by an interagency task force which looked at security issues and other factors.

Classified Defense Department files released by the anti-secrecy group Wikileaks said Hadjarab, 34, who was raised in Algeria and France, was believed to be a member of the al Qaeda Global Jihad Support Network with ties to the Algerian Armed Islamic Group.

He traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 where he received AK-47 training in Jalalabad. After the U.S.-led invasion, he fled to the Tora Bora mountains with other al Qaeda supporters. He was wounded by a U.S. helicopter while trying to flee Tora Bora and was later captured by Afghan troops, the U.S. documents said.

Sayyab, 37, also is considered to be a member of the Al Qaeda support network and is thought to have received training in making improvised explosive devices from the Moroccan Armed Islamic Group in Jalalabad, U.S. documents said.

After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States he traveled over the Tora Bora mountains trying to reach Pakistan. He was detained by Pakistani authorities and later handed over to U.S. forces, the documents said.

President Barack Obama has vowed to close the prison at Guantanamo, which has held dozens of prisoners, most without charge, for more than a decade. But the process has dragged on for years.

Obama promised to close the facility during his 2008 presidential campaign, citing its damage to the U.S. reputation around the world, but he has been unable to do so in 4-1/2 years in office, in part because of resistance from Congress.

"Closing Guantanamo remains a priority," said Lieutenant Colonel Todd Breasseale, a Pentagon spokesman. "For this reason, we continue to seek a lifting of the current restrictions that significantly limit our ability to transfer detainees out of Guantanamo, even those who have already been designated for transfer."

Breasseale said Wednesday's transfers were possible because the two men were among the few detainees going to a country that was not specifically barred by legislative restrictions and Algeria was willing to provide the security and humane treatment assurances required by the United States.

The Guantanamo prison camp was established during the presidency of George W. Bush to house foreign terrorism suspects after the September 11, 2001, attack on the United States.

A hunger strike and daily feeding of dozens of inmates through a tube inserted through the nose into the stomach has fueled calls to shut the detention center.

Last month lawmakers blasted the prison's cost, about $2.7 million per prisoner per year, compared with $70,000 per inmate at maximum-security federal prisons.

The last prisoner transferred out of Guantanamo was Omar Khadr, the youngest inmate and last Westerner held at the base. He was sent in September to finish his sentence in his native Canada.



headline: Two civilians killed in shelling near Rwanda-Congo border

Two people were killed when an artillery shell crashed close to a Rwandan market near the border with Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, residents in the Rwandan frontier town of Gisenyi said.

A Rwandan official confirmed the deaths and said a second shell had landed inside Rwanda near a border crossing, seriously wounding one person.

Last week, a 3,000-strong U.N. intervention brigade with a mandate to neutralize armed groups launched an operation in eastern Congo against a rebel group widely believed to be backed by Rwanda.

"The bomb killed two people, a woman and a baby," witness Nizeyimana Hamis told Reuters by telephone.

The Rwandan official who spoke on condition of anonymity accused the Congolese army of firing the shells. Rwanda denies backing the so-called M23 rebellion but fears are growing the violence inside Congo could spill across borders.

A diplomat in the Great Lakes region told Reuters it was clear the rebels had received support from Rwanda to help counter the U.N. force's aerial and ground assault over the past week.



headline: Russia sends warships to Mediterranean as Syria tension rises
byline: By Timothy Heritage
6:20pm EDT

Russia is sending two warships to the east Mediterranean, Interfax news agency said on Thursday, but Moscow denied this meant it was beefing up its naval force there as Western powers prepare for military action against Syria.

Interfax quoted a source in the armed forces' general staff as saying Russia, Syria's most powerful ally, was deploying a missile cruiser from the Black Sea Fleet and a large anti-submarine ship from the Northern Fleet in the "coming days".

Any strengthening of the navy's presence could fuel tension, especially as the United States has said it is repositioning naval forces in the Mediterranean following an alleged chemical weapons attack which is blames on Syrian government forces.

"The well-known situation now in the eastern Mediterranean required us to make some adjustments to the naval force," the source said in a reference to the events in Syria.

It was not clear when the vessels would arrive but Interfax said the Moskva missile cruiser was currently in the North Atlantic and would set sail in the next few days.

President Vladimir Putin has said the naval presence is needed to protect national security interests and is not a threat to any nation. Russia cooperates with NATO navies against piracy and its ships call at Western ports.

The navy later indicated a deployment was imminent in the Mediterranean but gave no details except to say it would be part of a long-planned rotation and suggested it would not increase the size of Russian forces there.

"This is not a new group ... but a planned rotation," an highly-placed navy official who was not identified told state-run RIA news agency.

The reason for the discrepancy in the reports by Interfax and RIA was not clear but confusion has at times surrounded previous Russian deployments in the Mediterranean because of the secrecy involved. The Defence Ministry declined comment.

Washington accuses Syrian government forces of carrying out last week's chemical weapons attack and has made clear it could soon launch a military strike.

Russia is one of Assad's biggest arms suppliers. It opposes any military intervention in Syria and has shielded Damascus against further sanctions at the U.N. Security Council.

Defense experts said the deployment of the two warships identified by Interfax could give Assad early warning of cruise missile launches, particularly by submarine, or jam radars or navigation systems although they might never be used for this.

"What we may be seeing here is an example of gunboat diplomacy rather than a deliberate attempt to interfere directly in any coalition strike militarily," said Lee Willett, editor of IHS Jane's Navy International.

"The simple presence of any ships will have an impact politically, and that is the primary intent."

Russia's chief of staff said in June the navy had stationed 16 warships and three ship-based helicopters in the Mediterranean, its first permanent naval deployment there since Soviet times.



headline: Colombia's high court rules FARC peace talks law constitutional
byline: By Helen Murphy
6:20pm EDT

A Colombian high court ruled on Wednesday that a law that made peace talks possible with Marxist FARC rebels is constitutional, rejecting a legal challenge that could have jeopardized efforts to end five decades of war.

The so-called Legal Framework for Peace, approved in Congress last year, modified the constitution and laid the foundation for punishment of war crimes, reparations for victims and eventual peace with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

"The Constitutional Court considered that to reach stable and lasting peace, it is legitimate to adopt transitional justice measures like the mechanisms of selection and ranking," of crimes, said a statement read by the court's top judge, Jorge Ivan Palacio.

The court's decision came on the same evening President Juan Manuel Santos announced that his government was ready to prepare for peace negotiations with the FARC's smaller counterpart, the National Liberation Army, or ELN.

That decision had been expected after the ELN met Santos' pre-condition for talks, the freeing on Tuesday of a Canadian hostage the group had held for seven months.

Though a pre-requisite for talks with the rebel movements, the reform has been harshly criticized by the opposition and human rights groups as an inadequate law that offers a "backdoor amnesty" for horrific war crimes and one that may force victims to turn to the international courts for redress.

Gustavo Gallon, a lawyer with the Colombian Commission of Jurists, had filed the legal challenge to three phrases in the text of the law that he said would allow lawmakers to select which cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and other war crimes could be investigated and punished, leading to impunity for many.

Supporters of the reform had argued that any change to its wording could weaken the scope of the entire law, throwing into doubt negotiations in Cuba between the rebels and the government.

PEACE VS JUSTICE

The law became the foundation that drew the FARC, Latin America's biggest rebel group, into peace talks late last year. The bloody conflict has killed at least 200,000 people.

Only members of the FARC and the ELN stand to benefit from the law. It excludes criminals involved with drug cartels or former paramilitary groups.

The FARC first took up arms in 1964 as a Marxist group struggling against inequality, but later turned to kidnapping and drug-trafficking to finance itself. Colombia is a leading producer of cocaine.

President Santos argues that it is unrealistic to attempt to investigate and punish all violations and war crimes during the conflict and called the court's ruling an important step towards ending decades of violence.

"For this process to be successful depends in large part on the justice system and that we find the middle point between justice and peace that enables us to put a definitive end to this conflict which has been bleeding us for 50 years," he said.

Opposition leaders, however, argue that the law would allow rebels responsible for atrocious war crimes to benefit from soft prison sentences or walk away scot-free. Former President Alvaro Uribe says it violates certain international treaties because it would effectively pardon crimes against humanity.

Even as the 8,000-strong FARC has been weakened by a decade-long U.S.-backed offensive, a rash of attacks against oil installations as well as recent heavy military combat losses against the rebel group, have proven it is still a force to be reckoned with.

The two sides reached partial agreement in Havana on rural development, the first issue on a five-point agenda, and are now negotiating terms of how the rebels will be incorporated into the political system. They also will seek agreement on the drug trade, reparation of victims and an end to the conflict.

down for Britain's leader after coming under fierce domestic and international pressure.

Just a day after recalling Britain's parliament to vote on how to respond to Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons, Cameron was ambushed when the opposition Labour party said it wanted greater parliamentary scrutiny and rebel lawmakers in his own ruling Conservative party said they would oppose him.

Earlier on Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had sought more time for inspectors to complete their work, Russia had said it was premature to table a U.N. resolution, and the Labour party had made it clear it wanted clear proof that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons.

Cameron's failure to execute his original plan of action could hamper efforts by the United States to deliver a swift cruise missile strike against Syria as early as this week, potentially harming London's alliance with Washington.

Inspired by the legacy of public mistrust left behind by former Prime Minister Tony Blair's contested decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003, Labour leader Ed Miliband and some rebel Conservatives used the prospect of a government defeat in parliament to force Cameron to delay action.

After hours of impromptu negotiations between Cameron's political managers and the opposition, his office agreed that the United Nations Security Council should see findings from chemical weapons inspectors before it responded militarily.

"The United Nations Security Council must have the opportunity immediately to consider that briefing (from inspectors) and ... every effort should be made to secure a Security Council Resolution backing military action before any such action is taken," a British government motion to be debated in parliament on Thursday said.

Britain had previously declined to say it would wait for a U.N. report before launching military action.

But on Wednesday it promised parliament would be given a second vote before Britain committed to direct military action, rather than the single vote - on Thursday - it had initially promised.

"A watered-down motion is better than a defeat for the government," said Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative lawmaker who opposed immediate military action, told the BBC.

"The motion ... will not allow military action. We need hard evidence" to sanction military action.

NATIONAL SECURITY UNDER THREAT

Cameron had said earlier that Britain would put a draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council condemning the suspected chemical weapons attacks by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and authorizing "necessary measures".

Britain's National Security Council had also unanimously backed action.

An amendment to the government's parliamentary motion tabled by the Labour Party said it would support military action only if members of the U.N. Security Council saw the inspectors' report first, among other conditions.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague had earlier said Britain's national security would be undermined if it failed to challenge the Syrian government over the use of chemical weapons against its own people.

Hague said it was the first time that chemical warfare has been used anywhere in the world in the 21st century, saying that efforts to bring Syria to book through the United Nations had failed. "We cannot allow diplomatic paralysis to be a shield for the perpetrators of these crimes," he wrote.

But by Wednesday evening his tone had changed.

"The motion that we're putting forward tomorrow reflects the Prime Minister's recognition of the deep concerns in this country about what happened over Iraq," he said in a statement.

"We will be clear that we are determined to take action against war crimes, against crimes against humanity - and that is what the use of chemical weapons constitutes - but that we will also proceed as far as possible on a consensual basis."

Lawmakers will still debate Britain's response to the chemical attack in Syria on Thursday after Cameron cut short his holiday, recalled parliament, and rushed back to London to chair a meeting of the National Security Council.

Public support for action is fragile. A YouGov poll published showed 50 percent of the British public opposed a missile strike on Syria, with just 25 percent in favor of it.



headline: Rwanda blocks proposed U.N. sanctions for two Congo rebels
byline: By Louis Charbonneau
6:20pm EDT

French proposal to impose U.N. sanctions on two senior commanders in the M23 rebel group in eastern Congo, arguing that the evidence against the men was weak, Rwandan and other U.N. envoys said on Wednesday.

The latest diplomatic wrangling in New York came as U.N. helicopters and artillery attacked M23 rebel positions near the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday in support of an offensive by the Congolese armed forces. One U.N. peacekeeper from Tanzania was killed and three other blue-helmeted troops were wounded.

The United States and France submitted documents to the U.N. Security Council's Congo sanctions committee last week explaining why M23's Colonel Vianney Kazarama, military spokesman for the rebel group, and Erick Mboneza, an M23 commander, should be hit with U.N. sanctions.

old man he said was a thief.

The documents also refer to a U.N. Group of Experts report that says Mboneza and an M23 Colonel Kaina, who is already subject to a U.N. travel ban and asset freeze for his activities in the rebel group, were seen meeting with Rwandan military officers between March and May 2013.

The Group of Experts has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting M23, an allegation Kigali vehemently rejects. The cross-border accusations underscore the M23 rebellion's roots in a complex web of local politics and regional conflicts over ethnicity, land and minerals.

Rwanda's deputy U.N. ambassador, Olivier Nduhungirehe, told Reuters that Kigali blocked the proposed blacklisting because it would have undermined regional efforts to bring peace to eastern Congo and Kampala talks between M23 and Congo's government.

He added that the evidence supporting the U.S.-French proposal was "very poor."

Diplomats said Rwanda, a temporary council member, was the only one of the 15 member nations that opposed the idea of blacklisting the two men.

The Security Council's sanctions committee works on the basis of consensus, which means Rwanda was able to singlehandedly block the proposed blacklisting.

In theory, council members could vote on the blacklistings in a Security Council resolution that Rwanda would be unable to block. It was not clear if the council was prepared to do that.

'DEEPLY REGRETTABLE'

Separately, Rwanda has repeatedly rejected council efforts to issue a public statement condemning M23 attacks on U.N. peacekeepers last week, U.N. diplomats said. Rwanda complained that the Western-drafted statement was unbalanced and unfairly targeted the M23 while ignoring attacks by the Congolese army.

Kigali initially criticized the statement for not mentioning shelling onto Rwandan territory last week, though later drafts, all seen by Reuters, did ask for the council condemn the firing into Rwanda.

A new draft of the statement was rejected by Rwanda on Wednesday. A Rwandan delegate said in an email to other Security Council members that it could not support some of the language in the latest draft text.

One council delegation responded to the Rwandan rejection by saying , "It would be the first time when attacks on U.N. peacekeepers are not condemned by the Security Council. This situation is deeply regrettable," according to a copy of the email, seen by Reuters.

But Nduhungirehe said negotiations on a statement were continuing. "We are now close to an agreement," he said.

A 3,000-strong U.N. intervention brigade, with a tough new mandate to protect civilians and neutralize armed groups in the mineral-rich central African nation, sprang into action last week after it accused the M23 rebels of shelling Goma. The violence has been escalating there in recent days.



headline: Panama says Cuban weapons shipment 'without doubt' violated U.N. sanctions
byline: By Lomi Kriel
6:20pm EDT

Cuban weapons seized aboard a North Korean ship in Panamanian waters last month are "without doubt" a violation of United Nations sanctions against arms transfers to Pyongyang, Panama said Wednesday, citing a U.N. report.

Panamanian authorities say they were given a preliminary report, presented by a panel of experts to the Sanctions Committee at the U.N. Security Council, according to a statement by Panama's Ministry of Security.

"According to the first report presented by the panel of experts from the U.N. Sanctions Committee, the Cuban weapons found in the North Korean ship 'without doubt' violate the U.N. sanctions, which validates Panama's position on how it acted," the ministry said, citing the report.

"The Panel (of Experts) confirmed the Panamanian evaluation that there is a violation of the sanctions regime," a Security Council diplomat told Reuters.

Panamanian officials did not release the preliminary report prepared by the panel, which is an independent body tasked with reporting to the U.N. Security Council.

"There are still questions about the Cuban angle in all of this," another Security Council diplomat said, adding that it "will take time" to clarify the incident.

Panamanian investigators detained the Chong Chon Gang last month near the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal because they suspected it was carrying drugs. Weapons were found under 10,000 tons of Cuban sugar in sacks.

The panel's findings echo a similar report released Tuesday by a U.S. think tank that concluded the shipment not only breached U.N. sanctions, but was likely meant for Pyongyang's use, and not destined for Havana as Cuban officials maintained.

A team of six U.N. weapons experts has been in Panama investigating whether the weapons violate a 7-year-old U.N. ban on arms transfers to North Korea because of its nuclear weapons and missile development.

After the weapons were discovered, Cuba acknowledged it was sending 240 tons of "obsolete" Soviet-era weapons, including two MiG jets, 15 MiG engines and nine anti-aircraft missiles, to be repaired in North Korea and returned to Cuba.

Cuban officials told Panama the cargo was a donation of sugar for the people of North Korea, according to a senior Panamanian official.

North Korean diplomats, meeting with Panamanian officials Wednesday, declined to comment on the report's findings.

"We're here to give consular access to our crew, nothing more," said Ri Il Gyn, one of two officials visiting from North Korea's Embassy in Havana.

Panamanian Security Minister Jose Raul Mulino said the reports justify the Central American country's actions in detaining the Chong Chon Gang and its 35 sailors.

The Cuban weapons shipment, hidden in "deliberately modified" sections of the vessel, appears to be much larger than Havana acknowledged, according to the analysis by 38 North, a website run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Maryland.

The 38 North analysts based their findings on photographs and reports from Panamanian authorities and the United Nations Organization on Drugs and Crime Container Control Program.

The 38 North report also said various rocket-propelled grenades and conventional artillery were in "mint condition," and in their original packaging.

"These items were intended simply for delivery to North Korea for its own use," said the report, co-authored by Hugh Griffiths, a global arms trafficking expert with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden.

Most significant was the packaging of the MiG-21 jet engines, which were carefully stored under protective plastic sheeting. The MiG fuselages, the report said, had no padding and were "rather carelessly packed" in metal containers.

That suggests the engines were intended to be used as replacements in North Korea, and not repaired and returned to Cuba, while the fuselages were likely meant as spare parts, the report by 38 North said.

Mig-21 aircraft are "obsolete by Western standards," but they are as fast as the KF-16, South Korea's main fighter fleet. Allied forces would still have an edge, but expanding North Korea's MiG-21 collection would help Pyongyang's "survivability," the 38 North report said.

Wednesday's meeting between Panamanian officials and North Korean diplomats centered around the future of the crew and ship, which is still detained in the Atlantic port of Manzanillo.

Panamanian officials said they would return the ship to its registered owner as soon as North Korea repairs the vessel's power supply. The crew sabotaged the ship's electrical system and bilge pumps after Panamanian investigators boarded the ship.

The crew are in a former U.S. Army base, charged with threatening Panama's security by trying to ship undeclared weapons through the canal. A Panamanian official told Reuters they would likely be returned to North Korea within a month.

The sugar, meanwhile, remains in large government vats in a rural area in central Panama. Government officials have said they are analyzing to see whether they can sell it to a company interested in turning it into ethanol.



headline: Colombia president says government ready for peace talks with ELN rebels
byline: By Helen Murphy and Peter Murphy
6:20pm EDT

Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos on Wednesday said he is ready to start peace talks with the smaller of two leftist rebel groups, the National Liberation Army, in an effort to end half a century of war in the Andean nation.

Santos' decision to engage in dialogue with the guerrilla group, known as the ELN, came after it freed a Canadian geologist this week after holding him hostage for seven months.

The ELN, which has about 3,000 combatants, has been fighting the government since 1964 when radical Catholic priests inspired by the Cuban revolution took up arms in a bid to overthrow the government.

Santos already opened peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in November and though they have been turbulent at times and progressed slowly, neither side has walked away from the negotiating table.

"Hopefully we can work out the necessary procedures to start dialogue with the ELN to see if once and for all we can put an end to this conflict with the two groups involved in it," Santos said at the presidential palace.

Both groups are considered terrorist organizations by the United States and European Union.

Santos' bid to draw ELN rebels into negotiations was widely expected and the group's leaders have for months expressed interest in starting dialogue similar to that of the FARC.

While Colombians will welcome Santos' effort to bring an end to conflict in Colombia, many analysts believe it will be difficult to get talks off the ground before campaigning begins for next year's presidential election. Santos must make a decision on whether to run for a second term by November.

Talks with the FARC have already dragged on for 10 months with only partial agreement on one item on a five-point agenda.

The scion of one of the nation's wealthiest families, Santos took a political gamble when he opened peace talks with the FARC in late 2012. The rebel group has taken advantage of previous peace talks to rebuild and return to the battlefield revitalized.

The ELN has sought peace before, holding talks in Cuba and Venezuela between 2002 and 2007. Experts say there was a lack of will on both sides to agree on a final peace plan.

But this time, a 10-year military offensive, backed by U.S. funds has weakened both rebel groups, cutting their numbers and damaging their lines of communication, which may have left them more amenable to negotiating a peace agreement.

Peace with the ELN and FARC - which have both made doing business in Colombia risky - would cement huge security gains over the last decade and help attract more investment to the $330 billion economy.

Colombia, a nation of 47 million, has attracted record foreign direct investment in recent years as troops push the guerrilla groups deeper into the thick jungles.

While oil and mining companies have been able to work in more remote and dangerous areas in recent years, the risk to employees continues. Both the ELN and FARC have stepped up attacks on the infrastructure this year, hitting oil pipelines and power lines repeatedly.

President Barack Obama vowed on Wednesday that the Syrian government would face "international consequences" for last week's deadly chemical attack, but made clear any military response would be limited to avoid dragging the United States into another war in the Middle East.

Casting the need for action based on U.S. national security interests instead of humanitarian grounds, Obama made his case to a war-weary American public for what is looking like an all-but-certain use of force in Syria, where he has long been reluctant to intervene.

While saying he and allied leaders had not yet made a decision on military strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's loyalists, he left little doubt that the choice was not whether to act but when.

"We have concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out, and if that's so, then there need to be international consequences," Obama told "PBS Newshour" in a televised interview.

There were growing signs, however, that the timeline for launching any military strike on Syria could be complicated not only by the U.N. weapons inspectors' continued presence there but by the Obama administration's efforts to coordinate with international partners and growing demands for consultation with U.S. lawmakers.

On top of that, Britain - a key player in any air assault on Syria - changed its stance on Wednesday, saying the U.N. Security Council should see findings from weapons inspectors before any military action is taken and that the British parliament should vote on the matter twice.

For his part, Obama insisted that while Assad's government must be punished, he intended to avoid repeating Washington's errors from the Iraq war.

"I have no interest in any open-ended conflict in Syria, but we do have to make sure that when countries break international norms on weapons like chemical weapons that could threaten us, that they are held accountable," Obama said.

It was Obama's clearest justification yet for a tough response against Assad, who is accused of having crossed a "red line" for large-scale chemical weapons use that Obama established just over a year ago. Hundreds of people were killed in a poison gas attack on Damascus suburb last Wednesday.

SYRIANS PREPARE FOR ATTACK

In Damascus on Wednesday, people left homes close to potential targets as U.S. officials sketched out plans for multi-national air strikes on Syria that could last for days. U.N. chemical weapons experts completed a second field trip to rebel-held suburbs searching for evidence.

But as U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon appealed for unity among world powers and sought more time for the inspectors to complete their work, Washington and its European and Middle East allies said their minds were made up and that Assad must face retribution for using banned weapons against his people.

Syria's government, supported notably by its main arms supplier Russia, cried foul. It blamed rebel "terrorists" for releasing the toxins with the help of the United States, Britain and France, and warned it would be a "graveyard of invaders."

Syrian officials say the West is playing into the hands of its al Qaeda enemies. The presence of Islamist militants among the rebels has deterred Western powers from arming Assad's foes. But the West says it must now act to stop the use of poison gas.

Britain pushed the other four veto-holding members of the U.N. Security Council at a meeting in New York to authorize military action against Assad to protect Syrian civilians - a move certain to be blocked by Russia and, probably, China. The meeting ended without a decision.

The United States and its allies say a U.N. veto will not stop them. Western diplomats called the proposed resolution a maneuver to isolate Moscow and rally a coalition behind air strikes. Arab states, NATO and Turkey also condemned Assad.

But British Prime Minister David Cameron was forced on Wednesday to push back his timetable after coming under fierce domestic and international pressure, and it was unclear how that might affect any Syria attack plans.

Just a day after recalling Britain's parliament to vote on how to respond to Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons, Cameron was ambushed when the opposition Labour party said it wanted greater parliamentary scrutiny and rebel lawmakers in his own ruling Conservative Party said they would oppose him.

Syria asked the United Nations on Wednesday to order chemical experts in Damascus to investigate three rebel attacks in which he said Syrian troops "inhaled poisonous gas," while Britain pushed for the Security Council to act on the crisis.

The United States dismissed the appeal by Syria's U.N. envoy, saying it had refused chemical experts access to Syria to investigate allegations poisonous gas had been used repeatedly in the country's 2-1/2-year-old civil war.

The United Nations has received at least 14 reports of possible chemical weapons use in Syria. After months of diplomatic wrangling, a team of experts, led by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom, arrived in Syria on August 18.

The U.N. team was initially going to look into three incidents, but its priority became investigating an alleged gas attack in the rebel-held suburbs of Damascus last week, which activists say killed hundreds of civilians.

Assad's government denies responsibility for the attack, and, like Russia, has suggested the rebels may be responsible.

Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari said he has written to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to ask that Sellstrom's team also "investigate three heinous incidents that took place in the countryside of Damascus on (August) 22nd, 24th and 25th where members of the Syrian army inhaled poisonous gas."

The U.N. investigators are due to leave Syria this weekend and U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters that the world body had not asked the Syrian government for an extension to the 14-day visit.

"The team has the ability to investigate other incidents as needed," Haq said, adding that the initial three incidents they were due to examine when they arrived in Syria would be investigated "in due course."

Western powers are planning possible military action in Syria in order to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, who they blame for last week's attack.

"The Americans want to go quickly," said a western diplomat.

NO HIDING

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was asked by reporters in Washington if she thought the call for a new U.N. investigation was intended to stall for time to delay an attack. U.N. diplomats say any Western airstrikes on Syria are unlikely while the chemical experts are in the country.

"I don't want to venture to guess why they're doing what they're doing, but I think it's clear that we will not allow them to hide behind a U.N. investigation into the use of chemical weapons to prevent any response from the United States," Harf said.

The Syrian government and the opposition have accused each other of using chemical weapons, and both have denied doing so. The U.N. inquiry is trying to establish only whether chemical weapons were used, not who used them.

Ja'afari's request to Ban on Wednesday came as the five permanent veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council - Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France - met to discuss a British draft resolution that would condemn Assad's government for carrying out the attack last week.

The draft resolution would authorize "all necessary force" to protect civilians from chemical weapons - giving approval for military action in Syria by western powers.

The meeting of the five Security Council members lasted about an hour and all of the envoys declined to comment afterward. Moscow said earlier that Britain was "premature" in seeking a resolution to protect Syrian civilians.

Russia, Syria's main arms supplier, as well as China, have already vetoed three resolutions condemning Assad.

U.N. diplomats said the Security Council may not even vote on the resolution since Russia has made clear it opposes any military intervention in Syria. Harf said Washington saw no point in waiting for U.N. Security Council action given Moscow's position on Syria.

"We cannot be held up in responding by Russia's ... continued intransigence at the United Nations," Harf said. "Quite frankly, the situation is so serious that it demands a response."



headline: U.N. peacekeeper killed in Congo fighting; three others wounded

6:20pm EDT

A U.N. peacekeeper from Tanzania was killed and three others were wounded on Wednesday in an operation with the Congolese army to drive back M23 rebels from the city of Goma in eastern Congo, a U.N spokesman said.

Democratic Republic of Congo's U.N. peacekeeping mission used helicopters, artillery and ground troops in support of government forces that launched the assault on rebel positions north of Goma, a city of 1 million people on the Rwandan border.

A 3,000-strong U.N. intervention brigade, with a tough new mandate to protect civilians and neutralize armed groups in the mineral-rich central African nation, sprang into action last week after the United Nations accused the rebels of shelling the city.

The M23 rebels, aware that their presence within striking distance of Goma is key to their leverage in stalled peace talks, have fiercely resisted Congolese army efforts to push them back.

Wednesday's fighting focused on the high ground around the village of Kibati, 11 km (7 miles) north of Goma.

"The M23 has been using these positions to shell populated areas. The objective of the operation is therefore to remove the threat against Goma," U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said.

Congo's U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as MONUSCO, later said that the dead peacekeeper was a Tanzanian.

A U.N. official in Goma said Indian peacekeepers and members of the intervention brigade - composed of Tanzanian, South African and Malawian troops - had taken part in the fighting.

South African military spokesman Brigadier General Xolani Mabanga said two of the wounded soldiers were South African.

The nationality of the third person wounded in the attack was not yet known.

A Congolese officer at the frontline said government troops had by early evening seized strategic hills in Kibati and were fending off attempts to retake them.

BORDER TENSIONS

MONUSCO's top military official said that at least one, and possibly two shells fell inside Goma late on Wednesday.

old boy was killed and others injured in one of the blasts.

Mortar bombs and rockets have struck both sides of Congo's border with Rwanda in the past week, raising tensions between two neighbors which have fought two wars since the 1990s.

Kigali has accused Congo's army of firing on its territory, and Rwandan army spokesman Brigadier General Joseph Nzabamwita said mortar bombs had rained down on Rwanda "the whole day".

At least seven civilians were killed by shells that landed in Goma on Thursday and Saturday, humanitarian agencies and witnesses said.

Congo has blamed M23 for firing into Rwanda to try to draw in Kigali, which U.N. investigators accused of supporting the 18-month rebellion - a charge Rwanda has denied.

M23 humiliated Congo's army and the 17,000-strong MONUSCO force by briefly occupying Goma in November, forcing the government to accept peace talks.

The new U.N. intervention brigade was created in March, marking an aggressive step-up for peacekeeping operations in the region, which for years have been criticized for inaction.

Bolstered by the new brigade, Congolese President Joseph Kabila has effectively ditched the peace talks in the Ugandan capital Kampala, analysts say.

But MONUSCO chief Martin Kobler said protecting eastern Congo's largest city was the government's responsibility.

"The U.N. cannot guarantee the security of Goma. It's our partners the (Congolese army) who will do that," he said.

headline: U.S. rejects link between North Korea nuclear diplomacy, jailed American

stalled talks over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons, the State Department said on Wednesday.

Robert King, U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, is slated to travel to Pyongyang on Friday. The State Department on Tuesday described his trip as a "humanitarian mission" aimed at winning the release of ailing Kenneth Bae, a Christian missionary and tour operator.

The release of Bae, sentenced by North Korea's Supreme Court in April to 15 years of hard labor for state subversion, would remove a big irritant in U.S. relations with Pyongyang.

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said, however, that King's trip is unrelated to international diplomacy over North Korea, which has conducted three nuclear weapons tests since 2006.

"I don't want to link the two in any way," she told reporters.

"We have repeatedly said that separate and apart from any of the other issues we talk about with North Korea that Kenneth Bae needs to be released immediately," added Harf.

Harf reiterated Washington's position that it expects North Korea to live up to a denuclearization-for-aid deal it signed in 2005 at six-party talks in Beijing.

Those talks involving China, Japan, the two Koreas and the United States have been frozen for nearly five years, during which time North Korea conducted three nuclear tests and a series of long-range missile launches that prompted stiff U.N. sanctions.

"We will continue to hold (North Korea) to those commitments and its international obligations," said Harf.

"The onus is on North Korea here," she said.

North Korea said in July it would not give up its nuclear deterrent until Washington ends its "hostile policy" towards Pyongyang, although it was ready to revive nuclear talks. The two countries do not have diplomatic relations and official visits between them are rare.

Bae, 45, was detained in November as he led a tour group through the northern region of the North Korea. The court that sentenced him said he used his tourism business to form groups aimed at overthrowing the government.

FAMILY PRAYS FOR RELEASE

Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told Reuters on August 10 that her brother was moved from a prison labor farm to a state hospital because he suffered from a range of health problems, including an enlarged heart and chronic diabetes.

Asked about King's trip, Chung said on Wednesday: "We are hoping and praying for Kenneth's release, but we are declining interviews at this time due to the uncertainty and sensitivity of the situation."

The foreign ministry of Sweden, which handles U.S. interests in Pyongyang, said it understood Bae was still in the hospital, where Swedish diplomats had last visited him on August 9.

Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has traveled to North Korea to retrieve detained Americans, said he was optimistic for Bae because it was unlikely King "would be going unless it looked good."

Previous trips, including those by former U.S. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, as well as his own visits, involved "outsiders and not official representatives," Richardson told Reuters by telephone.

"This time it's an official representative, which is a good sign," he said. "Hopefully it will mean that the North Koreans will say something positive about resuming the dialogue, which I believe is very much needed." he said.



headline: Panama says Cuban weapons shipment 'without doubt' violated U.N. sanctions

Cuban weapons seized aboard a North Korean ship in Panamanian waters last month are "without doubt" a violation of United Nations sanctions against arms transfers to Pyongyang, Panama said Wednesday, citing a U.N. report.

Panamanian authorities say they were given a preliminary report presented by a panel of experts to the Sanctions Committee at the U.N. Security Council, according to a statement by Panama's Ministry of Security.

"According to the first report presented by the panel of experts from the U.N. sanctions committee, the Cuban weapons found in the North Korean ship 'without doubt' violate the U.N. sanctions, which validates Panama's position on how it acted," the ministry said, citing the report.

Panamanian investigators detained the Chong Chon Gang last month near the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal after receiving a tip it was carrying drugs. Weapons were found under 10,000 tons of Cuban sugar.

The U.N. findings echo a similar report released Tuesday by a U.S. think tank concluding the shipment not only breached U.N. sanctions, but was likely meant for Pyongyang's use, and not destined for Havana as Cuban officials maintained.

A team of six U.N. Security Council experts has been in Panama investigating whether the weapons violate a 7-year-old U.N. ban on arms transfers to North Korea because of its nuclear weapons and missile development.

The panel of experts is an independent body tasked with reporting to the U.N. Security Council and U.N. officials cannot comment on its ongoing investigation.

After the weapons were discovered, Cuba acknowledged it was sending 240 tons of "obsolete" Soviet-era weapons, including two MiG jets, 15 MiG engines and nine anti-aircraft missiles, to be repaired in North Korea and returned to Cuba.

Cuban officials told Panama the cargo was a donation of sugar for the people of North Korea, according to a senior Panamanian official.



headline: U.S. intelligence committees say they're not properly consulted on Syria
byline: By Mark Hosenball and Patricia Zengerle
6:20pm EDT

U.S. congressional intelligence committee leaders believe the Obama administration has not properly consulted them as the president engages in final deliberations for possible military action in Syria, according to congressional officials.

One of the officials said the administration's discussions with critical lawmakers, including Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein and her House counterpart, Mike Rogers, had been limited to "very brief status updates."

Another official said such talks had largely taken place over unclassified non-secure phone lines, making it difficult to discuss sensitive intelligence findings or details of the administration's plans for a possible U.S. military response.

Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said in a statement on Wednesday that President Barack Obama continued to review options regarding Syria. She also said administration officials were reaching out to congressional leaders from each party, and other members of Congress.

A number of U.S. lawmakers have complained in recent days that Obama must do more to involve Congress in any decision to punish Syria militarily in response to last week's chemical weapons attack on thousands of civilians.

John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, sent a letter to Obama on Wednesday asking him "to clearly articulate" to the public and Congress his objectives, policy and strategy for Syria.

"I have conferred with the chairmen of the national security committees who have received initial outreach from senior Administration officials, and while the outreach has been appreciated, it is apparent from the questions above that the outreach has, to date, not reached the level of substantive consultation," Boehner wrote.

Many lawmakers have been careful to add they generally support decisive action against Syria President Bashar al-Assad.

Secretary of State John Kerry delivered an impassioned statement on Monday laying out the case for punishing the Assad government after he said evidence showed that the use of chemical weapons in Syria was "undeniable." He also said the Syrian government had maintained custody of the weapons and had the rockets capable of delivering them.

But the administration as of midday on Wednesday had yet to share a U.S. intelligence report that may directly link the Assad government to last week's attack. A senior administration official said on Wednesday a formal assessment was expected this week and a classified version would be shared with Congress.

Although the White House said Obama had yet to make a final decision on how to respond, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday the administration was considering military options that include multi-day strikes on Syrian government targets.

The international talks on how to respond to Syria come as the House and Senate are away from Washington for their five-week August recess. They are not due back until September 9.

So far, there has not been serious talk about calling lawmakers back from recess.

AUTHORITY TO ACT

Obama has broad legal powers to undertake military action against Syria. Under the 1973 U.S. War Powers Act, the president must notify Congress within 48 hours of launching military action. But forces can fight for 60 days before Congress has to approve any action.

Despite that latitude, a growing number of lawmakers say they should have a say before any strikes occur.

Republican Representative Scott Rigell, asked all 435 members of the House of Representatives to sign a letter to Obama demanding that he consult with Congress and offering to come back early from their August recess to debate the situation in Syria.

A spokeswoman for Rigell said 116 House members - 98 Republicans and 18 Democrats - had signed the letter.

Other lawmakers, especially Republicans, have been even more forthright with their reluctance to support military action.

Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement on Wednesday raising questions about how the United States would pay for any intervention.

"Today I told the Administration that I cannot support military action in Syria unless the President presents to Congress his broader strategy in the region that addresses our national security interests and the budget to support it," Inhofe said.

Some Democrats say the United States does not have a good recent track history of achieving its foreign policy goals through military might.

"I'm not sure how we look at the conduct of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and believe that we're going to be successful at pulling the strings of Syrian politics through military intervention," Democratic Senator Christopher Murphy told Reuters in a telephone interview on Wednesday.



headline: Britain pushes back Syria chemical attack response timetable
headline: Asylum seekers threaten to sink Australian government in election
byline: By Rob Taylor
6:20pm EDT

Australian Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare crouches uncomfortably in a suit on the canvas of a youth boxing ring in Sydney's hardscrabble Western Suburbs, shaping up for the election fight of his life.

Clare, in charge of a border circling 12 million square kilometers of ocean, has the unenviable job of stopping thousands of asylum seekers arriving by boat in Australia, an issue threatening to bring down Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's Labor government at elections just two weeks away.

"People are drowning to get here. It opens up old scars. People say 'please stop more people drowning'," says the campaigning Clare, whose wife is from a Vietnamese family who risked their lives to reach Australia following the 1975 fall of Saigon.

Clare grew up in the Western Suburbs, far away from Sydney's glittering harbor and affluent eastern beachsides, in an area long thought to be a centre-left Labor heartland of blue-collar jobs and traditional manufacturing.

But his humanitarian reasoning does not go far in explaining why Rudd's minority government is struggling here to avert a September 7 poll rout, with surveys tipping the loss of six election-turning seats, some held for 70 years.

In this traffic-choked home to two million, a crucible of Australian multiculturalism where many are new migrants, soaring living costs, groaning infrastructure and disappearing jobs have badly hurt Labor, along with crime and drive-by shootings helping to fuel feelings of insecurity.

And as voters lose faith in Rudd's pledge to improve lives through better transport, health and education, they have also grown resentful of new boat people seen as potential security threats, immigration queue jumpers and rivals for jobs.

"The issue plays out in every single possible way. Rumors go around about them getting $50,000 for a car, or welfare, or whatever. The refugees are an easy people to blame," says local Labor MP Julie Owens.

POLITICAL THORN

Immigration has been a political thorn in Australia since its colonial settlement, but more so since the post-World War Two arrival of more than 100,000 non-English speaking Europeans under a government strategy to "populate or perish".

In a nation then seeing itself as culturally nearer to Europe than Asia, a wave of Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrants fleeing conflict through the 1970s and 80s also stirred unease.

But when the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States brought increased border protection globally, asylum worries in Australia were shaped into a political spear, helping conservative prime minister John Howard return to power that year with a promise of uncompromising security.

Now, with instability in Afghanistan, Syria and Iran driving refugee numbers globally to near a 20-year high of 45.2 million, asylum boats are again coloring the election race, up with bread and butter issues like the economy and education.

Since Labor swept away Howard's conservatives six years ago, more than 50,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Australia, stoking a voter backlash so visceral that Rudd in July promised no one arriving by boat would be permanently settled, being instead sent to live in neighboring Papua New Guinea or Nauru.

Canberra's approach contrasts with moves by key ally the United States to offer a pathway to citizenship for many of its 11 million illegal immigrants, although European countries have also hardened immigration rules amid global financial woes.

But while Australia's policy - matching opposition promises of tougher immigration rules - was criticized by the United Nations, political pundits say it could neutralize an issue threatening to send Labor into opposition for a generation.

AUSTRALIA FOR FREEDOM

In the My Hung fabric shop in Sydney's Cabramatta, an area dubbed "little Saigon" with its myriad noodle shops and migrant families from Vietnam and Cambodia, Thi Duc Diep underscores the problems facing Rudd on Labor's Sydney "Western Front".

Located in one of 10 marginal seats held by the government and at risk of loss, almost six in 10 people here were born overseas and average income of $1,030 a week is well short of the national figure, while 10 percent unemployment is roughly double the national average.

Greater Sydney, home to 4.6 million people, is not only one of the most expensive cities to buy property, with home prices soaring 6.1 percent this year to a median $640,000, but surveys put it near Zurich and Geneva as one of the least affordable places to live, a fifth more expensive than New York.

Diep fled Saigon by boat in 1978, and like many other overseas-born Australian voters now has a deep antipathy to asylum seekers, who she believes are fleeing for largely economic reasons and the promise of generous welfare.

"We came here for freedom. We worked hard to be honest," the bespectacled 53-year-old says. "I don't want people who don't want to go to work. They shouldn't just take the unemployment benefits."

Along with asylum, Diep blames the soaring cost of living and new carbon taxes championed by Rudd for undermining the $1.5 trillion economy, reflected now in gloomy business confidence and fears of the first recession for 22 years as a China-led resource export boom fades.

In an alley around the corner, cafe owner and swing voter Eddie Nguyen also wants Labor out, and says many of his customers are hoping to see conservative opposition leader Tony Abbott become prime minister.

"I think Australia's government should have strong rules, a strong commitment to protect Australians," says Nguyen, who spent three years in a refugee camp in Indonesia before being accepted as a refugee to Australia in 1987.

"I don't agree with people going direct to the country like this. It's like your family, someone knocks on your door and says I want to come into your house, and you have to accept them. That's just not right. You have to go somewhere and wait until somebody accepts you."

LAND OF GOLD AND HONEY

Pollster John Scales of JWS Research says much of the anger being directed against Labor has its roots in a kind of racist-tinged envy, with migrant voters worried that new boat arrivals from other countries will lessen their chances of bringing more family members to Australia.

Australia's population growth to near 23 million was driven mostly by a doubling in net migration in eight years, from around 120,000 to around 240,000, helping fill mining jobs but bringing fresh problems.

"Once you get here, it's not the land of gold and honey. Asylum seekers are where frustration gets vented," Scales says. "It's a different sort of racism to standard Australian Anglo-Saxon racism. But it's still racism."

Labor MP Michelle Rowland, whose Sydney seat of Greenway is one of the most precariously balanced, says Labor is in difficulty because Western Sydney has become increasingly frustrated and ambitious.

Not helping, she says, has been a frontpage campaign against Labor by billionaire media owner Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, which have been particularly critical of asylum policy switches under Labor.

"When you're sitting in a traffic jam on the motorway or waiting for a train that never comes, it's easy to think about the taxes you've paid and the benefits others might get," Rowland says. "Asylum is right up there."

Abbott, mindful of the simmering mood for change, has made Western Sydney a top priority, visiting often with a promise of tougher asylum seeker laws, which he says will reduce hundreds of boats arriving now to a trickle, and to reinvigorate economic confidence by scrapping carbon taxes and building new roads.

"We will build the roads of the 21st century and we will stop the boats," he told journalists on a recent swing through the area.

"The message that I give to the people of Australia and to the people of Western Sydney is that if you want a new way, you've got to choose a new government."



headline: Thousands flee to Central African Republic airport to escape ex-rebels
byline: By Paul-Marin Ngoupana
6:20pm EDT

Thousands of civilians fled to the Central African Republic's main international airport to escape marauding former rebel fighters and occupied the tarmac for around 18 hours, blocking some flights from landing, witnesses and officials said.

The Central African Republic has descended into chaos since the Seleka rebels swept into Bangui in March, toppling President Francois Bozize and unleashing a wave of violence that new leader Michel Djotodia has failed to control.

Residents of the Boeing quarter adjacent to the capital's M'poko airport began fleeing their homes on Tuesday night after Seleka fighters starting shooting up their neighborhood.

Peacekeepers present at the airport intervened on Wednesday, firing water cannons and tear gas to disperse the crowd after some protesters began throwing stones at them. By late afternoon the runway had been cleared, government officials and peacekeepers said.

"There were no deaths, just a few wounded. But the situation is under control," new security and public order minister Josue Binoua told Reuters, adding that flights into the capital were expected to resume on Thursday.

The occupation of the airport kept several flights, including one run by Morocco's national carrier Royal Air Maroc, from landing.

A senior officer with the Central African regional peacekeeping mission based at the airport said the thousands of civilians who fled there overnight had refused to leave the tarmac.

"They came here because they are afraid," he said. The peacekeepers were forced to intervene to stop Seleka fighters from entering, he said.

Residents of the Boeing neighborhood said that what started as an evacuation had become a protest against the state of lawlessness.

"Our presence here at the airport has one goal - to get the world's attention. Because we are fed up with these Seleka," said Antoine Gazama.

Seleka, a grouping of five rebel movements that Djotodia used to lead, has repeatedly raided rural villages and Bangui neighborhoods under the pretext of searching for weapons caches and armed Bozize loyalists.

Human rights groups say they are responsible for widespread looting, torture and summary executions.

French President Francois Hollande called on the U.N. Security Council and the African Union on Tuesday to stabilize the situation in the Central African Republic, warning that it was at risk of going the way of Somalia.

The security minister said the airport occupation forced Djotodia to call an emergency meeting during which the government decided to ban Seleka from entering Bangui neighborhoods.

"Only the forces of order, notably the police and gendarmes, are authorized to ensure and reestablish order in the country and particularly in the city of Bangui," Binoua said.

Senior U.N. officials warned earlier this month that the Central African Republic was on the brink of collapse and said the crisis was threatening to spread beyond its borders.

They called for the Security Council to fund and support an African Union peacekeeping force.



headline: Colombian peace talks recess with scant progress, election looms
byline: By Marc Frank
6:20pm EDT

The Colombian government and leftist FARC rebels wound up a 13th round of peace negotiations on Wednesday, bickering over how to end the conflict and making little visible progress over key issues despite nine months of talks.

While the discussion was supposed to focus on the political participation of Colombia's Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), it was overshadowed by a proposed referendum on any deal that was submitted by President Juan Manuel Santos to congress last week and scheduled to occur during national elections next year.

The FARC called a pause in the negotiations after Santos made the referendum proposal, which it strongly opposes.

The FARC has insisted a constituent assembly be formed to incorporate the content of the peace deals into the countryÂ´s constitution. The government has rejected that demand.

The talks recess every few weeks, then resume, with the next round set to begin September 9. They are being facilitated by Cuba and Norway and hosted in Havana even as fighting continues in Colombia.

Earlier in the talks the two sides settled on a partial accord on agrarian reform. They still have before them reparations to war victims, the drug trade and then implementing the agreement.

The rebels' lead negotiator, Ivan Marquez, read a statement at the close of the round of negotiations that was largely dedicated to denouncing the referendum and defending a constituent assembly.

He said the referendum issue had diverted the talks.

"Though there are concrete advances, we are inviting the government to take up again the second point of the agenda, which corresponds to the current rounds," he said.

'CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS'

The government's lead negotiator, Humberto de la Calle, for his part defended the referendum.

"It is our responsibility to foresee possible future scenarios and, as President Santos has said, in this way pave the way toward peace," he said.

Both sides did say they had exchanged proposals on how to bring the FARC out of the jungle and into the political process, without indicating that any agreements were reached.

"We continue to make progress on the forging of agreements on the second point of the conversations, political participation," the joint statement said without elaborating.

The Colombian government wants a peace agreement by November when a national electoral cycle begins, concluding with a presidential vote in May, 2014, a deadline both parties and observers now say will not be met.

Santos, who is expected to run for a second term, has staked his legacy on bringing an end to the last guerilla conflict in Latin America, which has raged since 1964, as well as a smaller rebel insurgency by the National Liberation Army (ELN).

The FARC has an estimated 8,000 members and the ELN about 3,000.

A source close to the talks said that amid the political rhetoric and bullets progress was being made.

"Each side has a public face and another at the talks, where they are very serious and working hard," he said, asking not to be identified.

"They have a long ways to go but are making progress and appear committed to the process," he added.

At the same time the source expressed concern that elections could derail the talks if Colombians tired of them.

"The key will be what the polls say as the elections proceed," he said.

6:20pm EDT

Seven people were killed in an attack claimed by the Taliban on a base operated by Polish and Afghan forces in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday, officials and a Reuters witness said.

Ghanzi province's deputy governor said the attackers detonated an explosive-laden truck at the rear of the base and a car bomb at the main gate, before a six hour gunbattle inside involving up to 10 of the 15 assailants.

Four policemen and three civilians were killed, and 10 Polish soldiers and 52 Afghan security force members and civilians had been wounded by the time the fighting ended around 10 p.m., Ahmadullah Ahmadi said.

Violence has intensified across Afghanistan this week as Taliban insurgents seek to increase pressure on NATO contingents preparing to withdraw by the end of 2014.

Another 20 people died in a spate of bombings elsewhere in the country over the past 24 hours.

Claiming responsibility for the attack on the base, the Taliban said a suicide bomber detonated himself near a truck loaded with explosives.

"The bombing wiped out the security posts and the first checkpoint while other fighters, armed with heavy and light weapons, managed to get inside," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in an email.

Gunshots rang into the night following the attack at around 4 p.m. A Reuters witness saw column of black smoke rising from the base in the provincial capital.

Elsewhere in Afghanistan, two attacks in Helmand province on Wednesday killed three soldiers, 10 Afghan civilians and wounded more than 20 other people, police and provincial officials said.

One of the attacks took place in Helmand's provincial capital Lashkar Gah, where a suicide bomber blew himself up near a foreign troop convoy but without killing or wounding any of the soldiers targeted, a spokeswoman for the NATO-led force said.

In the second attack, on the outpost of Nad Ali in Helmand, a suicide bomber in a car killed three soldiers, officials said.

Helmand has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting between NATO-led forces and the insurgents since the overthrow of the radical Islamist Taliban in 2001.

On Tuesday, in the western province of Farah, Taliban insurgents torched 40 trucks that supply NATO-led forces with fuel and killed six Afghan drivers, the provincial governor's spokesman, Abdul Rahman Zhwanday, said.

And in Kabul, a suicide bomber targeted a government ministry, killing himself and one other person, according to security sources in the capital.



headline: Bombs kill 86 in Baghdad as sectarian violence spreads
byline: By Kareem Raheem
6:20pm EDT

A series of car bombings and other attacks across Baghdad on Wednesday killed 86 people and wounded 263, police and medical sources said, extending the worst wave of sectarian bloodshed in Iraq for at least five years.

It was not immediately clear who carried out the attacks, which appeared coordinated, but Sunni Muslim insurgents including the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq have significantly stepped up bombings this year.

More than two years of civil war in neighboring Syria have aggravated deep-rooted sectarian divisions in Iraq, fraying the country's uneasy coalition of Shi'ite Muslim, Sunni Muslim and Kurdish factions.

In Sadr City, an impoverished Shi'ite district in Baghdad's northeast, two car bombs killed seven people. A restaurant owner said he saw an attacker just before one of the explosions.

"A man parked his car in front of the restaurant. He got breakfast and drank his tea. (Then) I heard a huge explosion when I was inside the kitchen," the owner, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.

"When I went outside, I saw his car completely destroyed and he had disappeared. Many people were hurt."

Car bombs hit south, north and western Baghdad in a cluster of attacks early in the day and late in the evening which targeted both Shi'ite and Sunni areas of the capital.

The Interior Ministry described the attacks as "terrorist explosions" but said the number of people killed was only 20, with 213 wounded. The Shi'ite-led Baghdad government has said that media reports exaggerate attacks in Iraq and that security forces have stopped many attempted bombings.

However, Wednesday's violence was worst since August 10, when nearly 80 people were killed during a religious holiday.

ONE THOUSAND DIED IN JULY

More than 1,000 Iraqis were killed in July, the highest monthly death toll since 2008, according to the United Nations.

The renewed violence, 18 months after U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq, has stirred anxiety about a relapse towards the widespread sectarian slaughter of 2006-07.

In other attacks on Wednesday, gunmen killed six members of al-Sahwa - former Sunni insurgents who rebelled against al Qaeda - in an ambush on a checkpoint in Latifiya, a suburb 40 km (25 miles) south of Baghdad.

Gunmen also stormed a Shi'ite home in the same area, killing six family members, police and medical sources said.

In Kadhimiya, a neighborhood in northwestern Baghdad, two roadside bombs and one car bomb killed five people and wounded nearly 30, the sources said.

Four soldiers were killed and five were wounded in Madaen, southeast of Baghdad, by a roadside bomb which targeted an Iraqi army patrol, police and medics said.

After years of reduced violence, the intensity of attacks has dramatically risen since the start of 2013. Bombings have often targeted cafes and other places where families gather, as well as the usual military facilities and checkpoints.



headline: Italy reaches deal on housing tax, easing pressure on Letta
byline: By Giuseppe Fonte
6:20pm EDT

Italy's government reached a deal on Wednesday to reform an unpopular property tax, easing a source of persistent tension which had threatened to split the fragile coalition of traditional rivals from the left and right.

The cabinet agreed to abolish the housing tax IMU from the start of 2014, Prime Minister Enrico Letta told reporters, replacing it with a new levy known as the "Service Tax".

The two installments of IMU on principal residences which were due in September and December 2013 will be scrapped, Letta said after the cabinet meeting.

Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) party has insisted that IMU on principal residences must be abolished as a price for backing Letta, raising fears that failure to reach a deal could provoke a political crisis.

The tussle over the tax has exacerbated an already bitter political climate caused by Berlusconi's conviction this month for tax fraud and an approaching vote in the Senate on whether to expel him from parliament.

Wednesday's deal removes an immediate headache for Letta, though tensions are likely to emerge over the formulation of the Service Tax which will take its place by combining IMU with another tax on refuse disposal.

What is certain is that Italy's strained public finances cannot do without the roughly 24 billion euros ($32 billion) currently yielded by IMU, which is also imposed on commercial property and secondary residences such a holiday homes.

"I am happy and satisfied, this is the most balanced solution that could be achieved," Letta said, adding that details of the Service Tax will be presented along with the 2014 budget in October.

The scrapping of the IMU payments on principal residences due this year will cost around 4 billion euros, to be funded partly by increased sales tax revenues from firms benefiting from an acceleration of back-payments owed by the public sector.

SPENDING CUTS

There will also be an increase in taxation of gambling and spending cuts which have yet to be been finalized, Economy Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni said.

Saccomanni also announced that the government would release a further 10 billion euros of payments to companies before the end of this year, on top of the 40 billion euros already agreed.

Berlusconi, who had made the abolition of IMU on primary residences a political crusade, was exultant.

"Promised and achieved," he said in a statement, adding that "ethics in politics means keeping promises. The PDL has respected its pact with its voters and Letta has respected his deal with the PDL".

Letta's centre-left Democratic Party (PD) had resisted demands to eliminate IMU on primary residences altogether, saying it would hit local services and other priorities including unemployment support.

It had proposed limited cuts that would have exempted most Italians while still imposing a levy on richer homeowners.

After weeks of relative calm for Italian government bonds, the uncertainty surrounding both the IMU issue and Berlusconi's conviction has unnerved investors, hitting Italian stocks this week and driving borrowing costs higher.

The main gauge of market sentiment, the spread between Italian 10-year bond yields and their safer German equivalents has widened markedly in recent days, climbing 30 basis points over the past two weeks to as high as 261 basis points on Wednesday.

The deal averts the threat of an immediate crisis which could bring on new elections, but the long months of wrangling have hurt the government's ability to achieve major economic reforms.

With Italy still struggling to emerge from its longest post-war recession, the government's problems range from 40 percent youth unemployment to the 2-trillion-euro public debt, and the long argument about the tax has bemused many observers.

"If the only problem facing Italy was IMU then you could say the country was doing pretty well," Riccardo Nuti, lower house parliamentary leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement told RAI state radio. "But it's obvious the country isn't doing well and it has problems that are very different from IMU."

headline: Arab League ministers to blame Syria's Assad for chemical attack
byline: By Ayman Samir and Yasmine Saleh
6:20pm EDT

Assad for last week's chemical weapons attack in Damascus when they meet in Cairo next week, League officials said on Wednesday.

The states' permanent representatives at the League had already explicitly blamed Assad on Tuesday for the attack, which killed hundreds of civilians, in a step that provided regional political cover for a possible U.S.-led military strike on Syria.

A senior U.S. official said planning was under way for possibly several days of attacks by several countries, likely to include its NATO allies France and Britain, to punish Assad.

The higher-level endorsement by the Arab foreign ministers at their meeting on September 2-3 is being pushed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which both back anti-Assad rebels in Syria's civil war, as well as Qatar, a non-Gulf official at the League said.

Syria's neighbors Iraq and Lebanon, along with Algeria, are likely to oppose or abstain from condemning Syria, as they have on similar resolutions in the past. Syria itself is suspended from the League.

"The Arab foreign ministers will affirm the full responsibility of the Syrian regime for the chemical weapons' attack that took place in Eastern Ghouta (on the outskirts of Damascus)," a representative of a Gulf state in the League told Reuters.

"We will also ask for those responsible for the attack to be taken to the International Criminal Court," he added.

The non-Gulf Arab League source confirmed the Gulf official's remarks.

"The world must see the Arab states seriously condemning Assad's use of chemicals and calling for his punishment," he said.

He also called on the U.N. Security Council to adopt tougher sanctions on Syria and urged Russia and China, Assad's backers in the council, not to block any council resolution proposing action against Assad.

Syria's civil war has split the region broadly along sectarian lines.

Shi'ite Muslim Iran, and its allies in Lebanon and Iraq, support Assad. The Sunni-led Gulf Arab states, led by oil giant Saudi Arabia and influential Qatar, have backed the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels, many of whom are Islamist militants.

Nigeria charged two of its citizens on Wednesday with assisting an Iranian militant cell in planning possible attacks on Israeli targets, alleging that one had travelled to Tehran and Dubai to receive cash and had known about spying on Israeli interests.

The secret service (SSS) arrested Abdullahi Mustapha Berende and Saheed Oluremi Adewumi, plus one other Nigerian, in February. It accused them of being members of a "high profile terrorist network" that was planning attacks on home soil.

The alleged cell was not named in the charge sheet. Iran has never responded to the allegations.

Nigerian authorities are growing concerned about an apparent surge in interest in the West African country by Shi'ite Muslim militant groups with links to Iran or Lebanon. Three Lebanese have been in court over an alleged Hezbollah plot since June.

Although the threat pales in comparison to Sunni Islamist groups like al Qaeda or Nigerian outfit Boko Haram, recent cases have raised alarm.

Berende is accused of travelling to Iran to help with "material assistance and terrorist training ... in the use of fire arms, explosives and other related weapons."

He is also accused of knowing about spying on two Israeli targets in Lagos - the Chabad Lubavitch Jewish centre and the Lagos branch of AA Consulting - but failing to alert police.

The charge did not make clear whether he himself is accused of doing the spying, but the SSS had earlier suggested he did.

The charges also say he took $30,000 in funding to carry out operations. He and Adewumi were both accused of aiding a Iranian terrorist group, including by using cameras to help them.

Iran has been in the spotlight in Nigeria before. In 2010, authorities at a Lagos port found a shipment of artillery rockets, rifle rounds and other weapons from Iran. A Nigerian and an Iranian each received a five-year sentence in May for smuggling the weapons.

An Iranian diplomat was arrested in 2004 on suspicion of spying on the Israeli embassy in Nigeria's capital Abuja, Israeli sources said. Iran denied any arrest.

6:20pm EDT

Colombia extradited Diego Perez Henao, one of the country's most wanted gang leaders, to the United States on Wednesday to face charges for alleged cocaine trafficking and involvement in hundreds of murders, Colombia's prison authority said.

Henao, who goes by the alias Diego Rastrojo, was handed over to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials under tight security at a military airport in Bogota, the Colombian capital, and put on a U.S.-bound plane.

One of the heads of the Rastrojos criminal gang, Henao was captured in Venezuela in June 2012, then deported home to Colombia. A $5 million bounty was offered for his capture.

News pictures showed Henao being escorted to the plane by Colombian police, handcuffed and wearing a blue "Los Angeles" polo shirt.

Colombia's five main criminal gangs, which have around 3,800 members, were mostly formed after the disbanding of right-wing paramilitary groups in 2006.

Many of the paramilitary units morphed into criminal gangs supplying cocaine to cartels in Mexico and the United States, making the arrest of their leaders a top priority for Washington in its battle against drug trafficking.

Colombia is one of the world's top cocaine producers, making around 300 tons a year even after U.S.-backed efforts to stamp out the illegal trade. The country's leftist guerrillas, the FARC and the smaller ELN group, levy taxes on local production of coca but deny involvement in trafficking the drug.

The coca leaf is the raw material used to make cocaine.

The government has been in peace negotiations with the FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, since last November. Both the FARC and ELN, or National Liberation Army, are considered terrorist organizations by the United States and European Union.

headline: South African gold producers gear up for strikes from Sunday
byline: By Ed Stoddard and Sherilee Lakmidas

stakes fight between capital and labor in Africa's biggest economy.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) will give gold producers on Friday 48-hours' notice of its members' intention to strike over deadlocked wage talks, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

"The decision to issue a strike notice on Friday has now been taken," the source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. Workers could then begin stoppages from the Sunday night or Monday morning shifts in the country's gold mines.

A complete shutdown of the gold sector could cost South Africa more than $35 million a day in lost output, according to calculations based on the spot price.

This will pile pressure on a struggling economy already weighed down by a slew of ongoing strikes in auto manufacturing, construction and aviation services, and facing threatened stoppages by textile workers and petrol station employees.

On Saturday, NUM gave bullion producers, including AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Sibanye Gold and Harmony Gold, a seven-day ultimatum to meet its demand for pay rises of up to 60 percent or face strike action.

The country's Chamber of Mines, which negotiates on behalf of gold producers, said on Tuesday it had made a final offer to unions to increase basic wages by between 6 and 6.5 percent.

NUM, which represents 64 percent of the country's gold miners, dismissed this offer. Another more militant mining union is seeking pay hikes as high as 150 percent.

The companies say these demands are unrealistic as they are being badly squeezed by rising costs and falling bullion prices.

South Africa's declining gold industry was caught off guard last year when violent wildcat strikes spread from platinum to gold shafts, costing 5 billion rand ($500 million) in lost output. The strife in the mines, rooted in a union turf war, dented economic growth and led to sovereign credit downgrades.

This time round, the companies plan to be better prepared.

"We have planned for a three-month strike ... are prepared for that level of disruption," said James Wellsted, spokesman at Sibanye Gold.

Experts say producers can shut down costly power-intensive functions such as underground ventilation, mine high-grade deposits with skeleton staff and maintain some surface activity.

The gold companies are also increasing security, preparing for the possibility of violence after more than 50 people were killed last year in clashes in the mines, including 34 striking miners shot dead by police at the Marikana platinum mine.

The labor mayhem raised questions about the ability of President Jacob Zuma's ANC government to manage social tensions fuelled by poverty, inequality and unemployment affecting millions of South Africans 19 years after the end of apartheid.

CASH CUSHIONS

Wage talks are deadlocked with other unions as well, including NUM's more hardline rival the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), which wants wage hikes of up to 150 percent for the lowest-paid miners.

"We're not ruling out a strike but we need to consult with members first," AMCU General Secretary Jeffrey Mphahlele said.

Of the producers, Sibanye is the more exposed, because South Africa accounts for all of its production. But it said in its first half results it had $200 million in cash resources, which can help it to ride out a prolonged stoppage.

Its rivals also have deep pockets and capital resources. "All of them have enough cash to get through this," said David Davis, banking investment analyst at SBG Securities.

Zuma's government, which denies charges by critics that it has paid more attention to the country's wealthy business elite than to the masses of workers, poor and unemployed, has called for all sides in the labor disputes to avoid violence.

"Parties must engage and negotiate in good faith," said Nkosinathi Nhleko, director general in the Department of Labour.

South Africa has some of the most conflict-ridden labor relations in the world, studies show, reflecting big inequalities between a super-rich elite and comfortable middle class and a large majority of citizens struggling to get by in the face of rising costs of transport and living essentials.

The country ranks last among a list of 144 countries in terms of cooperation in labor-employer relations, according the World Economic Forum's Global Competitive Index for 2012-13.

The index also ranks South Africa as having some of the world's most rigid laws in terms of hiring and firing, a factor which puts off foreign investors who could create needed jobs.

Productivity measured against global competitors has also suffered. The South African government's own data shows that since 2000, real after-inflation wages in South Africa have risen 53 percent, while productivity fell by 41 percent.

byline: By Paul-Marin Ngoupana
6:20pm EDT

Thousands of civilians have fled to the Central African Republic's main international airport to escape marauding former rebel fighters and have occupied the tarmac, blocking some flights from landing, witnesses and officials said.

Residents of the Boeing quarter adjacent to the capital's M'poko airport began fleeing their homes on Tuesday night after Seleka fighters starting shooting up their neighborhood.

The Central African Republic has descended into chaos since the rebels swept into Bangui in March, toppling President Francois Bozize and unleashing a wave of violence that new leader Michel Djotodia has failed to control.

"There are thousands of people in the airport and on the tarmac since last night after the Seleka raid," said a senior officer with a Central African regional peacekeeping mission based at the airport.

"They came here because they are afraid," he said. The peacekeepers were forced to intervene to stop Seleka fighters from entering, he said.

Seleka, a grouping of five rebel movements that Djotodia used to lead, has repeatedly raided rural villages and Bangui neighborhoods under the pretext of searching for weapons caches and armed Bozize loyalists.

But human rights groups say they are responsible for widespread looting, torture and summary executions.

French President Francois Hollande called on the U.N. Security Council and the African Union on Tuesday to stabilize the situation in the Central African Republic, warning it was at risk of going the way of Somalia.

Residents of the Boeing neighborhood said what started as an evacuation had become a protest against the state of lawlessness.

"Our presence here at the airport has one goal - to get the world's attention. Because we are fed up with these Seleka," said Antoine Gazama.

"We won't leave this airport until Djotodia can ensure our daily security and that of our children against these bloodthirsty Selekas," said Jocelyne Yetimbi, who fled to the airport with her four children.

Speaking on state radio on Wednesday, new security and public order minister Josue Binoua said the occupation of the airport had kept several flights, including one run by Morocco's national carrier Royal Air Maroc, from landing.

He said the situation had forced Djotodia to call an emergency meeting during which the government decided to ban Seleka from entering Bangui neighborhoods.

"Only the forces of order, notably the police and gendarmes, are authorized to ensure and reestablish order in the country and particularly in the city of Bangui," Binoua said.

Senior U.N. officials warned earlier this month that the country was on the brink of collapse and the crisis was threatening to spread beyond its borders.

They called for the Security Council to fund and support an African Union peacekeeping force.

headline: Bring on euro debate, Merkel aide tells rivals before TV duel
byline: By Stephen Brown and Andreas Rinke
6:20pm EDT

Angela Merkel is relishing the chance to debate the euro zone crisis with challenger Peer Steinbrueck in their only TV duel of the election campaign, despite a row over Greek aid that has put her government on the defensive, her campaign chief said.

Just over three weeks before the election, Steinbrueck's Social Democrats (SPD) have accused Merkel of hiding the true cost of the euro crisis from German voters.

Her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder has suggested she is lying about the prospects of another bailout for Greece, and Steinbrueck has promised to raise the subject in Sunday's debate.

But Hermann Groehe, who as secretary general of the Christian Democrats (CDU) is in charge of Merkel's campaign for a third term, said she would welcome an argument on Europe.

"We are glad to debate European politics because the high approval ratings that Angela Merkel enjoys among the German population arise not least from the confidence she has gained among the people through her successful work on the European debt crisis," he told Reuters.

"We have to defend the euro - from Red-Green softies who want to turn it into a 'debt union' and those who want a collapse of the euro zone or a return to the Deutsche mark."

He was referring to SPD proposals for shared euro zone debt liability and to calls by a new eurosceptic party, the Alternative for Germany, for a return to national currencies.

Polls suggest Merkel will win a third term but it is unclear whether she will be able to repeat her alliance with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) or will have to revive the "grand coalition" between her conservatives and the SPD of 2005-2009.

The debate over aid to Greece flared last week after Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble broke a pre-election taboo and acknowledged that a third package was all but inevitable.

Until then, Merkel had refused to discuss the possibility, saying it was an issue that must be decided in 2014 or even 2015.

Groehe, a stocky 52-year-old who accompanies Merkel on her helicopter trips around Germany to campaign, said international pressure for action against Syria over a gas attack on civilians could also figure in the debate, but should not be politicized.

Like other German officials, he said the United Nations had to ensure the attack was investigated but was cautious about the prospect of Germany participating in any military action.

Polls show a majority of Germans oppose a military strike in Syria, but politicians also worry that Berlin could once again be marginalized if it does not support its allies. In 2011, Germany's reputation suffered when it sided with China and Russia in refusing to back a U.N. vote authorizing military intervention in Libya.

The SPD and the traditionally pacifist Greens have stressed the risk of armed action against Syria.

scale mobilization of reservists on Wednesday and strengthened its missile defenses as precautions against possible Syrian attack should Western powers carry out threatened strikes on Syria.

But an Israeli official briefed on a meeting of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet said the Jewish state believed the probability of it be targeted by Syria, its northern neighbor and long-time foe, was low.

"Following a security assessment held today, there is no reason for a change to normal routines," Netanyahu said in a statement. "We are, in parallel, preparing for any scenario."

That included a limited call-up of military reserve soldiers and deployment of an advanced missile shield in the north, the official said. Israel Radio said mobilization of several hundred troops in intelligence and air defense had been authorized.

Army Radio reported the military was using all of its missile defenses, which include the short-range Iron Dome, the mid-range Patriot and the long-range Arrow II.

Facing potentially imminent attack by the United States and other Western powers over its alleged use of chemical weapons, Damascus has hinted it could shoot back at the Jewish state. Israel is also braced for possible rocket salvoes from Hezbollah, Syria's Lebanese militia ally.

Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israel sought to stay out of the Syrian crisis but would respond forcefully to any attempt to attack it.

Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon said after the security cabinet meeting on Wednesday that Israel was "taking steps for just in case".

In a speech in Tel Aviv, Yaalon said Israel's "finger is not light on the trigger but whoever around us presumes they can challenge us by a threat will of course encounter our might if there is any attempt to hurt us or our citizens".

Assad, preoccupied with a 2-1/2 year-old uprising against his rule and facing a militarily superior enemy in Israel, has held his fire in the face of three Israeli air strikes in Syria this year on advanced weaponry.

But many in Israel worry that he could lash out if he felt his back was against the wall, and long lines formed on Wednesday at gas mask distribution centers.

Israel has provided its citizens with equipment to cope with possible chemical or biological attacks since the 1991 Gulf War, when U.S.-led troops drove Iraq out of Kuwait.

According to official figures, however, only about 60 percent of Israelis collected their gas masks before the current tensions over Syria erupted. The Israeli Postal Service, which oversees mask distribution, said the number of orders phoned in by the public in recent days had quadrupled.

"We just want to be prepared. I'd say it's a bit of a surreal experience," a Jerusalem resident, who gave his name only as Tovy, said at a distribution center. "I just really pray we're never going to really need to use it."



headline: Egypt backs away from plan to dissolve Muslim Brotherhood
byline: By Lin Noueihed
6:20pm EDT

Egypt should not ban the Muslim Brotherhood or exclude it from politics after the army's overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi, the interim prime minister said, reversing his previous stated view.

The apparent about-turn fuelled speculation that the military-installed government may now seek a political settlement to the crisis, but also coincided with a new call for protests by Mursi's supporters.

Hazem el-Beblawi, the interim prime minister, had proposed on August 17 that the Brotherhood, the Arab world's oldest and arguably most influential Islamist group, should be dissolved, and said the government was studying the idea.

In an interview with state media late on Tuesday, Beblawi appeared to row back, saying the government would instead monitor the group and its political wing and that the actions of its members would determine its fate.

"Dissolving the party or the group is not the solution and it is wrong to make decisions in turbulent situations," the state news agency MENA quoted Beblawi as saying.

"It is better for us to monitor parties and groups in the framework of political action without dissolving them or having them act in secret."

But he tempered his comments in a separate interview with the newspaper al-Shorouk, saying parts of Egyptian society "think that the Brotherhood does not truly desire reconciliation", and urging it to "face up to reality".

The government has portrayed its attack on the Brotherhood as a fight against terrorism, and Beblawi said ordinary citizens were "afraid of reconciliation with people who use force".

There has been no sign from the Brotherhood, most of whose leaders are now in jail or on the run, that it wants to engage with the army establishment that bulldozed it out.

OUTLAWED FOR DECADES

Founded in 1928, the Brotherhood was banned by Egypt's then military rulers in 1954. Though still outlawed during the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak, it ran a large welfare network and its members ran as independents in limited elections.

After decades of operating in the shadows and winning support with its charities and preaching, the Brotherhood registered itself as a non-governmental organization in March in response to a court challenge by people contesting its legality.

It also has a registered political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), set up in 2011 after Mubarak's overthrow in an uprising. The Brotherhood won all five national votes held since 2011, including Mursi's election as president last year.

But Mursi alienated swathes of Egyptians during his year in power and, after mass protests, the army removed him on July 3.

More than 1,000 people, including about 100 police and soldiers, have since been killed in the worst internal violence in the Egyptian republic's history. Most died when the security forces dispersed two pro-Mursi protest camps on August 14. State media have described the crackdown as a war on "terrorism".

With the Brotherhood in shock, protests that it called last Friday mostly failed to materialize.

The National Coalition to Support Legitimacy and Reject the Coup, which includes the Brotherhood and demands Mursi's reinstatement, promised protests in the streets and squares of all of Egypt's 27 provinces this Friday and said it would "activate a plan of peaceful civil disobedience".

The newspaper run by the Brotherhood's FJP ran an advertisement under the banner "Boycott the murderers", urging citizens not to watch the television channels of the "old regime"; not to pay taxes to "the government that is killing us"; and not to buy products made by companies that it accused of supporting the military-backed interim government.

The government says it will call parliamentary and presidential elections within months, after the passage of a new constitution.

headline: Somalia strikes deal with former Islamist over port city
byline: By Aaron Maasho and Richard Lough
6:20pm EDT

Somalia's central government agreed on Wednesday to recognize a former Islamist commander as the interim leader of the southern Juba region, a deal that could help end months of clan fighting and cement plans for a federal nation.

Diplomats said the pact signed in Ethiopia's capital, after days of talks and delays, was a significant step towards stabilizing Somalia as it seeks to create devolved government, and could become a blueprint for sharing power in other areas.

An official from Mogadishu's government signed the deal with Sheikh Ahmed Madobe, who has been vying for control of Jubaland's port city of Kismayu and its hinterland against a clan warlord widely seen as backed by Mogadishu.

"We are hopeful that this process will be a starting point for Somalia to be a federal state," Madobe said at the signing, through a translator. "There will be people who won't be happy, but the fundamental issue is the interest of the Somali people."

At the heart of the tussle over Kismayu has been control of the area's economic resources, in particular its lucrative port.

The fate of Somalia's second biggest city has been seen as a litmus test for the future of the Horn of Africa nation as it rebuilds from the ruins of war and anchors a wobbly peace.

That quest has been hampered by the central government's weakness outside the capital and its troubled relations with provinces seeking more autonomy than it has been ready to cede.

"This is really a breakthrough in a problem that has dogged the country for at least a year now," said Nick Kay, the U.N. special representative for Somalia, who was in Addis Ababa.

"It opens the door now for political progress across the whole of Somalia," he said.

Under the terms of Wednesday's deal, Madobe will be leader of the interim Juba Administration for a period of two years.

The authority under his control will manage the port for six months after which control will shift to the federal government, although revenues will pay for services in Jubaland.

LONG JOURNEY

The deal will be a relief to Somalia's neighbors and the West which fear any renewed fighting could strengthen al Shabaab Islamist rebels, who have been pushed out of major urban areas but still threaten stability in East Africa and beyond.

Somali politicians in other breakaway or more autonomous regions have continued to voice skepticism about the central government's commitment to a federation, accusing Mogadishu of trying to hog power. The government says it is ready to share.

"This deal is the beginning of a long journey for peace building, reconciliation, and for building a viable permanent administrations in these regions," Farah Sheikh Abdulkadir, Somalia's State Minister for the Presidency, told Reuters.

Madobe is a former governor of Kismayu and one-time Islamist commander under an administration crushed by Ethiopian forces sent into Somalia between 2006 and 2009 with tacit U.S. backing.

He was held in Ethiopia for two years. After his release, Madobe and his powerful Ras Kamboni militia sided with Kenyan troops against al Shabaab from late 2011, flushing the rebels out of their strongholds in the south of the country.

"The mere fact, given the nature of politics and the constituencies in Somalia, that the two sides should have decided to override factionalism and find a deal is for me absolutely fundamental," Alexander Rondos, the European Union's special representative to the Horn of Africa, said by telephone.

Riding on a wave of international support after his election in September last year, some analysts say President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has appeared reluctant to decentralize power.

Diplomats say Mohamud has lost political capital internally over his handling of Kismayu and another region, Puntland, which broke off ties with Mogadishu this month, accusing the government of failing to respect the federal structure.

Mogadishu's Abdulkadir said building such a structure needed time. "Federation requires a legal framework that is not existing and we did not inherit one. It also needs institutional capacity that is not available," he said.



headline: Russia says too early for U.N. resolution on Syria attack
byline: By Steve Gutterman
6:20pm EDT

The U.N. Security Council should wait for inspectors to present their report on an alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria before considering a response, a senior Russian diplomat said on Wednesday.

The remarks by Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov showed Russia opposes a plan by Britain to put a draft resolution to the Council on Wednesday authorizing "necessary measures" to protect Syrian civilians.

"It would be premature, at the least, to discuss any Security Council reaction until the U.N. inspectors working in Syria present their report," the Interfax news agency quoted Titov as saying.

Since the Syrian conflict began in 2011, Russia, along with China, has used its veto power in the Security Council three times to block Western-backed resolutions condemning President Bashar al-Assad and intended to press him to end the violence.

The United States and its Western allies are gearing up for a probable military strike to punish Assad, whom they blame for the alleged chemical attack last week which activists said killed hundreds of people as they slept.

Russia says it suspects rebels may have carried out the gas attack to provoke outside armed intervention, and says any use of force without U.N. approval would violate international law.

Russia has also said it will not allow a repeat in Syria of what happened in 2010 in Libya, where NATO air strikes helped rebels topple Muammar Gaddafi after Moscow let a U.N. resolution authorizing military intervention pass by abstaining.

"MONKEY WITH A GRENADE"

President Vladimir Putin and other officials accuse the United States of using human rights concerns as a pretext to support the ouster of Middle Eastern leaders Washington wants to remove from power for geopolitical reasons.

"The West behaves like a monkey with a grenade in the Islamic world," Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted.

"Whatever Washington says, the aim of a military operation (would be) regime change in Syria through the destruction of its military potential," tweeted Alexei Pushkov, who heads the international affairs committee in the lower parliament house.

Russia has also likened Western preparations for a probable strike on Syria to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, when the White House used what turned out to be false intelligence about weapons of mass destruction to justify military action.

In a phone conversation on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov rejected U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's assertion that the Syrian government was to blame for the alleged chemical attack, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

"It's unacceptable that without waiting for the results from (inspectors), accusations are being made only against the Syrian leadership," Interfax quoted an official in Putin's advisory Security Council as saying. "Where is the proof?"

The official, who was not identified, said a military strike on Syria would be likely to unleash "uncontrollable chaos in the greater Middle East and strengthen the position of extremists and terrorist groups including al Qaeda".

The Foreign Ministry, in a separate statement that made no mention of a possible Western strike on Syria, said Russia was taking "all necessary steps" to provide for the security of its diplomatic missions in Syria.

Interfax, citing a Russian naval source, reported that Russia is preparing to withdraw personnel from its naval maintenance and supply facility in the Syrian port of Tartous. The navy and Defense Ministry declined to comment.

The Emergency Situations Ministry said late on Tuesday it had evacuated 89 people who wanted to leave Syria, including 75 Russian citizens, on a flight from Latakia to Moscow. It said the ministry had flown 730 people out of Syria this year.



headline: Somalia strikes deal with former Islamist over port city

Somalia's central government agreed on Wednesday to recognize a former Islamist commander as the interim leader of the southern Juba region, a deal that should help end months of clan fighting and could cement plans for a federal nation.

Diplomats said the pact signed in Ethiopia's capital, after days of talks and delays, was a significant step towards stabilizing Somalia as it seeks to create devolved government and could become a blueprint for sharing power in other areas.

An official from Mogadishu's government signed the deal with Sheikh Ahmed Madobe, who has been vying for control of Jubaland's port city of Kismayu and its hinterland against a clan warlord widely seen as backed by Mogadishu.

"We are hopeful that this process will be a starting point for Somalia to be a federal state," Madobe said at the signing, through a translator. "There will be people who won't be happy, but the fundamental issue is the interest of the Somali people."

At the heart of the tussle over Kismayu has been control of the area's economic resources, in particular its lucrative port.

The fate of Somalia's second biggest city has been seen as a litmus test for the future of the Horn of Africa nation as it rebuilds from the ruins of war and anchor a wobbly peace.

That quest has been hampered by the central government's weakness outside the capital and its troubled relations with provinces seeking more autonomy than it has been ready to cede.

"This is really a breakthrough in a problem that has dogged the country for at least a year now," said Nick Kay, the U.N. special representative for Somalia, who was in Addis Ababa.

"It opens the door now for political progress across the whole of Somalia," he said.

Under the terms of Wednesday's deal, Madobe will be leader of the interim Juba Administration for a period of two years.

The authority under his control will manage the port for six months after which control will shift to the federal government, although revenues will pay for services in the Juba region.



headline: Tunisian Islamist radicals plans other murders, Islamic state

Sharia was planning a series of political assassinations in Tunisia in its effort to establish an Islamic emirate in North Africa, the Interior Ministry said on Wednesday.

The ministry disclosed Ansar's plans one day after Prime Minister Ali Larayedh declared it a terrorist organization and said the state now had proof the militants had killed two secular politicians and several soldiers this year.

Ansar al-Sharia is the most radical Islamist group to emerge in Tunisia since secular autocratic ruler Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled in 2011, and poses a test to the authority of the moderate Islamist-led government.

"This organization, which was collecting large quantities of weapons, planned to spread chaos and create a security vacuum through assassinations, before seizing power and establishing the first Islamic emirate in North Africa," Mustapha Ben Amor, a senior ministry official, told reporters.

Among its targets were Mustapha Ben Jaafar, chairman of the assembly writing a new constitution, former Foreign Minister Kamal Morjan, Amer Larayedh, a senior official of the governing Islamist party Ennahda, and several journalists, he said.

Tunisia, which has taken an increasingly tough line against armed militants stoking uncertainty here, is struggling to save its nascent democracy amid popular discontent and the Egyptian army's ousting of the Muslim Brotherhood government there.

Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou told the news conference that dozens of arrested Ansar members had made confessions that helped the government piece together its structure and plans.

Among the evidence he showed were documents, videos and email and Skype exchanges his ministry had obtained that he said proved Ansar was loyal to al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (AQMI). He also displayed a diagram depicting Ansar's internal hierarchy.

PRIME SUSPECT

The ministry added that Ansar, which it said received its funding from like-minded groups in Yemen, Mali and Libya, also planned to attack factories and other economic sites in Tunisia.

Ansar leader Saifallah Benahssine, also known as Abu Iyadh, is a former al Qaeda fighter in Afghanistan being sought by Tunisian police for allegedly inciting an attack on the U.S. embassy in Tunis in September 2012.

Four people were killed in those disturbances, which began as a protest over a film that mocked the Prophet Mohammad.

Ansar was the prime suspect in the assassinations of leftist secular leaders Chokri Belaid in February and Mohamed Brahmi in July, which police said were carried out with the same gun.

It was also suspected in the killing of eight soldiers, some of whose throats were slit, in the rugged Mount Chaambi area near the Algerian border in July.

The assassinations and killings of the soldiers plunged Tunisia into political turmoil late last month. The discussions and mediated contacts among politicians in recent weeks are aimed at breaking that deadlock and leading to new elections.

Ennahda, which governs in coalition with two smaller secular parties, has come under growing pressure from critics for promoting an Islamist agenda, mismanaging the economy and the security challenge from radical Salafi and jihadist Muslims.



headline: Croatia backs down in first row with EU over extradition law
byline: By Zoran Radosavljevic
6:20pm EDT

New European Union member Croatia backtracked in its first row with the bloc's executive Commission on Wednesday, agreeing to fully apply the EU extradition law after Brussels raised the prospect of sanctions.

The European Commission warned Croatia on Monday it could face legal action, including a possible loss of EU funds, because a few days before its July 1 accession Zagreb changed its laws to prevent the extradition of suspects of crimes committed before 2002, when EU rules were changed.

The government said the aim was to protect veterans from Croatia's 1991-95 independence war from facing potential prosecutions elsewhere in the EU. Several EU member states have the same 2002 time limit, including Austria and Italy.

But facing threats of punitive measures raised by the EU's justice chief Viviane Reding, Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic and Justice Minister Orsat Miljenic this week sent conciliatory letters to Reding and Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.

"On behalf of my government, the justice minister said that Croatia will take necessary measures to bring the law on judicial cooperation in line with the European legislation it had accepted in accession talks," Milanovic said in his letter to Barroso, published on the government website on Wednesday.

"Croatia has always fulfilled its obligations and will continue to do so," he said.

A spokeswoman for Commissioner Reding confirmed in Brussels that Zagreb appeared to have backed down.

"The Commission welcomes this constructive approach and now the Commission is in contact with the Croatian authorities to clarify their intention and see that these positive political intentions are swiftly followed by the required legislative action," she told reporters.

The small Adriatic state of 4.4 million people became the EU's 28th member on July 1, marking a recovery from years of war after Socialist Yugoslavia collapsed in the 1990s.

Earlier this week, the Commission accused Zagreb of contravening EU rules and said its top officials would meet next week to discuss whether punitive action should be taken.

Reding has said this could include some cuts in financial aid to Croatia, which is due to receive billions of euros in the next seven years in funds meant to bring living standards closer to the EU average.

The Commission may also introduce a monitoring mechanism to check Croatia's efforts in complying with EU rules similar to those introduced in Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in 2007, because of their slow progress in fighting corruption.

EU governments could also use the dispute over the European Arrest Warrant as an excuse to delay Croatia's progress in joining Europe's passport-free Schengen travel zone, which Zagreb said was its next priority.

Croatia's opposition HDZ party, which ruled the country in the 1990s and between 2004-2011, has accused the Social Democrat-led government of tweaking EU rules to protect former Croatian intelligence chief Josip Perkovic.

Perkovic had worked for communist Yugoslavia's secret service, the UDBA, and led intelligence services after Croatia became independent, and now faces charges in Germany over the 1983 murder of a Yugoslav dissident in Bavaria.

Prime Minister Milanovic has denied his government's policy had any connection to the German case and said Croatia wanted the same rules in applying the warrant for all members.



headline: Pakistan launches mobile mediation court to help back logged court
byline: By Jibran Ahmad
6:20pm EDT

Pakistani officials have begun offering mediation in a mobile courtroom to test whether it can help clear clogged courts.

The courtroom-on-a-bus will mediate small civil cases, minor criminal cases and juvenile cases, Hayat Ali Shah, the head of the provincial judicial academy, said Wednesday.

Cases can drag on for decades in Pakistan - there are 1.4 million pending nationally.

Some families of victims, frustrated with the moribund courts, turn to all-male gatherings of elders called jirgas instead. These offer instant decisions, but have sentenced people to be buried alive, gang-raped or stoned to death.

Judicial problems have also helped win the Taliban support when the militants offered Islamic courts dispensing swift justice.

Officials hope that new mediation can offer an alternative to the Taliban courts and traditional jirgas.

"Through this system we are trying to institutionalize mediation so that there is less of a chance that a citizen's rights will be violated," Shah said.

The mobile court heard 29 cases in its wood paneled courtroom on its first day in Peshawar on Tuesday. It freed juveniles from jail, heard property disputes and imposed small fines.

"I got justice within 10 minutes in the mobile court. My case was running for the past six months in the court of the civil judge," property dealer Adnan Khan said.

The government hopes to launch 11 more buses this year with funding from the U.N.

But lawyer Salman Raja said mediation could only work in small cases. For serious crimes, Pakistan needed more judges and better training for police, lawyers and judges, he said.



headline: Son of Chinese general denies gang rape, inflames public anger
byline: By Sui-Lee Wee
6:20pm EDT

The teenage son of a prominent Chinese general denied the charge of gang rape on Wednesday, inflaming public anger in a case that has stirred resentment against the offspring of the political elite who are widely seen as spoiled.

Li Tianyi, 17, is one of five accused of assaulting a woman in a Beijing hotel in February, according to state media.

Li has become the most prominent target of complaints that the sons and daughters of China's top-ranked Communist Party officials can dodge the law because of family influence.

Li's father is General Li Shuangjiang of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), who is a singer known for performing patriotic songs on television shows and at official events.

Li's mother, Meng Ge, is a famous singer in the PLA.

At a closed-door trial, Li said he was drunk and had no knowledge of the alleged assault, two Beijing-based state-run newspapers said on their microblogs.

Dozens of journalists as well as supporters of Li and the victim gathered outside the court in northwestern Beijing. Police officers dragged away one of Li's supporters after she was seen talking to a reporter.

Two women stood in protest outside the court, holding signs that said: "Protecting the rights of mothers, females and young girls" and "Believe in justice".

Li's denial generated a torrent of criticism online.

"The Li family continues to challenge the intelligence of normal people. They're using despicable, rogue means to acquit Li," said a microblogger. "If a heavy sentence is not imposed, it will not satisfy the people's resentment."

The case has dominated headlines for weeks, focusing attention again on China's political aristocrats who are widely viewed as corrupt and above the law.

It follows the dramatic trial of ousted former senior politician Bo Xilai, whose family's lurid excesses were detailed by the court and lapped up on social media.

Li's legal adviser, Lan He, told reporters that lawyers hoped for a fair trial.

"Celebrities are also citizens and should not be held to ransom because of emotions," he said in a question-and-answer session with bloggers on Tuesday. "A moral judgment cannot replace justice."

It is not Li's first brush with the law. In 2011, he drove a BMW into another car in Beijing, beat up the couple inside the vehicle and then scoffed at bystanders about calling the police.

He was sentenced to a year in a juvenile correctional facility and his father made a public apology.

"The general public is worried that his family, because of their relationships and power, will be able to use their connections," said Zhang Ming, a politics professor at Renmin University.

"In China, this kind of privilege is very powerful. It's omnipresent," Zhang said. "The people's fears are not groundless."

On Wednesday, "Li Tianyi" was the second-most searched topic on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, with his name generating 9.7 million search results.

In July, hackers attacked the website of one of the law firms representing Li, saying: "We just want to return justice to the client."

President Xi Jinping has made addressing discontent over abuses by officials a main goal. Rising mistrust of the government presents a potent risk for leaders who fear social instability.

Even the People's Daily, the party's mouthpiece, weighed in on Li's case when it broke, saying the failure of prominent families to educate their children could "lead to antagonism among the people".

headline: U.N. helicopters attack M23 rebels in eastern Congo
byline: By Pete Jones
6:20pm EDT

U.N. helicopters and artillery attacked M23 rebel positions near the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday in support of an offensive by the Congolese armed forces.

A 3,000-strong U.N. intervention brigade, with a tough new mandate to protect civilians and neutralize armed groups in the mineral-rich central African nation, sprang into action last week after it accused the M23 rebels of shelling Goma.

The M23 rebels, aware that their presence outside the city of 1 million people is key to their leverage in stalled peace talks, have fiercely resisted Congolese army efforts to push them back.

Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Olivier Hamuli said the U.N. brigade and regular U.N. peacekeepers had supported government forces with heavy artillery and attack helicopters.

"Combat is ongoing and there has been an intense bombardment of Kibati," said Hamuli, referring to a rebel base some 11 km (7 miles) north of Goma. "It's going well. We have not advanced much but M23 is gaining no territory."

Aftershocks of heavy artillery fire reverberated in some northern neighborhoods of Goma, causing panic, residents said.

The United Nations has taken a more proactive role since suspected rebel rockets landed in Goma on Thursday and Saturday. Five civilians were killed, according to Human Rights Watch.

Martin Kobler, the U.N. special representative to the Congo, told a news conference in Kinshasa that U.N. forces were supporting the Congolese army but could not guarantee the security of Goma.

Created in March, the U.N. brigade has a mandate for offensive missions, marking an aggressive step-up for U.N. peacekeeping operations in the region, which for years have been criticized for inaction.

Bolstered by the presence of the new brigade, Congolese President Joseph Kabila has effectively the ditched peace negotiations in the Uganda capital Kampala, analysts say, hoping the M23 can be pushed far enough not to present a threat to Goma.

The M23 humiliated the Congolese army and the United Nations' 17,000-strong peacekeeping force, known as MONUSCO, when it briefly occupied Goma in late 2012, forcing the opening of the talks.

Those negotiations have stalled, however, leading to renewed hostilities and escalating tensions between Congo and Rwanda.

U.N. investigators have accused neighboring Rwanda of supporting the 18-month M23 rebellion, an accusation Kigali has repeatedly denied.

The M23 rebels said in a statement the Congolese army and U.N. brigade had attacked its forces in Kanyaruchinya and Mutaho, to the north of Goma, with infantry, air strikes and heavy weapons.

scale gold mines after a U.S. rights group said thousands of minors were at risk from working in dangerous conditions.

New York-based Human Rights Watch said children as young as eight years old were working in small mines in Tanzania, Africa's fourth-largest gold producer.

They are at risk of injury from pit collapses and accidents with tools as well as of long-term health damage from exposure to mercury, breathing dust and carrying heavy loads, it said.

scale mines," Tanzania's deputy energy and minerals minister, Stephen Masele, told Reuters on Wednesday, the same day the report was published.

"More advocacy is needed to ensure parents understand the importance of education for their children," he said. "We have been carrying out frequent surprise inspections at mines to crack down on this problem."

There are more than 800,000 miners working in small-scale gold operations in Tanzania, thousands of whom are children, the rights group said.

"They dig and drill in deep, unstable pits, work underground for shifts of up to 24 hours, and transport and crush heavy bags of gold ore," said the report titled, "Toxic Toil: Child Labour and Mercury Exposure in Tanzania's Small-Scale Gold Mines."

The government has pledged to end the practice, but Human Rights Watch said it was not doing enough.

"On paper, Tanzania has strong laws prohibiting child labor in mining, but the government has done far too little to enforce them," said Janine Morna, a researcher at the rights group.

"Labor inspectors need to visit both licensed and unlicensed mines regularly and ensure employers face sanctions for using child labor," she said.

The group said girls who work on or near mining sites sometimes become victims of sexual exploitation and abuse.

democracy uprising of 2011 that toppled Hosni Mubarak.

Now, divided and cowed, with the army in power once more and armored vehicles inside their gates, their story could stand for the failure of Egypt's entire pro-democracy movement to build on the revolution against authoritarian rule and unite in a common cause.

The April 6 movement for social justice that began the uprising took its name from the date in 2008 when the workers of the largest textile firm in the Middle East downed tools, along with many others in the gritty industrial city of el-Mahalla el-Kubra, and were bullied back to work by the security forces.

But since the army toppled Mohamed Mursi, Mubarak's successor and Egypt's first elected leader, on July 3, and security forces shot dead hundreds of supporters of his Muslim Brotherhood, key figures in Mahalla's labor movement are not speaking to each other. They barely even share the same goals.

Widad el-Demerdash, who has worked at the state-run firm for 29 of her 47 years, fondly recalls the heady days of a series of strikes in 2006, when she and her colleague Amal el-Saeed helped to win bigger production bonuses for the factory workers.

"This was a big achievement," she said in an interview at her apartment on Monday, her day off. But the smile turns to a frown when she is asked about Saeed.

They no longer have "any relationship", she said, accusing Saeed of having joined the Brotherhood.

Demerdash agreed with the argument of the new military-led rulers that the Brotherhood is a "terrorist group" bent on destroying Egypt, in language that lays bare how polarized society has become during the most violent period in the Arab republic's modern history.

"Whoever becomes 'Brotherhood' and sells out their principles is no longer a human being," she said.

"THEY HAVE RIGHTS TOO"

Like many who backed the army takeover, Demerdash supports the violent crackdown on the Brotherhood that has followed. More than 1,000 people, mainly pro-Mursi Islamists, have been killed since July 3. The toll includes about 100 soldiers and police.

For her part, Saeed denies having joined the Brotherhood but condemns those who vilify Egypt's oldest Islamist movement. "I'm trying to tell people: 'The Brotherhood are your neighbors, they are people and they have rights like you'."

Like many of the 2011 revolutionaries, she says she voted for Mursi last year only because she could not bring herself to support his rival in the run-off, Mubarak loyalist Ahmed Shafik.

"I was among the first people to say 'Down with Mubarak'," she said. "There was no democracy in the past, and I fought for that. Now today, I'm still supporting democracy."

Saeed said the removal of Mursi had taken Egypt backwards, and that she feared the consequences for the labor movement.

She acknowledged that Mursi's government had failed to address workers' longstanding demands for a guaranteed minimum wage and limits on bosses' pay, but said progress on those and other issues such as delivery of unpaid bonuses was now less likely than ever.

"Who do we speak to now? Where is the government? The army is in charge of everything," she said in an interview on Sunday in Mahalla, where posters of army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi abound in cafes, on buildings and at traffic circles.

For all that, there seems little doubt that most workers at the factory, which has a long history of labor activism, backed the army takeover and are content for now to acquiesce.

FORCED TO CHOOSE

"The army needs to stabilize things now," said Kamel Mohamed Fayoumi, an activist who was himself arrested when Mubarak's government sent plainclothes security forces and riot police to intimidate workers during the 2008 strike.

Joel Beinin, a history professor at Stanford and an expert on labor and protest movements in the Middle East, said Egyptian workers had often succeeded in the past by managing to lay aside political differences.

"They have bread and butter interests on the line and understand they need to be united to win them," he said.

Political upheavals mean that the monolithic trade unions that largely toed the state line under Mubarak have given way to a profusion of smaller, more independent unions.

But Egypt is now is so polarized between Mursi's Islamists and the entrenched military-backed establishment that "neither the workers nor anyone else" have been able to bridge the gap.

"So people have been forced to choose. Neither choice is very good in terms of workers' interests," said Beinin.

Even those like Fayoumi who suffered under Mubarak's police state did not speak out when the army and police thwarted a strike at Misr Spinning and Weaving Company on Monday and another protest at a Suez steel factory earlier in the month.

The Mahalla protest attracted only a few hundred participants - and was quickly followed by the deployment of armored personnel carriers inside the factory compound.

Local media reported that they were protecting the factory's power station, but labor leader Mohamed El-Attar, a Mursi supporter, said even Mubarak had never dared to send troops to confront labor protests.

"These vehicles were sent by the army to terrorize workers," he said. "We must ask, who are the real terrorists in this country today?"



headline: Ghana's top court seen rejecting challenge to Mahama's vote win

fought election, legal and political experts said on Wednesday.

The decision, due by Thursday, will end months of legal wrangling that has gripped the cocoa, gold and oil-exporting nation, one of Africa's brightest economic growth prospects that has built a reputation for political stability.

Mahama won the December election with 50.7 percent of the vote and the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP) launched a Supreme Court challenge, alleging fraud ranging from inflated tallies to the participation of unregistered voters.

The court's nine-member panel can either validate Mahama's win or order a re-run. Few expect violence either way.

"It will be a 7-2 (split) decision, or at worse 6-3 in favor of Mahama," said Seth Gyekye, a political analyst at the Accra-based Futures think-tank.

Gyekye said evidence provided by the NPP party suggested the need for better training for election workers rather than a reversal of the result.

Ghana is home to one of Africa's fastest growing economies and is expected to see 8 percent economic growth in 2013.

However, the need to hold another vote would be a blow to efforts to control its budget deficit, which ballooned to 12.1 percent during the 2012 election year, nearly twice the target.

Mahama took over as president last year when incumbent John Atta Mills died in office. The smooth transition reinforced Ghana's reputation for political maturity in a region better known for its coups and violent post-election crises.

Voting in the 2012 poll was fraught with delays after hundreds of newly-introduced electronic fingerprint readers failed.

The non-partisan Coalition of Domestic Election Observers (CODEO), which had more than 4,000 people across the country, said the vote had been generally free and fair.

Margaret Boateng, a lawyer and human rights advocate, said she believed the evidence presented in court left no other option but to re-run the vote.

However, a senior lawyer who has followed the case but asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the opposition argument had most probably failed to convince the court.

"The status quo is likely to remain because the opposition only proved their case to some extent, but not enough to reverse last year's declaration by the electoral commission," he said.

Experts say calls for radical election reforms are inevitable.

Ghana's police force has been readied to deal with trouble, but few anticipate problems on the scale of the crisis that gripped neighboring Ivory Coast, where a contested 2010 election led to post-election violence that killed 3,000.

Both Mahama and Nana Akufo-Addo pledged to accept the ruling and have asked their followers to do same.

95 war.

The crimes stretch back over the past decade and illustrate how criminals from across Bosnia's ethnic divide have managed to work together while ethnic bickering on the political level has stalled the country's bid to join the European mainstream.

They include three armed attacks on security vans transporting bank cash and a raid on a post office in the capital, Sarajevo, in which robbers made off with a total of $6.8 million.

The perpetrators used police vehicles and uniforms to disguise themselves. Among the 32 indicted are three former police officers.

The indictments stem from a police sweep that began in September last year, codenamed Lutka (Doll).

Twenty-five were arrested in September last year and more followed over next 12 months. Most are in custody and some are free on bail.

"With this indictment, five grave, unresolved murders in East (mainly Serb) Sarajevo have been clarified, as well as several robberies that had been unexplained for years," the prosecutor's office said in a statement.

"The indictment is among the most extensive indictments relating to organized crime cases in post-Dayton Bosnia and Herzegovina," it said, referring to the 1995 U.S.-brokered peace deal in Dayton, Ohio, that ended the Bosnian war.

The accused appeared to be mainly Bosnian Serbs and Bosniaks (Muslims). Several were citizens of neighboring Serbia, the statement said.

Operation Lutka initially targeted alleged Balkan crime boss Naser Kelmendi in connection with the 2007 murder of a Sarajevo former warlord. Kelmendi fled and was arrested in May this year in his native Kosovo on a warrant issued in Bosnia.

Kelmendi, an ethnic Albanian with Bosnian citizenship, is on a U.S. list of suspected international drug kingpins. He remains in custody in Kosovo as the two countries do not have an extradition agreement.



headline: Turkey sends aid workers trained for chemical attacks to Syria border
byline: By Humeyra Pamuk
5:56pm EDT

Turkey has sent extra aid workers trained to identify and decontaminate chemical weapons victims to its border with Syria after an apparent poison gas attack in Damascus a week ago which may lead to Western military action.

"We have increased our measures significantly since last week, to be prepared particularly in case of a chemical attack," Mustafa Aydogdu, spokesman for the Disaster and Emergency Management Directorate (AFAD), said.

"We have experts who could deal with chemical attacks and we have deployed almost all of them in Kilis, Hatay and Sanliurfa," he said, naming Turkish border cities that house dozens of refugee camps.

Turkey, which has a 900-km (560-mile) border with Syria, hosts half a million refugees from the two-and-a-half year conflict and is braced for a new influx should Western powers strike.

Aydogdu said a number of refugees crossing into Turkey in recent days via Cilvegozu, the nearest border gate to the Syrian city of Aleppo, had burns and were being tested for chemical weapons exposure.

Syria's opposition coalition said on Tuesday that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces had dropped phosphorus bombs and napalm on civilians in rural Aleppo on Monday.

"We can't say at this stage that these burns are due to a chemical attack. We have heard about the use of phosphorus but I can't confirm as yet that people who have been subject to a chemical attack have crossed into Turkey," Aydogdu said.

U.N. chemical weapons investigators crossed Syria's front line into rebel-held territory on Wednesday for a second visit to the scene of the poison gas attack near Damascus.

U.S. President Barack Obama and his European and Middle East allies have blamed Assad for last week's killing of hundreds of civilians and are drawing up plans for punitive military action.

Turkey has emerged as one of Assad's most vocal critics and has been a staunch supporter of the rebels. It has spent around $2 billion sheltering refugees, according to Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan.

Turkey's near two dozen camps are home to about 200,000 refugees, Aydogdu said, while the rest live in rented accommodation in border cities.

He said new capacity was being built. "We can host another 20,000 people in our camp in Viransehir, near the border. There is no capacity problem at this stage."

headline: Ballooning costs threaten Merkel's bold energy overhaul

6:20pm EDT

Angela Merkel's "green revolution" risks becoming a victim of its own success.

Seduced by generous subsidies, Germans are embracing the ambitious project with such fervor - installing solar panels on church roofs and converting sewage into heat - that instead of benefiting from a rise in green energy, they are straining under the subsidies' cost and from surcharges.

Merkel's ambitious experiment to wean Europe's biggest economy off nuclear and fossil fuels is being closely watched around the world. Should it work, others will follow. But her priority if, as expected, she wins a third term on September 22 will be finding a way to cap the rising cost of energy.

"Germany's dilemma is how to keep industry's energy prices low enough to remain competitive and meet ambitious (green) targets while also maintaining a balanced budget," said Will Pearson, head of global energy at the Eurasia Group in London. "Addressing these will pose a political challenge."

So attractive are the incentives, or feed-in tariffs, that the rapid expansion of renewable power has driven up the surcharges which fund them and are paid for by consumers. The charge rose by 47 percent this year alone.

Both households and industry are feeling the pain and exporters complain that the energy shift has driven up power prices so much that their competitiveness is being eroded.

Cost worries aside, polls show broad public support for the shift, announced by Merkel after Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011. Responding to public fears, she accelerated Germany's nuclear exit and introduced targets for renewables to make up 35 percent of the power mix by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.

Given that consensus, the struggling opposition finds it difficult in the election campaign to present energy policies that differ significantly from those of Merkel's conservatives.

No one advocates a dismantling of the project.

"The energy transformation is a bit like putting man on the moon - it offers Germany huge opportunities for future decades. I have nothing against the idea," said Peer Steinbrueck, the Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for chancellor. "But Mrs Merkel is messing up the implementation and we will change that."

The SPD, which introduced the first incentives for green energy more than a decade ago when it ruled with the Greens, wants to help consumers by cutting energy taxes.

GRASS ROOTS

While politicians squabble over how to keep a lid on costs - put at 1 trillion euros ($1.34 trillion) in the long run by the environment minister - voters are taking matters into their own hands.

Take projects like GruenEnergie, a scheme launched two years ago by city utility Stadtwerke Guetersloh in western Germany under which the local cooperative bank and turbine maker Enercon each match citizens' investments in a nearby wind park.

After just three weeks, it had raised enough, mainly from locals offering between 1,000 and 25,000 euros, to fund a park which produces power for 2,400 households a year. The project has expanded to buy a solar park in eastern Germany.

"Customers are motivated by an investment in green energy which is considered trendy," said the utility's head of energy services, Uwe Poeppelmann.

Such grass-roots activism is, say experts, one of the most striking results of Merkel's energy shift.

Some 1.3 million solar photovoltaic units are on stream, mostly owned by single households, and about 23,000 wind plants have been bought, mainly by groups of farmers who club together.

However successful she has been at fostering a new culture, Merkel would face tough decisions in a third term: namely how to reform a subsidy system which is a victim of its own success.

Households take a direct hit on their electricity bills and do not expect this year's jump in the surcharge to be the end of it - creating a source of anxiety for voters.

"Surveys show people are concerned that the costs of the energy transformation will drive down living standards," said Emnid pollster Klaus-Peter Schoeppner.

INDUSTRY ANGRY

Export-oriented German industry, already disappointed that shale gas is being shunned due to environmental fears, is angry about high energy costs, although exemptions help many firms in the cement, steel, paper and glass sectors.

Although wholesale power prices have plunged by about a fifth this year due to renewable supplies, end users have to pay the second highest prices in Europe thanks to fees and charges.

"Energy-intensive industry, which employs over 900,000 people, will have to leave Germany in the medium term if it does not get sustainably competitive energy prices," said the head of the BDI industry association last month.

Utilities like E.ON and RWE, hit by plunging prices for wholesale power which they sell, are also piling on pressure to reduce green incentives. Some have threatened to shut thousands of megawatts worth of plants unless there is a big rethink.

Merkel, who has promised to change but not abolish the incentive system right after the election, faces a delicate balancing act to ensure renewables continue to grow and keep consumers happy. Much will depend on her coalition partner.

If she renews her alliance with the business-friendly Free Democrats, who want a radical overhaul of the Renewable Energy Law, deep cuts to feed-in-tarifs may come. But if she switches to a "grand coalition" with the SPD, her scope may be smaller.

Whether her next coalition is centre right again or centre left, Merkel is set to scale back exemptions from the renewable surcharge and grid fees, as the European Union has urged.

She also needs to boost offshore wind, which was meant to be part of the energy switch but has proved costly, and the power grid needs to be expanded by up to 4,600 km and overhauled to cope with bursts of supply from renewables. But some local communities fiercely resist more power masts. ($1 = 0.7466 euros)



headline: Syria's chemical weapons program was built to counter Israel
byline: By Anthony Deutsch and Khaled Yacoub Oweis
6:20pm EDT

Syria, defeated by Israel in three wars and afraid its arch enemy had gained a nuclear arsenal, began in earnest to build a covert chemical weapons program three decades ago, aided by its neighbors, allies and European chemical wholesalers.

Damascus lacked the technology and scientific capacity to set up a program on its own, but with backing from foreign allies it amassed what is believed to be one of the deadliest stockpiles of nerve agent in the world, Western military experts said.

"Syria was quite heavily reliant on outside help at the outset of its chemical weapons program, but the understanding now is that they have a domestic chemical weapons production capability," said Amy Smithson of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Washington, an expert on nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.

With Syria's civil war in its third year and more than 100,000 dead, chemical weapons are reported to have been used multiple times by the government of President Bashar al-Assad, most recently in Damascus suburbs on Aug 21.

Opposition activists have said at least 500 people, and possibly twice that many, were killed that day by rockets carrying the nerve gas sarin or something similar. Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi said the allegations were "illogical and fabricated".

A team of chemical weapons experts from the United Nations has been in Damascus for more than a week to establish whether chemical weapons including sarin and other toxic nerve agents have been used in Syria's conflict, and on Wednesday was making its second visit to a site of the Aug 21 attacks.

Meanwhile, the United States and its allies are gearing up for a probable military strike against Syria as punishment for the strike, which they blame on Assad's government.

As a result of the wars of 1967, 1973 and 1982, Syria sought to counter Israel's military superiority.

Non-conventional weapons have already been used in the region. The late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons such as mustard gas and other nerve agents during the 1980s, including the killing of 5,000 Kurds in Halabja, during the war with Iran.

Syria's ally Iran is accused by the West of seeking to develop an atomic bomb, which it denies, while Israel refuses to confirm or deny whether it has nuclear weapons.

"Syria had to have something to stack up against Israel," Smithson told Reuters.

Syria is one of only seven countries not to have joined the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which commits members to completely destroying their stockpiles.

Syria does not generally comment on its chemical weapons, but in July last year it acknowledged for the first time that it had them. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi told a news conference the army would not use chemical weapons to crush the rebels but could use them against foreign forces.

LOSING CONTROL

While it is relatively easy to produce small amounts of chemicals, scaling up to megaton quantities of precursors needed for weapons of mass destruction requires long-term, industrial-grade processing facilities with advanced equipment.

The first technology and delivery systems were most probably obtained from the Soviet Union and pre-revolution Egypt, military experts believe, while chemical precursors came from European companies.

To boost its own capabilities, Damascus set up the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC), an agency with a civilian figure head that was run by military intelligence.

It is "the best-equipped research center in Syria, possessing better technical capacity and equipment than the four Syrian universities," the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a leading non-proliferation group, wrote in May.

The SSRC, attacked by rebels and Israeli airstrikes earlier this year, oversees chemical weapons facilities in Dumayr, Khan Abou, Shamat, and Firaqlus, according to the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies. It set up facilities for blister agent, sarin, mustard and VX nerve gas, the Center said.

The agency is now headed by one of Assad's top advisers, national security chief Ali Mamlouk, said Brigadier General Mustafa al Sheikh, a Syrian army defector.

"The man overseeing the chemical weapons in general is Ali Mamlouk, but effective control of the weapons is becoming fragmented," Sheikh, who served for almost two decades in chemical weapons units, told Reuters from an undisclosed location in northern Syria. "Assad himself has lost overall command and control."

Mamlouk, on a list of Syrians targeted by EU sanctions since 2011, was promoted last year to head national security after its chief was killed in a bombing in Damascus. Considered to be a member of Assad's inner circle, Mamlouk is one of two Syrian officers indicted last August in Beirut for allegedly plotting to incite sectarian violence in Lebanon. Efforts to reach Mamlouk for comment were unsuccessful.

Sheikh said the arsenal is now in the hands of chemical weapons-trained loyalists of Assad's Alawite clan, a Shi'ite offshoot sect, and is being used for limited attacks that have killed dozens of rebels.

"Most of the chemical weapons have been transported to Alawite areas in Latakia and near the coast, where the regime has the capability to fire them using fairly accurate medium range surface-to-surface missiles," Sheikh said.

Some chemical munitions remain in bases around Damascus, and have been deployed with artillery shells. "It is a matter of time before fairly large warheads are used," he said.

A U.S. official, asked about Sheikh's comments, told Reuters: "This is one concerning scenario we're taking a close look at."

There are also fears that chemical weapons could fall into the hands of militants seeking to destabilize the region.

ILLEGAL SUPPLIERS

The bulk of chemical and biological weapons production technology came from "large chemical brokerage houses in Holland, Switzerland, France, Austria and Germany," said Globalsecurity, a security information provider.

In the early 1980s, Syria mostly imported French pharmaceuticals, some of them so-called "dual use" chemicals, which could also be used for chemical weapons, it said.

A wide range of industrial chemicals with legal applications, such as in agriculture, are also precursors for chemical weapons. The most important precursors for sarin, the nerve agent believed to have been used in recent fighting in Syria, are methylphosphonyl difluoride and isopropanol.

None of the reports cited named specific companies as suppliers. Syria has said it intended to use the chemicals for agriculture.

Securing raw chemicals on the international market became more difficult in 1985, when suspect sales were restricted by the Australia Group, a 40-nation body that seeks to curb chemical or biological weapons through export controls.

Some experts say Damascus obtained supplies from Russia and Iran instead, but Syria may also have turned to a network of illegal traders using front companies to sell to Iran and Iraq.

Former Russian general Anatoly Kuntsevich was suspected of smuggling precursor chemicals to VX gas to Syria, according to Globalsecurity. He died in 2002.

While questions remain about the origins of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, an evaluation by the U.S. government in March leaves little doubt about the threat it poses.

"Syria's overall chemical weapons program is large, complex, and geographically dispersed, with sites for storage, production, and preparation," the Director of National Intelligence wrote.

It "has the potential to inflict mass casualties, and we assess that an increasingly beleaguered regime, having found its escalation of violence through conventional means inadequate, might be prepared to use chemical weapons against the Syrian people."

headline: Son of Chinese general denies gang rape, inflames public anger
byline: By Sui-Lee Wee
6:20pm EDT

The teenage son of a prominent Chinese general denied the charge of gang rape on Wednesday, inflaming public anger in a case that has stirred resentment against the offspring of the political elite who are widely seen as spoilt.

Li Tianyi, 17, is one of five accused of assaulting a woman in a Beijing hotel in February, according to state media.

Li has become the most prominent target of complaints that the sons and daughters of China's top-ranked Communist Party officials can dodge the law because of family influence.

Li's father is General Li Shuangjiang of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), who is a singer known for performing patriotic songs on television shows and at official events.

Li's mother, Meng Ge, is a famous singer in the PLA.

At a closed-door trial, Li said he was drunk and had no knowledge of the alleged assault, two Beijing-based state-run newspapers said on their microblogs.

Dozens of journalists as well as supporters of Li and the victim gathered outside the court in northwestern Beijing. Police officers dragged away one of Li's supporters after she was seen talking to a reporter.

Two women stood in protest outside the court, holding signs that said: "Protecting the rights of mothers, females and young girls" and "Believe in justice".

Li's denial generated a torrent of criticism online.

"The Li family continues to challenge the intelligence of normal people. They're using despicable, rogue means to acquit Li," said a microblogger. "If a heavy sentence is not imposed, it will not satisfy the people's resentment."

The case has dominated headlines for weeks, focusing attention again on China's political aristocrats who are widely viewed as corrupt and above the law.

It follows the dramatic trial of ousted former senior politician Bo Xilai, whose family's lurid excesses were detailed by the court and lapped up on social media.

Li's legal adviser, Lan He, told reporters that lawyers hoped for a fair trial.

"Celebrities are also citizens and should not be held to ransom because of emotions," he said in a question-and-answer session with bloggers on Tuesday. "A moral judgment cannot replace justice."

It is not Li's first brush with the law. In 2011, he drove a BMW into another car in Beijing, beat up the couple inside the vehicle and then scoffed at bystanders about calling the police.

He was sentenced to a year in a juvenile correctional facility and his father made a public apology.

"The general public is worried that his family, because of their relationships and power, will be able to use their connections," said Zhang Ming, a politics professor at Renmin University.

"In China, this kind of privilege is very powerful. It's omnipresent," Zhang said. "The people's fears are not groundless."

On Wednesday, "Li Tianyi" was the second-most searched topic on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, with his name generating 9.7 million search results.

In July, hackers attacked the website of one of the law firms representing Li, saying: "We just want to return justice to the client."

President Xi Jinping has made addressing discontent over abuses by officials a main goal. Rising mistrust of the government presents a potent risk for leaders who fear social instability.

Even the People's Daily, the party's mouthpiece, weighed in on Li's case when it broke, saying the failure of prominent families to educate their children could "lead to antagonism among the people".



headline: Israel's Arab Bedouin citizens feel betrayed by eviction plan
byline: By Noah Browning
6:20pm EDT

Kian's dusty village of Atir has never existed on any official map, and now it is disappearing before his eyes.

For decades he and his fellow Arab Bedouins eked out a meager existence in the Negev desert, largely under the Israeli government's radar. But soaring property costs and a housing crisis are driving a new appetite in Israel for land and development opportunities, and even the harsh Negev looks good.

Israel has already invested around $5.6 billion to construct military bases in the Negev and will build 10 new communities there. The Bedouins will have to make way, a plan they say shows that Arabs are second-class citizens in Israel and is a betrayal given their past efforts to help build up the state.

The bulldozers have already been through Atir, demolishing homes and orchards, but Abu al-Kian, 70, refuses to leave.

"For 41 years I worked on this land, in the fresh air, for the Ministry of Agriculture and the Jewish National Fund, planting trees and putting out forest fires," he said, wearing a white scarf on his head cinched with a black cord.

"I have citizenship, but they still destroyed my house. Now I have only the shirt on my back. It's like they're saying to me, 'Just leave and go to hell'," he said, his voice shaking.

The majority of Israel's 1.6 million Arab citizens dwell in cities and small towns in the north and center. But 200,000 Bedouins live in the southern desert, half in government-built townships and half in 42 ramshackle "unrecognized" villages without running water, electricity or sanitation.

A draft law, which will likely come to a final vote after parliament returns from recess in October, expects to have to move some 40,000 Bedouins from many of the unrecognized villages into the seven townships, although some villages will stay.

The "Prawer Plan" will compensate many Bedouin with a combination of land and cash and bring them into "the 21st century" by significantly improving their standard of living, according to a government-sponsored report on the draft.

The Israeli position is that developing the region provides an opportunity to address the needs of a long neglected segment of the population.

"We are determined to narrow the gap (between the Negev and the rest of the country)," spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mark Regev, told Reuters. "They are citizens of Israel and are entitled to all the opportunities associated with being citizens."

ALIENATING THE COMMUNITY

Wadi Na'am, an unrecognized village like Atir, lies down a sunblasted stony track a short drive from the heart of the Negev "wine route", with leafy Jewish-owned ranches that are popular weekend destinations for wine and cheese tasting.

Sitting in his small, concrete home, which a generator-powered fan labors in vain to cool, electrician and village council member Najib Abu Bneiyeh says Israeli policies are alienating the community.

Unlike the Arabs of the cities and the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, the Bedouin traditionally shied away from political activism and have volunteered in small numbers for Israel's army, gaining renown for using ancient tracking skills to guard Israel's frontiers.

"Many of us used to volunteer for military service," Abu Bneiyeh said, looking at the yellowing pictures on the wall of relatives in combat fatigues. "But with the pressure we're put under, the demolitions and the acts of racism we experience, the Arabs are doing this less and less."

One complaint is that the committee drawing up the Prawer Plan, named after top Israeli planning official Ehud Prawer, had no Arab members and did not formally consult with the local representative body of the unrecognized villages.

"If the government were to recognize their villages, it would be obligated to provide services," said Ofer Dagan of the Negev Coexistence Forum, a civil rights group.

"But the only way modernization is offered to the Bedouin is through urban settlements, whereas the Jewish population is allowed a range of rural and agricultural modern settlements."

On August 1, hundreds of people staged protests against the plan at a junction near one of the townships, waving Palestinian flags to show solidarity with those in the occupied territories whom they see as fellow victims of Israel's appetite for land in the form of expanding Jewish settlements.

"We are part of the Palestinian nationality as well as citizens of the state of Israel, but the Prawer Plan is depriving our youth of a future," Abu Bneiyeh said.

"We see that they're forcing us to move without giving us a say in how and where we can live, so the protests are a way of resisting."

TOWNSHIPS

The Bedouins of the Negev, called Naqab in Arabic, are descendants of the semi-nomadic Arab tribes that once roamed the desert expanses, herding and farming.

Unemployment, crime, the high school drop-out rate and female non-participation in the work force are much higher in the community than in Israeli society at large.

Over two-thirds of Negev Bedouin lived below the poverty line in 2007, over four times the rate of Jewish households, according to the National Insurance Institute.

In the seven state-recognized townships, 16.2 percent unemployment stood at more than double the national average and only about 2 percent points lower than in the unrecognized villages, the Israeli Employment Service found in 2009.

Netanyahu's spokesman Regev acknowledged that previous governments had not done enough to raise the living standards of the Bedouin and said building up the Negev would benefit all Israeli citizens.

"The Negev as a whole is underdeveloped in comparison to the rest of the country, and as part of the billions of shekels being invested into it, the government has budgeted affirmative action programs which will bring health care, infrastructure and education to the Bedouin community," he said.

The government-sponsored report on the feasibility of the Prawer Plan said the "vast majority" of Bedouins in the illegal villages would not be much affected because the government would recognize some villages, while residents of others would be moving just "several hundred meters" into a township.

"By moving to a formal settlement ... families will make it possible for their children to leap in time into the midst of the 21st century," said the report by former minister Benny Begin. "Their destitution is accompanied by social problems that demand a comprehensive solution."

Israel's outlook can feel distant from the reality of Segev Shalom, a Bedouin township of around 8,000 where the green grass and palm trees planted in the main road median quickly give way to flat dusty expanses, trash fires and groups of idle youths.

"It's like a warehouse, a dormitory where people just sleep at night and then go off to jobs on the outside by day," said Khalil al-Jraibieh, who works in a small state-funded organization that gives job training to young people.

"When we look at the Prawer Plan, which we totally reject, we see it as another racist law in a state built on racism."



headline: German foreign minister urges Russia to back U.N. resolution on Syria
headline: Japan's Kono urges PM Abe to stop being coy over war dead shrine
byline: By Linda Sieg
6:20pm EDT

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should clarify whether he will visit a Tokyo shrine seen in much of Asia as a symbol of Japan's past militarism if he really wants to improve ties with China, a former moderate leader of Abe's party said on Wednesday.

Chinese anger over Japanese politicians' visits to Yasukuni Shrine, where Japanese leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal are honored, has strained ties already fraught over a dispute over tiny islands in the East China Sea.

The conservative Abe wants to restore Japan's pride in its past and ease the U.S.-drafted, pacifist constitution's restraints on the military.

The prime minister also says he is keen to improve ties with China. But China has brushed aside his calls for a summit as "grandstanding".

Abe sent a ritual offering to Yasukuni on the August 15 anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War Two. But, as usual, he declined to say if he would make a pilgrimage in future.

"If he is not going to Yasukuni Shrine, he should say so," Yohei Kono, a former head of Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), told Reuters in an interview.

"Now he just says he won't say whether or not he will go, so even if Japan makes a proposal, China and South Korea cannot respond. On the one hand, he says the window is open (for dialogue), but leaves unclear whether he will visit the shrine or not, so they are afraid to step through the window."

Relations between Japan and South Korea are also frayed by rows over wartime history and disputed isles.

Twenty years ago this month Kono, then Japan's top government spokesman, put his name to a statement apologizing for the involvement of Japan's military in forcing "comfort women", as they are known in Japan, to work in wartime brothels. Most of the women were Asian, many Korean.

The statement has been the target of criticism by Japanese ultra-conservatives, who argue there is no proof of direct involvement by the government or military in human trafficking.

SPIRIT OF THE CONSTITUTION

Abe has questioned the so-called Kono Statement in the past. But recently, under pressure from security ally Washington, he has dropped suggestions his government might alter those official remarks or tamper with a 1995 apology by then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.

Kono said frequent remarks by Japanese politicians at odds with official apologies over the war eroded international trust in Japan.

"To be seen as a country which simply says what is expedient at the time, that alters mid-stream what should be maintained and forgets or ignores past promises is certainly a minus for Japan," said Kono, who also served as foreign minister.

Kono also criticized Abe's push to revise or reinterpret Japan's U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution, seen by Japanese conservatives as a document forced on the country and out of tune with the current security environment including a rising China and unpredictable North Korea,

"We must at all costs preserve the spirit of the constitution at the time it was drafted - that we will never go to war, that we will not use force to resolve international disputes," he said. "It is not possible to cope with such changes (in the security environment) with force.

"We should do so through diplomacy."

Kono, who retired from parliament four years ago, is typical of the moderate conservatives who were once a significant force in the long-dominant LDP but who have lost ground as it tilted right. The party staged a comeback in December after three years out of power and cemented its grip in a July upper house poll that ended a deadlock in parliament.

Kono said there were still moderate LDP lawmakers but they were wary of speaking out under Abe's leadership. "I'm at a loss," he said. "When I look at the results of that upper house election, what I am saying might seem like grumbling by one of a few people off in a corner."

headline: Shortage of female security forces could keep Afghan women from vote

6:20pm EDT

Women across Afghanistan risk being unable to vote in next year's presidential elections because of a severe shortage of women in the security forces, the country's election monitor said on Wednesday.

Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission (IEC) said that there were just 2,000 of the required 12,000 women needed to carry out body searches required for voters entering polling stations set aside specially for women.

Voting is segregated as the two sexes are not permitted to mingle in public in conservative Afghanistan.

The shortfall of women staff is one of the greatest challenges facing the government ahead of the vote, planned for April 5.

"This is a really important issue for the IEC. We must have the same opportunities for male and females," IEC spokesman Noor Mohammad Noor said.

Recruiting women into the police force was considered an important victory for Western efforts to promote equality after the toppling of the hardline Islamist Taliban in 2001.

However, a Reuters report late last year found the aspirations of Afghanistan's female police force have been poisoned by a steady stream of taunts, molestations and even rapes by their male colleagues.

Recruitment has proved slow and numbers remain far below President Hamid Karzai's target of 5,000 women by the end of 2014.

To make up for the election day shortfall, the Ministry of Interior is considering training female teachers to carry out searches at polling stations, the IEC said.

The Ministry of Education was prepared to "help in any way possible", a spokesman said, though it was unclear whether the plan was workable.

Election officials encountered similar problems at the 2009 presidential poll, with female staff present at only 30 percent of polling stations set aside for women.

No figures for turnout of female voters are available, but officials say the numbers were very low, except in central Bamiyan province and areas in the country's north. In some areas in the less secure south and southeast, officials and international observers reported that almost no women voted.

Even if the ministry finds and trains the 10,000 women needed to secure polling stations, in Afghanistan's most conservative provinces hardly any women have registered to vote.

"We have been visiting homes and trying to get women together to explain why voting is important, that they have a voice and despite government corruption their vote does matter," said Neda Khaihani, a member of the provincial council in Baghlan in the north.

"We've been working for months and only have eight women registered at the moment."

headline: Detente on Korean peninsula as Pyongyang seeks to lift isolation
byline: By Jack Kim
6:20pm EDT

un is reaching out to Seoul and Washington after months of threats to try to mend his country's broken economy in a move that appears to have vindicated, for now, the policies of his South Korean counterpart.

Kim, the third of his line to rule North Korea, may release jailed U.S. missionary Kenneth Bae in the coming days after agreeing to reopen a joint industrial zone with South Korea and to hold reunions between families that were torn apart by the 1950-53 Korean War.

To be sure, experts are not predicting lasting peace between the two Koreas since Kim has shown no sign of giving up his banned nuclear weapons program.

But Kim and South Korean President Park Geun-hye could have found some common ground after they were both buoyed domestically by their hardline stances earlier this year when the North threatened the South with war.

"North Korea appears to have made up its mind to improve ties during Park's term," said independent political commentator Yu Chang-seon. "Park herself has to have on her mind her father's aspirations for unification that he never realized."

Park is the daughter of Park Chung-hee, the military ruler who is credited with building modern South Korea. She has a single five-year term in which to leave a legacy that in some way measures up to her father's.

She met Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, in 2002 in a move that some credit as paving the way for better ties, such as the reunions of separated families, which began the following year.

"She is one of those rare people who met with Kim Jong-il and spoke at length," Yu said. "That is quite a significant experience and is just the kind of thing that can provide for a dramatic improvement in South-North ties."

Park has a generally favorable public rating six months into her presidency, thanks largely to support for her North Korea policy, according to a poll published this week.

Sixty percent of a survey of 1,000 people by the mainstream Chosun Ilbo newspaper published on Monday agreed with her policy of not backing down in the face of North Korean threats while persistently trying to engage in dialogue.

That is a sharp shift from her conservative predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, who sought to isolate Pyongyang after a North Korean guard shot and killed a South Korean tourist at a jointly run resort in 2008 and the North's military sank a South Korean naval vessel and shelled an island in 2010.

Park took office in late February and was immediately tested by North Korea, which had carried out its third nuclear test a couple of weeks earlier and then embarked on a two-month long period of saber rattling, threatening the United States, South Korea and Japan with nuclear war and missile strikes.

North Korea's puny economy and isolation under heavy U.N. sanctions means it is rarely taken seriously on the diplomatic stage unless it reminds the world of its willingness to engage in combat or of its capacity to push nuclear proliferation.

Typically, periods of tension are followed by engagement, with North Korea again turning its attention to an economy that is 45 times smaller than the South's and dependent on China for much of its trade and aid.

"Park Geun-hye's policy is working because the North is isolated after the provocations under Lee Myung-bak and its missile and nuclear tests," said Hong Sung-gul, who teaches government administration at Kookmin University in Seoul.

BUILDING TRUST

Park sketched out her vision of engagement with North Korea before taking office in a policy she dubbed "trustpolitik", an echo of West Germany's approach to East Germany before German reunification in 1990.

She pledged to respond strongly to any military action by the North but said she was willing to commit to better commercial ties in return for a dialing down of tensions.

"For now, the path for the so-called trust process appears quite smooth, with Kim Jong-un stressing economic rebuilding, for which political stability is crucial," said Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.

Park's government has given the go-ahead for private aid groups to send supplies such as medication, clothing and blankets to North Korea for its children and disabled people.

The North has also made overtures to Washington by inviting a special envoy, Robert King, to visit Pyongyang on Friday.

That could lead to the release of Bae, a Korean American Christian missionary who was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in April after a court convicted him of state subversion.

The court said Bae, 45, used his tourism business to form groups aimed at overthrowing the government. Bae was detained in November as he led tourists through the country's northern region.

Another Korean American who was detained in North Korea for six months was released during a 2011 visit by King to assess the country's pleas for food aid.

The endgame for Park is highly unlikely to be a permanent thaw in relations or reunification.

"The ultimate goal for the North is to get around international sanctions," said Jang Sung-min, a former legislator and aide to ex-President Kim Dae-jung, who ushered in warmer ties with his Sunshine Policy in the early 2000s.

"Kim Jong-un has his nukes with the third nuclear test, which he says has given the country a deterrent from outside aggression. The focus is the economy."

Yu, the political commentator, said Park's North Korea policy has the basis to be broader in support and impact if it succeeds, unlike those of liberal leaders Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun who were criticised for "buying" better ties with aid.

"Park will be pursuing a policy largely backed by the country's conservatives. If it works, it has the makings of a very broad policy success," Yu said.

6:20pm EDT

Australia's conservative opposition, heavily favored in next month's election, outlined A$31 billion ($27.8 billion) in savings on Wednesday and promised to breathe new life into the economy by abolishing environment taxes polarizing voters.

But Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the opposition planned big cuts to key services and predicted voters would return to his Labor Party in the final week of campaigning. Most polls give the opposition under Tony Abbott a 53 to 47 percent lead, enough to give them a sizeable majority in parliament.

Opposition finance spokesman Joe Hockey, who would become treasurer of the world's 12th biggest economy if the polls prove true, said the conservatives were determined to better Labor's spending record, seen as one of Rudd's biggest electoral weaknesses.

"After six years of Labor getting every single budget number wrong, enough is enough," Hockey told reporters. "The coalition is absolutely committed to living within its means."

Labor, he said, had presided over a "dysfunctional" budget after ousting the conservatives in 2007.

The opposition has long made the abolition of a "carbon" tax on pollution and a tax on mining company profits the cornerstone of its bid to drive Labor from office, blaming the carbon tax for pushing up the price of electricity and other services.

VOTERS CONCERNS OVER BUDGET CUTS, JOBS

But budget cuts and their impact on jobs amid a slowdown remain a major concern among many of the 14 million voters. An Australian National University survey found jobs and management of the A$1.5 trillion economy to be the most important issue.

Rudd told a campaign event that Abbott planned in secret to "cut, cut and cut" health and education programs, austerity measures that could hurt confidence and propel the country into its first recession for a generation.

"He is the master of the big cuts," the prime minister said.

He predicted Labor would make a big comeback despite the polls, as it did in the 1993 election.

"Mr Abbott thinks he's a shoo-in," Rudd said. "I think the Australian people don't like political leaders who arrogantly assume that they have their vote already in the bag."

Hockey, a former financial markets lawyer, went out of his way to say there would no cuts in social spending.

The conservatives, he said, would deliver a centerpiece promise of a A$9.8 billion paid parental leave scheme, paid for in part through abolition of business compensation associated with the carbon and mining taxes to be eliminated. A further A$5.2 billion would be saved by axing 12,000 government jobs.

As well, the opposition would keep savings adopted by Rudd in a pre-election budget statement that lowered growth forecasts to 2.5 pct from 2.75 pct this fiscal year, and forecast the jobless rate rising to 6.25 percent.

The one exception would be Labor's cuts to tax breaks for the automotive sector, still struggling to adjust to the Australian dollar's high levels in recent years and local costs which prompted a pullout this year by Ford, he said.

In response to the weakening economy, the Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 2.5 percent, while a A$33 billion drop in tax revenue saw a forecast budget deficit this fiscal year of $A30.1 billion, returning to a A$4.0 billion surplus by 2016-17.

Global demand for iron ore, coal and other natural resources supported the economy for most of the past decade, but falling commodity prices and slowing growth in China, the country's top export market, have rattled confidence.

Hockey said the conservatives would more quickly wind back net government debt, now expected to peak at 13 percent of GDP by 2014-15, or A$212 billion, up from the May forecast of A$191.6 billion, or 11.4 percent of GDP in 2014-15.

"This is the most important election in a generation," he said.



headline: China accuses Briton, American of illegally buying private data

China has accused two risk consultants, a British man and his American wife, of illegally buying and selling private information, state media reported on Tuesday, in what could be a widening crackdown on obtaining data for commercial purposes.

Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng were detained in Shanghai on July 10. They have since been formally arrested, which typically means police believe they have enough evidence for a case to be brought to trial.

Police in Shanghai had arrested 126 people this month alone in a crackdown against the illegal collection of personal information, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement on the case involving Humphrey and Yu.

It did not give details on the nationalities or professions of those arrested, or say precisely what they had done.

But the detention of Humphrey and Yu has already had a chilling effect on other risk consultants working in China, with some corporate investigators saying they had become more cautious about which projects to accept, avoiding any the government might see as sensitive.

Multinationals, banks and investors rely on corporate investigators for information about potential partners and investments in China, where a lack of transparency is a hurdle to doing business.

A police investigator in Shanghai, Lu Wei, said on state-run CCTV the couple "wantonly" obtained a lot of information on home registrations, international travel and property records.

They sold the information to lawyers, multinationals and financial institutions, CCTV said.

Humphrey said in a statement broadcast on CCTV that he had occasionally used illegal methods.

"I sometimes used illegal means to obtain personal information," Humphrey said in Mandarin to a camera as he sat handcuffed wearing an orange vest.

"I very much regret this and apologies to the Chinese government," said Humphrey, who worked as a journalist for Reuters in the 1980s and 90s.

BRITON'S FIRM DID WORK FOR GLAXOSMITHKLINE - SOURCES

ChinaWhys, the investigative risk consultancy Humphrey and Yu founded, worked for many firms including British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), sources familiar with the matter have said.

Chinese police have been investigating bribery accusations against GSK since July, although Chinese media reports on Humphrey and Yu made no mention of the firm.

GSK has declined to comment on the work ChinaWhys did for the company except to say that Humphrey is not, nor has he ever been, an employee.

In a statement, Britain's foreign office expressed concern at Humphrey's appearance on state TV.

"We were concerned to see that Peter Humphrey was interviewed about the details of a case which is currently under investigation and has yet to come to trial," the foreign office said, adding it was continuing to provide consular assistance to Humphrey and his family.

The American embassy could not immediately be reached for comment.

Jason Cai, a Chinese investigator who worked with Humphrey and Yu, was arrested around the same time, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Cai was not mentioned in the state media reports, and his arrest has not been announced.

The ChinaWhys website says Humphrey has worked as a risk management specialist and corporate detective for 14 years.

Cai Hua, a Chinese criminal lawyer, said it was difficult to say how heavy the penalty would be if the couple is convicted.

"For the most part, it rests on the extent of the damage the crime has done and the amount of information obtained," said Cai, who is not related to Jason Cai.

The couple "confessed to the crime without concealing anything," the official Xinhua news agency said. " actions seriously violated the personal privacy of Chinese citizens."

"Whether it's a Chinese person or foreigner engaging in illegal activities, public security organs will firmly crack down without holding back," the news agency said.

led strategy of his predecessor.

Pena Nieto took office in December vowing to take a different tack in Mexico's raging drug war. Former President Felipe Calderon tried to tame drug bosses with a military assault, but it was widely seen as a failure and more than 70,000 people died in drug-related violence.

Pena Nieto originally promised a 40,000-member gendarmerie, or militarized police force, that would take the lead in tackling violent crimes like extortion and kidnapping as the marines and army gradually returned to their barracks.

The aim was to move the command away from Mexico's complex network of poorly paid security forces, which have been easy targets for the cartels to infiltrate and corrupt.

The government has since said the armed forces will remain active in the fight against drug gangs because the death toll has remained stubbornly high. The gendarmerie will be much smaller and patrol mainly rural areas to safeguard the passage of people and goods.

"The gendarmerie will be a division of the federal police, made up of 5,000, who will begin their mission in July 2014," Manuel Mondragon, the government's national security commissioner, said at a security meeting with Pena Nieto.

He said the government had modified its plan after taking into account the opinions of community leaders and academics. Mondragon said 1,710 members of the gendarmerie had been hired so far.

Pena Nieto, who has tried to shift public attention away from the violence toward Mexico's economic potential, said the number of murders between December and July this year had fallen by 20 percent compared with the same period last year.

Still, about 1,000 people have died each month in drug violence since Pena Nieto took office, official data show.

Some analysts say little appears to have changed between the two administrations.

"It's starting to look like same-old, same-old," said Sylvia Longmire, a former agent with the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, who now works as a drug war analyst.

"The military is still out there, the gendarmerie is not taking shape as he originally planned ... and he's still going after the big fish."

The government has captured a number of kingpins, including the head of the Gulf cartel and Miguel Angel Trevino, leader of the ultraviolent Zetas, last month.

Critics argue Calderon's strategy of going after drug bosses backfired because cartels fragmented in the ensuing power-struggles, ratcheting up the blood-letting.

The Mexican military is still involved in regular clashes with the cartels in sparsely populated areas across the country, displacing local residents and leading others to take up arms in vigilante groups.

"The main question in my mind is, 'do they know what they're doing?'" said David Shirk, director of the Trans-Border Institute and a drug war specialist, calling the gendarmerie a "gimmick."

"Do they have a well thought-out strategy that they're trying to employ? Or are they figuring out things as they go?"

The United States will send its North Korean human rights envoy to Pyongyang this week to seek the release of an imprisoned U.S. Christian missionary, the State Department said on Tuesday.

Robert King, special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, will travel to Pyongyang on Friday at the invitation of the government on a "humanitarian mission focused on securing the release of U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae," the department said in a statement.

King will ask North Korea to "pardon Mr. Bae and grant him special amnesty on humanitarian grounds so that he can be reunited with his family and seek medical treatment," it added.

The White House urged North Korea on Tuesday to grant Bae clemency and allow him to return to the United States.

The release of Bae, which would remove an irritant in U.S. relations with North Korea, also would fit into a recent pattern of conciliatory steps by Pyongyang toward its neighbors.

In April, Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after North Korea's Supreme Court convicted him of state subversion. The court said Bae, 45, used his tourism business to form groups aimed at overthrowing the government.

Bae was detained in November as he led a tour group through the northern region of the country. His sentencing came amid acrimonious relations between Pyongyang and Washington over the reclusive state's nuclear program.

Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told Reuters on August 10 that her brother had been held at a prison for foreigners and put to work plowing and planting fields.

He was transferred to a state hospital because he suffered from a range of health problems, including an enlarged heart, chronic diabetes as well as back and leg pain, she said.

North Korea has used the release of high-profile American prisoners as a means of garnering prestige or recognition, rather than economic gain, by portraying visiting dignitaries as paying homage to the country and its leader.

That pattern has complicated the response from U.S. lawmakers and the State Department, which has called for Bae's immediate release on "humanitarian grounds," but had resisted sending high-profile envoys to negotiate.

Reports last month that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was set to visit North Korea to negotiate for Bae were denied.

In an Internet petition urging President Barack Obama to secure "special amnesty" for his father, Jonathan Bae wrote: "We have been distraught by my father's deteriorating health and his sentence of hard labor. However, we have not given up hope because we have faith in our government to represent and protect American citizens here and abroad."

King has experience negotiating in the reclusive state, which has sought to use imprisoned foreigners as high-profile bargaining chips.

Jun Young Su, an American citizen detained in North Korea on unspecified charges for six months, was released during a May 2011 visit by King to assess its pleas for food aid.

Jun was arrested and admitted committing a crime "against the state" following an investigation, North Korea's official KCNA news agency reported. Media reports said the California businessman had been doing missionary work in North Korea, which said he would be released on "humanitarian grounds."

Two American journalists arrested in 2009 by North Korea were held until former President Bill Clinton traveled there to negotiate their release.

"Many people will read too much into. What we've seen over the decades is that North Korea alternates between belligerent threats and even aggressive actions and charm offensives," said Bruce Klingner, a Senior Research Fellow for Northeast Asia at The Heritage Foundation.

In dispatching King, rather than a more prominent diplomat or former U.S. president, the State Department weighed the well-being of a citizen against gestures that might undermine its policy toward a bellicose state, Klingner said.

Earlier this year, North Korea threatened to stage nuclear attacks on the United States, among other military actions.

Rick Larsen, a U.S. congressman from Washington state, where Bae's family lives, has called for Bae's release.

"Kenneth's family has waited in anguish and uncertainty, but has never wavered in their tireless advocacy on his behalf," Larsen said in a statement.

Assad was behind the chemical weapons attack near Damascus this month.

Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican, said he has looked into the August 21 attack and spoken to U.S. government intelligence analysts and operators, but his committee did not receive a formal consultation from President Barack Obama's administration, despite the seriousness of the issue.

"I believe that evidence exists that is convincing, if not compelling, that the administration of Syria, the government of Syria, was involved in launching those attacks," Rogers told Reuters. "I do not believe that it was a single source person deciding to do it. I believe it came from the (Syrian) administration."

Rogers, whose committee oversees the U.S. intelligence community, said it would be very difficult to determine if Assad had ordered a chemical weapons attack, but such a move would likely involve at least his close associates.

"They have a very tight hold on their military. From what we know, historically, about how their chemical weapons units work, it is a fairly flat line to the office of the president in Syria. So there are not a lot of people that can intercede in that and make it happen," Rogers said.

The "direction has to come from a pretty small group of people connected to the president" for a chemical weapons attack, he said.

Rogers would not comment on any specific pieces of intelligence, nor on what type of chemical weapon is believed to have been used.

The White House said the options being considered to respond to the chemical weapons attack do not include the ouster of Assad. A U.S. intelligence report is expected to be released in coming days.

One of the options that Obama is weighing is cruise missile strikes against Syrian targets, officials have said.

Secretary of State John Kerry, in a forceful statement on Monday about chemical weapons use in Syria, said there was "additional information about this attack" and it was being compiled and reviewed.

Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the administration may be waiting for more clinical analysis of tissue samples from the scene.

"It's clinical analysis of the tissue samples that have been gathered, it's the evidence that has been obtained by the U.N. team, and by some of the non-governmental organizations that are treating patients there - I think that's a big piece of what the administration is waiting on," Schiff said.

"We have obviously our own intelligence. We have the insights of our regional allies and their intelligence agencies, and a lot in the public domain in terms of these videos. But I think the piece that I haven't seen yet is the clinical piece," he told Reuters.

Rogers said he did not know what additional information Kerry was referring to.

"We do our own independent look, but I have had no formal consultations with the administration on what they are claiming now is new information. I have not had that," Rogers said.

"Informal status updates should not pass as consultation with Congress," he said. "Calling an individual member on an unsecure line - that doesn't count."



headline: Colombia's Santos open to talks with FARC leader Timochenko
byline: By Helen Murphy
3:59pm EDT

Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said on Tuesday he would consider meeting FARC rebel leader Timochenko to accelerate talks aimed at ending 50 years of conflict but warned the nation will continue at war if Colombians reject what is agreed at the negotiating table.

Santos, who started peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, back in November, said the time for peace is "now or never" but reiterated that any negotiated agreements must be ratified by popular vote.

In an interview with local radio, Santos said he is willing to meet Timochenko, whose real name is Rodrigo Londono, in pursuit of peace so that the Andean nation can move into a different phase of stability and economic development.

"I think this is the most important process that Colombia can have and, if it's successful, the most important thing that can happen to Colombia in recent history," Santos told W Radio, referring to the talks hosted by Cuba.

"So if there's a need at some point, for the process to be successful, that a meeting takes place, I won't rule it out," he said when asked whether he would meet with the FARC leader.

More than three dozen FARC commanders are in Cuba working through a five-point agenda that would let the two sides declare an end to the fighting that has killed more than 200,000 since it began in 1964. The war has pit the FARC and a smaller rebel group, the ELN, against government troops and illegal paramilitary death squads.

Timochenko is not personally taking part in the negotiations and his exact whereabouts are unknown. He is thought to be coordinating the war from hiding in Venezuela.

Santos last week sent draft legislation to congress that would seek to ratify any deals signed in Havana through a referendum that would coincide with national elections next March or May.

VOTERS GET FINAL SAY

If the voters do not like the way peace is achieved and how it would impact the nation, the accords would be moot, Santos said.

"In that case there wouldn't be a peace process; so simple, we'd continue at war," he said, acknowledging that talks may stretch beyond November, the date he sees as ideal.

While most Colombian support the peace process, many doubt they will soon reach a successful end. Opposition leaders like former President Alvaro Uribe are furious that Santos may be giving too many concessions to the FARC in order to cement his legacy.

The FARC has battled a dozen governments since it began as an agrarian struggle against rural inequality. Even while it has been severely weakened in the past 10 years by a heavy U.S.-backed offensive, the leftist guerrilla movement remains a formidable threat to the government and civilian population.

In recent months, the FARC has sought to boost its political sway in rural areas, supporting labor disputes and backing road blocks that have piled pressure on the government.

Santos asked Colombians to take little heed of what the FARC says on the sidelines of talks since the agenda was firmly set ahead of time.

The latest demand from the rebels came on Tuesday from Cuba and called for citizen involvement in economic decision making. They want one of the seven members of the central bank board, which sets interest rates, to be elected by popular vote.

The official agenda includes rebel participation in politics, an end to the conflict, how to eliminate the drug trade, reparations for victims, and agrarian reform - on which the two sides have reached partial accord.

The rebels have said repeatedly they do not want a referendum on peace and insist on a constituent assembly as the best way to enshrine the tenets of the accords in the nation's constitution.

Any meeting between Santos and Timochenko would be the first such sit down since former President Andres Pastrana met rebel founder Manuel Marulanda during peace talks that fell apart in 2002.

Timochenko, who was trained in irregular warfare in Cuba and politics in Russia in the 1980s, took over as head of the Marxist FARC after Colombian forces killed former boss Alfonso Cano in late 2011.

Colombia's attorney general has put out at least 117 capture orders against Timochenko for kidnapping, murder, rebellion and terrorism while the United States has offered up to $5 million for information leading to his capture.

headline: Colombia's ELN rebels free Canadian geologist
byline: By Helen Murphy
6:20pm EDT

Colombia's ELN rebels freed a Canadian geologist they had held captive for seven months on Tuesday, meeting one of the demands by President Juan Manuel Santos to enable the start of peace talks with the insurgent group.

Jernoc Wobert was seized on January 18 in northern Bolivar province along with two Peruvian and three Colombian miners contracted by the Toronto-based Braeval Mining gold mining company. His colleagues were later freed by the leftist ELN, or National Liberation Army, the smaller of two rebel groups fighting the government for almost five decades.

Wobert was released in a rural area to a mission of the International Committee of the Red Cross and has been examined by a doctor, said ICRC spokesman Jordi Raich in a statement.

Santos has conditioned any peace talks with the ELN on freeing Wobert and all other captives it holds in the nation's jungles. ELN leaders have expressed interest in starting peace negotiations similar to those currently under way with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

It is not known how many hostages the group holds.

"We hope that this effort contributes to a healthy exchange and support for peace in Colombia," ELN leader Nicolas Rodriguez said in a video posted on the group's website. He said the release was a humanitarian gesture.

The ELN, which is against mining by foreign companies in Colombia, pledged to free Wobert after Toronto-based Braeval said last month it would no longer mine in the area where he was kidnapped. The company did not link the decision to Wobert's capture.

Efforts to rid Colombia of its reputation as one of the most dangerous places to do business has led to a rush of investment into areas that were once off-limits.

Colombia, a nation of 47 million people, has attracted record foreign direct investment in recent years as troops push the guerrilla groups deeper into inhospitable jungles.

While oil and mining companies have been able to work in more remote and dangerous areas in recent years, the risk to employees continues. Both the ELN and FARC have stepped up attacks on the infrastructure this year, hitting oil pipelines and power lines repeatedly.

The ELN has battled a dozen governments since it was founded in 1964 and is considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union.

Inspired by the Cuban revolution and established by radical Catholic priests, the ELN was close to disappearing in the 1970s but gradually regained strength. By 2002 it had as many as 5,000 fighters, financed by "war taxes" levied on landowners and oil companies.

The ELN is now believed to have about 3,000 fighters. It has sought peace before, holding talks with the Colombian government in Cuba and Venezuela between 2002 and 2007. Experts say there was a lack of will on both sides to agree a final peace plan.

Assad's government.

Western powers have told the Syrian opposition to expect military action against Assad's forces soon, according to sources who attended a meeting between envoys and the Syrian National Coalition in Istanbul.

Amid a quickening drumbeat of preparations, U.S. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said American forces in the region were "ready to go" if President Barack Obama gives the order, as intelligence agencies assembled what is sure to be final confirmation of the Syrian government's culpability for Wednesday's poison gas attack near Damascus.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said it would "fanciful" to think that anyone other than Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces was responsible for the chemical attack, which killed hundreds of people as they slept.

Obama has yet to make a final decision on the U.S. response, Carney said, but left little doubt that it would involve military action. He insisted, however, that Washington was not intent on "regime change," signaling that any military strikes would be limited and not meant to topple Assad.

The British military was also drafting plans. Prime Minister David Cameron, anxious, like Obama, not to emulate the entanglements in wars in Afghanistan and Iraqi that beset their predecessors, said any strikes would be "specific" so as not to drag the allies deeper into the Syrian civil war now in its third year.

Cameron recalled parliament for a debate on Syria on Thursday.

U. N. chemical weapons investigators put off until Wednesday a second trip to the rebel-held suburbs of Damascus, where activists say hundreds of civilians died a week ago.

While evidence of chemical warfare could bolster an argument for intervention at the United Nations in the face of likely Russian and Chinese opposition, Western leaders and the Arab League have already declared Assad guilty.

Ahmad Jarba, president of the rebel Syrian National Coalition, met envoys from 11 countries at an Istanbul hotel, including the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford. The rebel leaders proposed targets for cruise missiles and bombing.

One participant said: "The opposition was told in clear terms that action to deter further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime could come as early as in the next few days."

Planning appears to focus on missile or air strikes. There is little public support in Western countries for troops to invade Syria.

"We have moved assets in place to be able to fulfill and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take," Hagel said.

The precise timing of possible military action remained unclear, but it is certain to wait for an official U.S. intelligence report blaming Assad's government for the chemical attack. The findings, considered merely a formality at this point, will be released this week, U.S. officials said.

Under growing pressure for U.S. action on Syria Obama is expected to keep close watch on the situation there, but he will go ahead with a speech on Wednesday at Washington's Lincoln Memorial marking the 50th anniversary of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream speech."

MOOD IN DAMASCUS

Syria's government, backed by Iran, denies gassing its own people and has vowed to defend itself, but residents of Damascus are growing anxious.

"I've always been a supporter of foreign intervention, but now that it seems like a reality, I've been worrying that my family could be hurt or killed," said a woman named Zaina, who opposes Assad. "I'm afraid of a military strike now."

"The big fear is that they'll make the same mistakes they made in Libya and Iraq," said Ziyad, a man in his 50s. "They'll hit civilian targets and then they'll cry that it was by mistake, but we'll get killed in the thousands."

Russia, Assad's main arms supplier, opposes military action and has suggested that rebel forces may have released the poison gas. China's state news agency recalled how flawed intelligence was used to justify the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Firm opposition from permanent members of the U.N. Security Council all but rules out a U.N. mandate of the kind that gave legal backing to NATO air strikes that helped Libyan rebels unseat Muammar Gaddafi two years ago. However, Western officials say they do want to act within international law.

Moscow and Beijing accuse Western powers of using human rights complaints, such as in Libya, to meddle in sovereign states' affairs. White House spokesman Carney insisted: "The options that we are considering are not about regime change.

"They are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons." Although Obama has long said Assad should step down, he is unwilling to commit to making that happen by force. Carney said it was "profoundly in the interests of the United States" to respond to the chemical weapons attack.

In Britain, Cameron told reporters: "This is not about getting involved in a Middle Eastern war or changing our stance in Syria or going further into that conflict. It's about chemical weapons. Their use is wrong and the world shouldn't stand idly by."

In France, which played a major role in Libya, President Francois Hollande said he was "ready to punish" Assad for using the chemical weapons, citing a 2005 U.N. provision for international action to protect civilians from their own governments.

Similar arguments were used by NATO to bomb Serbia, a Russian ally, after the killing of civilians in Kosovo.

In an indication of support from Arab states that may help Western powers argue the case for an attack against likely U.N. vetoes from Moscow and Beijing, the Arab League issued a statement holding Assad's government responsible for the chemical attack.

Fears of another international conflict in the Middle East affected financial markets. Oil prices hit a six-month high and stocks fell around the world, notably in Turkey, as well as in emerging economies that would suffer from a chill in trade.

The government of Turkey, a NATO member, called for action against Assad for what it called a "crime against humanity."

TOUGH CHOICES

Obama, Cameron and Hollande face questions at home about how a military intervention would end, whether they risk bolstering Assad if he rides out the assault and whether they risk handing power to anti-Western Islamist rebels if Assad were overthrown.

Turmoil in Egypt, where the 2011 uprising inspired Syrians to rebel, has underlined the unpredictability of revolutions. The presence of Islamist militants, including allies of al Qaeda in the Syrian rebel ranks, has given Western leaders pause. They have held back so far from helping Assad's opponents to victory.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said U.S. strikes would help al Qaeda and called Western leaders "delusional" if they hoped to help the rebels reach a balance of power in Syria.

"We have means of defending ourselves, and we will surprise them with these if necessary," he said. "We will defend ourselves. We will not hesitate to use any means available."

Assad's forces made little or no response to three attacks by Israeli aircraft earlier this year that Israeli officials said disrupted arms flowing from Iran to Lebanon's Hezbollah.

The presence of United Nations experts in Damascus may be a factor holding back international military action. The experts came under fire in government-held territory on Monday before reaching the rebel lines. They interviewed and took samples from survivors, though much evidence may have decayed.

Opposition activists have said at least 500 people, and possibly twice that many, were killed by rockets carrying the nerve gas sarin or something similar. If so, it was the worst chemical weapons attack since Saddam Hussein gassed thousands of Iraqi Kurds in 1988.

byline: By Sui-Lee Wee
3:59pm EDT

The teenage son of a prominent Chinese general goes on trial on Wednesday suspected of involvement in a gang rape in a case that has inflamed public anger at the offspring of the political elite who are widely seen as spoilt and reckless.

Li Tianyi, 17, is among five men accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a Beijing hotel in February, according to state media.

His father is General Li Shuangjiang of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), who is a singer known for performing patriotic songs on television shows and at official events.

Li's mother, Meng Ge, is a famous singer in the PLA.

It is not the teenager's first brush with the law. In 2011, he drove a BMW into another car in Beijing, beat up the couple inside the vehicle and then scoffed at bystanders about calling the police.

He was sentenced to a year in a juvenile correctional facility and his father made a public apology.

The latest case has dominated headlines for weeks, focusing attention again on China's political aristocrats who are widely viewed as corrupt and above the law.

It follows the dramatic trial of ousted former senior politician Bo Xilai, whose family's lurid excesses were detailed by the court and lapped up on social media.

Li has become the most prominent target of complaints that the sons and daughters of China's top-ranked Communist Party officials can dodge the law because of family influence.

"The general public is worried that his family, because of their relationships and power, will be able to use their connections," said Zhang Ming, a politics professor at Renmin University.

"In China, this kind of privilege is very powerful. It's omnipresent," Zhang said. "The people's fears are not groundless."

In July, hackers attacked the website of one of the law firms representing Li, saying: "We just want to return justice to the client."

"SUE ME!"

President Xi Jinping has made addressing discontent over abuses by officials a main goal. Rising mistrust of the government presents a potent risk for leaders who fear social instability.

Even the People's Daily, the party's mouthpiece, weighed in on Li's case when it broke, saying the failure of prominent families to educate their children could "lead to antagonism among the people".

The case has also stoked debate about rape and attitudes towards women.

In July, a law professor at the elite Tsinghua University apologized online after he had said that "raping a chaste woman is more harmful than raping a bar girl, a dancing girl ... or a prostitute", sparking outrage.

Li's lawyer, Chen Shu, told Reuters Li would not plead guilty but he declined to elaborate except to say the court was not expected to announce a verdict on Wednesday.

Li's lawyers have asked the court to investigate suspected prostitution and extortion relating to the case, Li's legal adviser, Lan He, was quoted by the state-run China News Service as saying.

The lawyer for the woman victim could not be reached for comment.

Family connections do not always help unruly offspring.

In 2010, a 22-year-old man was jailed for six years after he ran over a student and shouted "Sue me if you dare. My father is Li Gang!"

Li Gang was a deputy provincial police chief. His son's warning has become a byword for nepotism and corruption.

Libya's largest western oilfields closed when an armed group shut down the pipeline linking them to ports, its deputy oil minister said on Tuesday, reducing its oil output to a trickle.

war levels of around 1.6 million bpd, according to a Reuters estimate, the worst disruption since the civil war in 2011.

The fields - El Feel and El Sharara - linked to the pipeline have a combined capacity of around 500,000 barrels per day.

"I'm upset. This is something ridiculous. There is nothing to discuss, it's up to the defense ministry and guards to fix this," Omar Shakmak told Reuters.

The group were not protesting oil workers or dissatisfied Petroleum Facilities Guard members, as in eastern Libya, he said, meaning there were no concrete demands up for negotiation.

"It's a third party," Shakmak said, though he did not know who exactly or what they wanted.

In the east, striking workers, who had already cut Libyan oil output by over half, want more power for the eastern region, the oil minister said in a television interview earlier on Tuesday. Abdelbari al-Arusi said that output was at 665,000 bpd.

He blamed mainly non-oil workers and agitators pushing for federalism in Libya for the strikes, which he said had cost the country $2 billion in lost revenues.

Until the protests, improved oil production and higher prices had brought Libya a $3 billion revenue surplus over its target in the first half of this year, Arusi said.

Arusi said a prolonged strike could lead to a budget deficit: "If the strikes continue, we will reach very terrifying figures in losses."

"These groups announced federalism and they don't recognize the government nor the general national council," he said.

"These youths possess arms now and they have force, and by force they have prevented us from exporting oil and closed the ports," he added.

The strikers had contacted tankers to load oil, Arusi said, adding that international firms keen to maintain long-term ties with Libya and their reputation had rejected those advances.

"They brought some tankers outside the state to load them with oil to transfer the financial revenue to their own private accounts," he added.

"They contacted these oil firms, who got in touch with us and (asked) us whether they should deal with them. We told them they are illegal ... and so matters are under control and oil is in safe hands.

"These international firms do not want to tarnish their reputation," he said.

Arusi rebuffed strikers' assertion that independent oil sales would prevent corrupt officials within the government from selling crude for personal gain.

They accuse the national oil company's senior administration of selling oil without using measurements of quantity.

"There are meters at every field and everything is transparent," the minister said, adding Prime Minister Ali Zeidan had set up a commission of inquiry to look into such allegations.

CLOSED PORTS

The minister said the oil ports of Es Sider, Ras Lanuf, Zueitina and Marsa al Hariga, which are in the east where most of the country's oil production lies, remained closed.

Only Marsa al Brega in the east was open.

Brega loaded its first crude oil tanker since August 9 over the weekend.

"The oil ports are completely closed. Brega was recently opened and Zueitina and Hariga are still closed. Every port has a different reason for their closure," the minister added.

He warned that a prolonged hiatus in exports would allow other producers, such as fellow OPEC member Saudi Arabia, to step in, depriving Libya of revenue and even possibly forcing it to sell oil at a discount to restore former customers.

"This has led to a loss of credibility in the international market ... Saudi Arabia has the ability to up production. Why do we deprive ourselves of these much-needed financial resources for reconstruction?"

Police seized a painting of Russia's president and prime minister in women's underwear from a gallery in St Petersburg, saying the satirical display had broken unspecified laws.

The officers also removed a picture of the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, his torso covered in tattoos, and two others poking fun at lawmakers who have backed legislation banning so-called gay propaganda, gallery staff said.

The police service said it had taken paintings from the "Museum of Power" gallery - based in two rooms of a flat - late on Monday after receiving reports they were illegal.

It gave no further detail but Russia does have a law against insulting authorities - an offence that carries a maximum one-year prison term.

One painting showed president Vladimir Putin wearing a tight-fitting slip and brushing the hair of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who is wearing knickers and a bra.

St Petersburg deputy Vitaly Mironov, whose face was combined with the gay rights movement's rainbow flag in one of the paintings, told Reuters the images were inappropriate and "of a distinctly pornographic character".

St Petersburg, which next week hosts world leaders at a G20 summit, was one of the first Russian cities to introduce a law banning the spread of "gay propaganda".

The Russian parliament has also adopted similar legislation, prompting protests from abroad and calls for a boycott of the Winter Olympics which Russia will host in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in February.

Gallery owner Alexander Donskoy said the officers had also shut down his establishment and have him no explanation for the removal of paintings from the exhibition, titled 'Leaders'.

"This is an (illegal) seizure," he told Reuters. "We have been given no formal documents banning us from operating and no receipt confirming our petty cash was seized."

headline: Iran names new envoy to IAEA, extending makeover of nuclear team
byline: By Yeganeh Torbati
6:20pm EDT

Iran has named a disarmament expert as its envoy to the U.N. nuclear watchdog, extending a reshuffle of top officials dealing with its disputed atomic program since new President Hassan Rouhani took office vowing to improve Iran's foreign relations.

Rouhani has yet to pick someone for arguably Iran's most important diplomatic post - chief nuclear negotiator with world powers - but the pragmatist tilt of his team so far points to a closer alignment of nuclear and foreign policy.

Reza Najafi, who has worked on disarmament issues within Iran's foreign ministry, will be its next ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, ISNA news agency said on Tuesday.

Najafi replaces Ali Asghar Soltanieh, who has been leading so far fruitless negotiations with the IAEA since early 2012 and was the ambassador during the hardline conservative tenure of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

The U.N. agency wants to resume a long-stalled investigation into suspicions that Iran has carried out research relevant for nuclear weapons development, an allegation Tehran denies. Western diplomats accuse Iran of stonewalling the IAEA inquiry.

Rouhani, a relative moderate, has pledged to smooth Iran's relations with world powers to help ease stringent international sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program. Iran says it is enriching uranium only for civilian energy and medicine. The West suspects the program is covertly oriented towards developing a nuclear weapons capability.

Earlier this month Rouhani appointed former foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi, seen as a relative pragmatist, to head Iran's atomic energy organization, a position he held before, replacing a conservative hardliner.

Vienna diplomats say the exit of Soltanieh, a strident conservative whose relations with the IAEA became tense, may be a further sign of Rouhani's desire for a fresh start with the outside world on nuclear issues.

Rouhani has vowed Iran will be more transparent and less confrontational in talks both with the IAEA and the big powers.

TONE NEW, SUBSTANCE NOT

But diplomats caution that it remains unclear whether Tehran's new tone will translate into substantive change, given that Rouhani has signaled no change in the Islamic Republic's insistence on the right to enrich uranium without restriction.

Little is known about Najafi's politics. But the state run English language Press TV said that as the head of Iran's atomic energy organization in 2010, Salehi tried to replace Soltanieh with Najafi at the IAEA, describing Najafi as "an expert in non-proliferation issues" who "deserves the post". But Soltanieh's term was ultimately extended.

Mark Fitzpatrick, director of non-proliferation and disarmament at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that when Najafi attended an IISS conference in 2010, he engaged with other participants during the breaks, listened well, asked good questions and defended Iran's interests but was not above correcting himself.

ISNA said Najafi was nominated by new Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, a U.S.-educated former U.N. ambassador, for the IAEA post and Rouhani approved it.

For the pivotal post of chief nuclear negotiator, it is nearly certain that Rouhani will replace Saeed Jalili, a hardline ideologue of the Islamic Revolution who diplomats said spent more time lecturing than engaging with major powers.

A new head of the Supreme National Security Council, who has traditionally acted as chief nuclear negotiator, has yet to be appointed. The delay has raised speculation that Rouhani may be trying to win over power brokers in the clerical and security elites to shifting the job to the foreign ministry, a less hardline institution in Iran's multi-tiered power structure.

While the president can appoint a new head of the council, the fact it comprises representatives of government, parliament, judiciary, armed forces and clerical Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei makes it harder to settle on a negotiating line.

headline: South Africa strikes escalate with petrol stations dispute
byline: By Ed Stoddard and David Dolan
6:20pm EDT

South Africa's petrol station and car dealership workers on Tuesday announced a strike for higher wages next week, signaling more labor disruption to a struggling economy also facing stoppages in gold mines.

Africa's largest economy is facing a wave of wage increase demands and strikes by increasingly militant workers, renewing a challenge to President Jacob Zuma after violent mines strikes last year dented growth and led to sovereign credit downgrades.

Citing escalating living and transport costs, leading manufacturing union NUMSA said its 72,000 members working in petrol stations, automotive retail shops and car dealerships would walk out from Monday "in demand of a living wage and improved conditions".

The petrol station and car dealership employees will join workers from the auto industry who have already downed tools for a week in a wage dispute, costing the economy an estimated $60 million a day.

Strikes also started this week in the country's construction and airport sectors, but their impact has been limited so far.

"Workers are no longer willing to be subjected to starvation and poverty wages," the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) said in a statement announcing the strike from Monday. It said wage talks with employers had reached deadlock.

Jakkie Olivier, chief executive of the Retail Motor Industry Organisation, which has been in negotiations with NUMSA, said talks were still going on and the strike plan was "totally irresponsible".

More worrying for South Africa's faltering economy is the looming prospect of stoppages in the gold and platinum mines, where unions demanding pay increases of between 60 and 150 percent appear on collision course with producers battling rising costs and falling metals prices.

On Saturday, the main mining union NUM gave bullion producers, including AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Sibanye Gold and Harmony Gold, a seven-day ultimatum to meet its demand for pay rises of up to 60 percent or face strikes.

At current spot prices, a gold industry stoppage would cost the economy an additional $35 million in lost output daily.

"NOT TRIGGER-HAPPY"

Frans Baleni, head of the main mining union NUM, held out a slight hope on Tuesday that a compromise could still be found with gold producers before the Friday deadline.

happy about a strike," Baleni, General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), told Reuters on the sidelines of a mining conference in Johannesburg.

"We have said: let the employers put something on the table ... If it was something reasonable then I am sure our members would consider it," Baleni added, indicating that NUM would be open to some kind of counter-offer by the companies.

The Chamber of Mines, which is negotiating on behalf of the gold producers, made a "final offer" on Tuesday of basic wage increases of between 6 and 6.5 percent, slightly above the projected inflation rate for 2013.

The offer was promptly rejected by NUM, indicating a wide divide between labor and employers, who have said they can ill afford the union pay demands.

Kgalema Motlanthe, deputy president in Zuma's African National Congress government, expressed sympathy on Tuesday for the mineworkers. He said the industry had for years under white-minority rule "developed methods of making super-profits by relying on the super-exploitation of unskilled workers.

"Sadly, the mining industry has remained a prisoner of its apartheid past in this core element of cheap labor sourced through a migrant's punishing annual work cycle and all the social evils associated with that cycle," he told the mining conference. Apartheid ended in 1994.

The ongoing and threatened strikes are expected to further hit South Africa's growth prospects, even though the country registered an acceleration of growth in the second quarter thanks to a robust expansion in manufacturing.

GDP expanded 3.0 percent quarter-on-quarter, the highest figure for a year, Statistics South Africa said on Tuesday.

Despite this upbeat number, the rand hovered near the four-year lows it plumbed last week over news of the start of the auto industry strike and the threatened gold industry stoppage.

The quarterly growth figure, which undershot economists' expectations of 3.3 percent, was largely due to a one-off bounce from the manufacturing sector, which grew 11.5 percent in the second quarter on a recovery in base metals.

Manufacturing is the second biggest sector in the South African economy. The industry's expansion in the second quarter was the highest since the first quarter of 2011, according to Stats S.A.



headline: Britain drafts military plans for Syria, recalls parliament

Assad.

Stressing he had not yet taken a decision either way, Cameron condemned last Wednesday's reported chemical attack in the suburbs of Damascus as "ghastly".

"This is not about getting involved in a Middle Eastern war or changing our stance in Syria or going further into that conflict," Cameron told reporters in his first public comments on the matter. "It's about chemical weapons. Their use is wrong and the world shouldn't stand idly by."

Cameron's decision to recall parliament came after his spokesman said plans were being drawn up for possible military action. It sets the stage for a tough debate on Thursday that will end in a vote, the outcome of which remains uncertain.

The result is likely to depend on the wording of the motion, and government sources said Cameron would need to work hard to convince doubters across the political spectrum.

He used his official Twitter feed on Tuesday to say any response had to be legal, proportionate and specifically to deter the use of chemical weapons.

Many lawmakers in Cameron's governing Conservative party are skeptical about the idea of military intervention after what they regard as costly and unsuccessful operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Nick Clegg, the leader of Cameron's junior coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats, indicated he agreed with Cameron, saying Britain wanted to send "a clear signal" that the use of chemical weapons was "simply intolerable".

"What we are not considering is regime change, trying to topple the Assad regime, trying to settle the civil war in Syria one way or another. That needs to be settled through a political process," said Clegg.

Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour party, met Cameron on Tuesday. He said afterwards his party would consider supporting military action as long as it had clear and achievable military goals.

NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

Cameron cut short his holiday to return to London and will chair a meeting of Britain's National Security Council on Syria on Wednesday. He is expected to keep talking to other world leaders to ensure any response is coordinated.

Writing in The Times newspaper, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who ordered British troops into Iraq and Afghanistan, said the West had to stop its "hand-wringing" and act.

A failure to intervene would leave Syria "mired in carnage" as a more dangerous breeding ground for extremism than Afghanistan in the 1990s, he said.

General David Richards, the former Chief of Britain's Defence Staff, told The Sun newspaper the scale of involvement to make a decisive difference was so huge it was not something that Britain could "sensibly contemplate" at the moment.

Cyprus' foreign minister said he did not expect a British airbase on the Mediterranean island to play a major role in any military strike, while a government spokesman said he could not comment on British reports the bases would be used.



headline: Tunisia PM says state must stay strong amid jihadi threat

5:56pm EDT

Tunisia's Islamist Prime Minister Ali Larayedh said on Tuesday he was ready to step aside for a caretaker cabinet to hold new elections, but would not create a power vacuum while the country faced serious security and economic challenges.

He said this after announcing Tunis had proof the jihadist group Ansar al-Sharia had assassinated two secular politicians and killed eight soldiers in recent months and so had now officially classified it "as a terrorist group".

Larayedh, speaking amid intense speculation about the future of democracy in the birthplace of the Arab Spring revolts, said the drafting of a new constitution must be finished and all parties must agree on the election plan before he stepped down.

"We are not playing politics with the security of the country," he told a news conference, anticipating the reaction that promptly came from opposition critics who have long accused his Islamist Ennahda party of being lax with Muslim radicals.

"I am ready to step down if that can resolve the problem," he said, referring to a stalemate paralyzing Tunisian politics since the second assassination this year and the killing of eight soldiers near the Algerian border, both in July.

"But we think a caretaker government would not be the best solution in this critical phase on the security and economic fronts," he said. "The government has to continue to work in a disciplined way until a consensus is achieved."

Tunisia, struggling to save its nascent democracy amid popular discontent and the Egyptian army's ousting of the Muslim Brotherhood government there, has seen mounting pressure on the unpopular Ennahda party to step aside for new polls.

Rached Ghannouchi, the party chairman who shapes policy from outside the government, has accepted to negotiate with the opposition under the mediation of the powerful UGTT trade union federation but not revealed many details of his position.

Larayedh spelled out the government's four-point response to opposition demands that it quit immediately. He said his cabinet should stay in office to maintain state authority at the start of the transition.

The assembly elected in 2011 to write a new constitution should promptly resume its work, which was suspended in late July, and finish the document by October 23, he said.

FREE ELECTIONS

Tunisia's President Moncef Marzouki should consult all parties in search of a consensus on a caretaker government that can organize and hold free elections under the surveillance of international observers, he said.

"The government will leave when that dialogue arrives at a consensus," he said, without indicated how long that could take.

Larayedh said the reclassification of Ansar al-Sharia, whose main leaders have been sought for violent acts since December, would bar other members from holding meetings, preaching and agitating for sharia law as they have been able to do until now.

Ansar leader Saifallah Benahssine, also known as Abu Iyadh, is a former al Qaeda fighter in Afghanistan being sought by Tunisian police for allegedly inciting an attack on the U.S. embassy in Tunis in September 2012.

Four people were killed in those disturbances, which began as a protest over a film that mocked the Prophet Mohammad.

Ansar al-Sharia is the most radical Islamist group to emerge in Tunisia since secular autocrat Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled in 2011 in the first of the Arab Spring revolts.

It was the prime suspect after the assassinations of leftist secular leaders Chokri Belaid in February and Mohamed Brahmi in July, which police said were carried out with the same gun.

It was also suspected in the killing of eight soldiers, some of whose throats were slit, in the rugged Mount Chaambi area near the Algerian border in July.

The assassinations and killings of the soldiers plunged Tunisia into political turmoil late last month. The discussions and mediated contacts among politicians in recent weeks are aimed at breaking that deadlock and leading to new elections.

Ennahda, which governs in coalition with two smaller secular parties, has come under growing pressure from critics for promoting an Islamist agenda and mismanaging the economy and the security challenge from radical Salafi and jihadist Muslims.

seat majority in parliament as it struggles to revive a faltering economy.

John Godson, Poland's first black member of parliament, said he was leaving over disagreements about unspecified social issues - a move which could embolden over members of a conservative faction in the party.

Members of the grouping have already clashed with the more liberal Tusk over in vitro fertilization, civil partnerships for gay couples and other issues.

The government is still likely to be able to get a revision of the budget through parliament in the next few weeks, but the departure of Godson leaves it with a narrow margin for error on other important votes, especially a planned pension reform.

The conservative faction's de facto leader, Jaroslaw Gowin, lost a party leadership election last week to Tusk, but won a surprisingly high 20 percent of votes, signalling growing dissatisfaction with Tusk's leadership.

Civic Platform trails the main right-wing opposition party in opinion polls. A majority of Poles say they are unhappy with Tusk's handling of the economy, which earlier this year came close to the first recession in two decades.

Godson was facing disciplinary action by party managers for abstaining from a vote on a government-backed bill last month.

He said he was also quitting because he was unhappy with the prospect of disciplinary action.

"This is a private decision. And one of the best decisions I have ever made," Godson said.

Godson said he would stay in parliament as an independent and would probably not back a government bill to widen this year's budget deficit.

He said he would also oppose changes to the pension system planned by the government, but would back Civic Platform on other issues.

how to respond to shocking pictures of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria.

She is caught between overwhelming opposition from German voters to military action in Syria and pressure from international allies to back their calls for "consequences". Berlin's decision two years ago not to support Western intervention in Libya has intensified that pressure.

Merkel, tipped to win a third term in the September 22 vote although she may have to switch coalition partners, knows only too well how international crises can turn elections.

A clear "no" to U.S. plans for an invasion of Iraq in 2002 was widely seen as a crucial factor in handing a surprise victory to Social Democrat (SPD) Gerhard Schroeder.

Few experts think Merkel will depart radically from the traditionally cautious German stance on military action abroad - a pacifist strain that derives from the collective shame of having started World War Two and perpetrated the Holocaust.

A poll on Tuesday showed 69 percent of Germans were against a military strike in Syria and only 23 percent backed it.

However, the conservative Merkel and Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, a member of her Free Democrat (FDP) junior partners, ratcheted up the rhetoric this week.

Merkel's spokesman described the suspected use of nerve gas by government forces in Syria's civil war as "breaking a taboo", adding that a very clear international response was needed. He declined to speculate on possible military intervention.

The United States and its close NATO allies are drafting plans for air strikes and other action after the reported chemical attack which killed hundreds of Syrian civilians.

Assad, sources who attended the meeting told Reuters on Tuesday.

MORAL OBLIGATION

None of this means Germany will actually offer more than moral support and some logistical help, but it highlights a recognition that Berlin will be marginalized if it decides against standing by its allies, as it did in 2011 over Libya.

The top-selling Bild daily ran a story on Tuesday with the headline "Can we really keep out?" and offered the answer that it would be "difficult". It quoted a lawmaker saying Germany could not afford to isolate itself again after the Libya vote.

In 2011 Germany abstained in a U.N. Security Council vote on action against Libya, angering Washington and other allies.

Karl-Georg Wellmann, a member of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), spoke out for Western intervention in Syria.

"We can't look on passively at mass murder," he told Spiegel Online, saying a military signal was needed and that Berlin may give logistical or missile defense support.

Earlier this year, Germany sent Patriot missiles and about 300 soldiers to Turkey as part of a NATO mission to help protect its easternmost member state from war spillover from Syria.

In a sign that Germany wants to be involved in decisions now, its military chief of staff attended weekend talks in Jordan with alliance counterparts on the Syria crisis.

But pollsters say Merkel faces a delicate balancing act.

Peter Schoeppner told Reuters.

"But the government won't risk alienating the big majority against military action," he said.

The opposition SPD, trailing Merkel's conservatives by at least 15 points, hope to win votes by stressing the risks.

Their challenger to Merkel, Peer Steinbrueck, warned against behaving as if military action could end civil war and promote peace in Syria. SPD lawmaker Gernot Erler went even further, saying: "We must do everything to avoid a military escalation."



headline: Russia-Belarus potash dispute ignites diplomatic row

6:20pm EDT

billion global potash market into a major diplomatic row.

Vladislav Baumgertner, chief executive of the world's largest potash producer, was detained on Monday at the airport of the Belarusian capital Minsk after being invited to secret talks with Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich.

Television footage released by the Belarusian Investigative Committee, the former Soviet republic's top crime-fighting agency, showed Baumgertner being searched, his legs spread and hands against a wall. He was later pictured handcuffed.

President Alexander Lukashenko appears to have taken it as a personal affront when Uralkali quit a cartel last month with a Belarusian state firm producing potash, a fertilizer ingredient.

The main owner of Uralkali, which controls 20 percent of the world market, is Suleiman Kerimov, a billionaire with close ties to President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin administration.

Russia's Foreign Ministry summoned the Belarusian ambassador to issue a rebuke, warning of unspecified consequences for bilateral ties. The two countries allow passport-free travel and are members of a free-trade zone.

"It is impermissible to detain a person on his way home after he came for talks at the invitation of the Belarusian government," Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin told news agency Interfax.

Russia's ambassador to Minsk asked prosecutors on Tuesday afternoon to release Baumgertner. Officials said they would review the case, but stressed they were dealing with a crime that had inflicted severe economic damage on Belarus.

"We hope our partners will consider this question in the spirit of the law, not on the basis of emotions and political connections," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Savinykh.

Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has a history of maneuvering between Russia and Europe to shore up his isolated leadership and Soviet-style economy.

"Lukashenko loves trading hostages; he trades political hostages with the West and economic hostages with Russia," said Dmitry Oreshkin, an independent Russian political analyst.

Baumgertner, who faces up to 10 years in jail on charges of abusing his powers, could in effect be ransomed by Belarus in return for economic concessions by Russia, analysts speculated.

Uralkali Chairman Alexander Voloshin, a former Kremlin chief of staff, said he was outraged by the prosecution of Baumgertner. In a statement he said the charges "simply look clumsy" and that business disputes "must not be resolved in this way".

WHO BENEFITS?

The market for potash has long been dominated by a handful of players led by the Belarusian Potash Co (BPC), a marketing venture between Uralkali and state-owned Belaruskali.

Together with Canpotex - which groups North American firms Potash Corp, Agrium and Mosaic - BPC controlled 70 percent of sales, keeping prices high for farmers.

Angered by a law passed in Belarus last year allowing Belaruskali to sell product outside the marketing venture, Uralkali quit the cartel on July 30, saying it would seek to maximize its own volumes and warning prices could fall by as much as 25 percent this year.

The recriminations, and a threat by Belarus to hold Baumgertner for at least two months, suggest there is little hope of early reconciliation.

"I doubt that this is possible," said one Russian industry source familiar with the situation, adding the charges against the chief executive were "unjust - complete and utter rubbish".

The dispute could be good news for some, however.

"I don't think Uralkali and Belaruskali can come together again. It is sure that there would be cut-throat competition among suppliers, which is good for buyers," said a senior official at a leading Indian potash importer.

Uralkali's shares steadied after sharp falls on Monday that extended its losses since mid-July to more than a quarter. Among competitors, Germany's K&S; extended gains posted on Monday, when Potash Corp, Atrium and Mosaic also drew buyers.

GETTING PERSONAL

Although Russia's reprimand amounted to a standard demarche, indicating it may not want the dispute to escalate, relations in the post-Soviet area can quickly hit the buffers.

Russia fought a brief war against Georgia, another former Soviet republic, in 2008, and it has cut off gas supplies to Belarus and Ukraine - key pipeline routes to the Europe market - in arguments before.

Sources said Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who made way for Putin's return to the Kremlin last year, was furious after having been in personal contact with Minsk over Baumgertner's trip.

Playing hardball with Kerimov, whose fortune is estimated by Forbes magazine at $7.1 billion, is a risky proposition given his proven ability to mobilize political backing. It was Kerimov who forced out former Uralkali owner Dmitry Rybolovlev, the emigre owner of French soccer club Monaco, before completing a Kremlin-backed Russian potash merger in 2011.

Lukashenko's tactics amount to an attempt "to force Suleiman Kerimov into dialogue", said Yaroslav Ramanchuk, head of the Mizes think-tank in Minsk, warning that the definitive collapse of the cartel would cost Belarus $1.5 billion.

The state of 10 million people, sandwiched between Russia and Poland, can ill afford such a hit as widening external deficits threaten a repeat of a 2011 balance of payments crisis that forced a 65 percent currency devaluation.

"Belarus needs additional external financing, and the most likely source remains Russia," analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Under a $3-billion loan facility granted by a Moscow-led bailout fund, Belarus has to privatize $1.2 billion in assets to qualify for the disbursal of a $440 million tranche in November.

Assad would not be "so stupid" as to use chemical weapons close to Damascus, the leader of the country's largest Kurdish group said.

Saleh Muslim, head of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), said he doubted the Syrian president would resort to using such weapons when he felt he had the upper hand in the country's civil war.

He suggested last Wednesday's attack, which the opposition says was carried out by government forces and killed hundreds of people, was aimed at framing Assad and provoking an international reaction. Assad has denied his forces used chemical weapons.

"The regime in Syria ... has chemical weapons, but they wouldn't use them around Damascus, 5 km from the (U.N.) committee which is investigating chemical weapons. Of course they are not so stupid as to do so," Muslim told Reuters.

At the time of the incident, U.N. experts were already in Syria to investigate three previous alleged chemical attacks dating from months ago.

Muslim's PYD, which has well-armed and effective militias, has clashed with Assad's forces as well as rebels, but has allowed both to move through its territories during the war.

Some rebels and rival Kurdish groups accuse it of having been close to the state, a position Muslim disputes. He said Kurdish areas the PYD controlled were under attack from al Qaeda-linked rebels.

Muslim suggested "some other sides who want to blame the Syrian regime, who want to show them as guilty and then see action" lay behind the chemical attack, which has led to speculation that Western countries will order a military response.

He said that if the U.N. inspectors found evidence Assad was not behind the gassing and the rebels were, "everybody would forget it".

"Who is the side who would be punished? Are they are going to punish the Emir of Qatar or the King of Saudi Arabia, or Mr Erdogan of Turkey?" Qatar, Turkey and Saudi Arabia have all strongly condemned Assad and backed the rebels.

Kurdish militias have sought to consolidate their grip in northern Syria after exploiting the chaos of the civil war over the past year by seizing control of districts as Assad's forces focused elsewhere.

The PYD said in July it aimed to set up a transitional council and their emerging self-rule is starting to echo the autonomy of Kurds in neighboring northern Iraq.

Muslim said he reassured officials during talks last month with Turkey's intelligence agency that the council was not a move to divide Syria - which would alarm Ankara, which is wary of deepening sectarian violence on its border.

Nonetheless, it highlights Syria's slow fragmentation into a Kurdish northeast, mainly government-held areas around Damascus, Homs and the Mediterranean, and a rebel swathe leading from Aleppo along the Euphrates Valley to Iraq.

China has accused two risk consultants, a British man and his American wife, of illegally buying and selling private information, state media reported on Tuesday, amid a nationwide probe into the drugs industry.

The Briton, Peter Humphrey, and his American wife, Yu Yingzeng, were detained in Shanghai on July 10 as police investigated bribery accusations against British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

A police investigator in Shanghai, Lu Wei, said on state-run CCTV the couple "wantonly" obtained a lot of information on home registrations, international travel, and property records.

They sold the information to lawyers, multinational companies and financial institutions, CCTV said.

Humphrey said in a statement broadcast on CCTV that he had occasionally used illegal methods.

"I sometimes used illegal means to obtain personal information," Humphrey said in Mandarin to a camera as he sat handcuffed wearing an orange vest.

"I very much regret this and apologize to the Chinese government," said Humphrey, who once worked as a journalist for Reuters.

ChinaWhys, the investigative risk consultancy Humphrey and Yu founded, worked for many firms including GSK, separate sources familiar with the matter have said.

Chinese police have been investigating bribery accusations against GSK since July, though Chinese media reports on Humphrey and Yu made no mention of the firm.

"We were concerned to see that Peter Humphrey was interviewed about the details of a case which is currently under investigation and has yet to come to trial," Britain's foreign office said in a statement. "We are continuing to provide consular assistance to Mr Humphrey and his family."

The American embassy could not immediately be reached for comment.

Jason Cai, a Chinese investigator who worked with Humphrey and Yu, was arrested around the same time, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Cai was not mentioned in the state media reports, and his arrest has not been announced.

Shanghai police did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

The ChinaWhys website says Humphrey has worked as a risk management specialist and corporate detective for 14 years.

Cai Hua, a Chinese criminal lawyer, said it was difficult to say how heavy the penalty would be if the couple is convicted.

"For the most part, it rests on the extent of the damage the crime has done and the amount of information obtained," said Cai, who is not related to Jason Cai.

The couple "confessed to the crime without concealing anything," the state-controlled Xinhua news agency reported. " actions seriously violated the personal privacy of Chinese citizens."

"Whether it's a Chinese person or foreigner engaging in illegal activities, public security organs will firmly crack down without holding back," the news agency said.



headline: Italy coalition struggles for deal as tax showdown nears
byline: By James Mackenzie
6:20pm EDT

Italy's fractious ruling coalition struggled on Tuesday to bridge differences over a housing tax that threatens to create a new crisis for a government already severely strained by the legal turmoil surrounding Silvio Berlusconi.

With twitchy financial markets nervous about the prospect of fresh political instability in Italy, the Milan stock market fell for a second day and government borrowing costs rose ahead of a closely anticipated bond auction on Thursday.

Ministers are due to meet on Wednesday to decide what to do about the tax on main residences, which Berlusconi's center-right party insists must be scrapped if it is to continue supporting center-left premier Enrico Letta.

The housing tax has dogged Letta's unwieldy coalition of traditional rivals ever since it was formed after inconclusive elections in February left no party able to govern on its own.

Senior political leaders including Letta and President Giorgio Napolitano have warned that any threat to the left-right government's survival would risk a return to the kind of turmoil seen at the height of the euro zone debt crisis, when Italy, the bloc's third biggest economy, came close to a Greek-style meltdown.

But, despite some signs of progress including proposals to replace the tax with a new local services levy, there has been no firm agreement on where to find the 4 billion euros ($5.35 billion) a year it would take to abolish the tax.

"This is a fundamental policy issue," Renato Brunetta, a Berlusconi loyalist and lower house leader of his People of Freedom (PDL) party told RAI state radio.

"The fact that the government has so far failed to present a solid proposal has created a lot of doubt, it's not serious to proceed in this way," he said.

Coming on top of mounting tensions over Berlusconi's future in parliament following his conviction for tax fraud earlier this month, the battle over the housing tax has underlined the severe constraints on Letta in trying to reverse Italy's worst postwar recession.

OTHER PRIORITIES

On Tuesday Berlusconi told PDL hardliners to stop their open threats to pull out of Letta's coalition, boosting hopes that in the end a deal will be reached to avoid an immediate crisis.

However Letta's own center-left Democratic Party (PD) has so far rejected demands to scrap the housing tax, known as IMU, and instead proposed a partial abolition which would save most taxpayers but still hit richer Italians.

"Taking action on IMU has to be seen in a context where there are other priorities," Deputy Economy Minister Stefano Fassina told RAI radio, saying that Italy's strained public finances did not allow an across-the-board cut.

"We have limited room and various priorities. I would intervene clearly in the case of the vast majority of Italian families which pay IMU on their primary residence without going further," he said. "We need to find a point of balance."

He said scrapping the tax for 85 percent of Italians but taxing the remaining 15 percent would reduce the funding gap to 2 billion euros and allow the government to provide resources for other needs including unemployment relief.

The PDL made scrapping IMU a central plank of its campaign platform in the February election and has pressed for its abolition ever since the government was formed in April.

Reaching a deal on the housing tax has been complicated by the bitter dispute over Berlusconi's conviction and a vote within weeks in the Senate on whether to expel him from parliament and bar him from standing as an election candidate.

The PDL says it will be impossible to stay in the government if the PD keeps its vow to vote for his expulsion.

With Italy struggling to emerge from a two-year recession, the wrangling over the housing tax has blocked progress on any wider ranging reforms of an economy which has been stuck in virtual stagnation for more than a decade.

headline: Tunisia blames 'terrorist' Ansar al-Sharia for killings
byline: By Tarek Amara
6:20pm EDT

Sharia a terrorist organization after obtaining proof it killed two secular politicians and several soldiers, Prime Minister Ali Larayedh said on Tuesday.

Ansar al-Sharia is the most radical Islamist group to emerge in Tunisia since secular autocrat Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled in 2011. Its attacks have posed a challenge to the authority of the moderate Islamist-led government.

"We have discovered proof that the Ansar group is responsible for the assassinations of Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi and the attacks at Mount Chaambi," Larayedh told reporters.

"We have decided to officially classify this group as a terrorist group. Anyone belonging to it must face judicial consequences," he said.

Ansar leader Saifallah Benahssine, also known as Abu Iyadh, is a former al Qaeda fighter in Afghanistan sought by police for allegedly inciting an attack on the U.S. embassy in Tunis in September 2012.

Four people were killed in those disturbances, which began as a protest over a film that mocked the Prophet Mohammad.

Ansar al-Sharia has been suspected in the two assassinations and violent attacks in the Mount Chaambi area near the Algerian border, including the killing of eight soldiers last month.

Those killings and the assassinations of leftist secular leaders Belaid in February and Brahmi in July plunged Tunisia into political turmoil which political leaders are struggling to resolve. Police said the two politicians were killed with the same gun.

The Tunisian military has carried out air strikes this month on Islamist militants holed up in the Mount Chaambi area, scene of a hunt for jihadi fighters since December.

Secular opposition critics have accused Tunisia's Islamist-led government, which until now had refrained from calling Ansar al-Sharia a terrorist group, of laxity in fighting jihadi militants sowing insecurity in the country.

year war.

Angry members of the majority Sinhalese community protested in the capital, Colombo, on Monday, calling on Pillay to get out of the country and stop criticizing its rights record.

Pillay visited the northern town of Jaffna on Tuesday, which was at the heart of a bid by members ethnic minority Tamil guerrillas to break away and where protesters criticized the United Nations for not protecting them.

"The U.N. failed in its responsibility," said Ananthi Sasitharan, a 42-year mother of three girls, who holds out hope her missing husband is alive, perhaps in a secret detention camp.

The husband, Velayutham Sasitharan, was a top Tamil rebel leader.

Sasitharan was demonstrating with about 300 other people outside the town's main library where the Pillay had a meeting.

They said they had protested after failing in their bid to meet Pillay to discuss their grievances over disappearances and what they see as land-grabs by the military.

The Sri Lanka government battled separatist Tamil guerrillas from 1983 until finally defeating them in 2009.

Tens of thousands of civilians were killed in the final months of the war, a U.N. panel said earlier, as government troops advanced on the rebels' last stronghold.

Many hundreds of people, most of them Tamils like Sasitharan's husband, simply disappeared.

INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE

Sasitharan said her husband had surrendered to the military on May 18, 2009, a day before the government declared victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebel group.

"I am confident that he is alive. He is somewhere in a secret detention center," she told Reuters.

Pillay's seven-day visit comes after a second United States-sponsored U.N. resolution in March this year urged Sri Lanka to carry out credible investigations into killings and disappearances during the war, especially in the brutal final stages.

A U.N. panel said earlier it had "credible allegations" that Sri Lankan troops and rebels both carried out atrocities and war crimes, and singled out the government for most of the responsibility for the deaths.

Sri Lanka has come under international pressure to bring to book those accused of war crimes and boost efforts to reconcile a polarized country. But it has rejected the accusations of rights abuses.

In July, President Mahinda Rajapaksa, under pressure from the United Nations and the West to address the question of rights abuses during the war, ordered an inquiry into mass disappearances.

According to human rights activists in Jaffna, more than 700 people disappeared in the final phase of the war between 2006 and 2009. Some said loved ones had been abducted by unidentified men in white vans.

Sasitharan and other relatives of the missing can only hope.

Sri Lanka's military spokesman, Ruwan Wanigasuriya, said he had no information about Sasitharan's husband.

"There are lists of all the detainees and the released people after the rehabilitation ... There are records of all of them," he said. "Anybody can get them from police."



headline: Catholic cardinal warns of possible violence in Hong Kong over democracy protest
byline: By Greg Torode and James Pomfret
6:20pm EDT

The most prominent Catholic in greater China warned on Tuesday of violence in Hong Kong next year as a planned campaign of civil disobedience demanding full democracy possibly sparks a backlash from the government after unnerving Beijing.

Cardinal Joseph Zen said he would join the Occupy Central campaign targeting Hong Kong's financial district and would happily risk arrest, saying it was a "desperate last resort".

The 81-year-old former Bishop of Hong Kong said he did not think Beijing would live up to its promises of allowing full democracy in the territory by 2017.

The Hong Kong government and pro-Beijing supporters might try to incite violence to justify a crackdown on a peaceful campaign, he added.

"They may like to provoke some violence, yes, and they may even send people to infiltrate the (protesters). So that's a danger," he told Reuters in an interview. "I'm worried we may finish with some violence ... Then they have the pretext to crush everything."

The former British colony returned to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, with the promise of universal suffrage as an "ultimate aim" in its mini-constitution, making it potentially the first place on Chinese soil to enjoy fully democratic elections.

The territory enjoys wide-ranging autonomy from Beijing, with a relatively free press, freedom of religion and independent judicial system, but every year, tens of thousands protest to demand full democracy.

The Occupy Central movement is demanding firm government proposals towards electing the city's leader in 2017 and is planning choreographed acts of peaceful disobedience climaxing with a mass rally to shut down the financial district in July next year.

The threats have alarmed Beijing officials and Hong Kong's leader, Leung Chun-ying, has said there is "no possibility" Occupy could be lawful or peaceful, or that it would be tolerated by the police or the courts.

Zen said, however, that Leung's government needed only to "prepare more prisons for the occasion and not prepare tear gas because those people who join Occupy Central are happy to be arrested. They are there in order to be arrested".

Zen also urged Pope Francis to take a tougher line with Beijing.

China's Catholics are divided between the state-sanctioned Catholic Patriotic Association, which has installed bishops without Vatican approval, and an "underground" wing loyal to the Vatican that rejects state control.

"He should not be too nice," Zen said, noting that Pope Francis had yet to send a message to Beijing or appoint a secretary of state for the Holy See. "They don't understand kindness, they only understand force."

Beijing and the Vatican broke off formal diplomatic relations shortly after the Chinese communists took power in Beijing in 1949.



headline: Afghan Taliban kill 12 'government' workers
byline: By Sharaf Stanekzai
3:59pm EDT

The Afghan Taliban executed 12 Afghan workers in two provinces after accusing them of working for the government, officials said on Tuesday, the latest in a series of brutal attacks on civilians this year.

The Taliban are increasingly targeting civilians seen to be cooperating with the government, raising concerns about the prospects for peace after most foreign troops pull out next year.

President Hamid Karzai condemned the killings with a swipe at Pakistan which he has been visiting for two days.

"The killing of innocent engineers and workers shows that the Taliban and their foreign masters want Afghanistan to be a impoverished and underdeveloped country forever," he said in apparent reference to Islamabad, among others, which he has often accused of playing a double game in the 12-year-old war.

Karzai on Monday stressed the need for Pakistan's help in arranging peace talks with the Taliban in a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

In Herat, one of Afghanistan's most stable provinces whose small but promising private sector is driving the national economy, the Taliban kidnapped and killed four engineers and two workers on Sunday, Governor Fazlullah Wahidi said.

The men, four engineers and two trainers and all Afghan, worked for a World Bank-funded program created by the Karzai government that aims to improve local project management.

"We had gathered some elders to meet the Taliban to tell them that they ... worked for everyone in the country, but the Taliban killed them before they arrived for negotiations," Wahidi said.

The killings came within hours of the discovery of the bodies of six Afghans in the restive eastern province of Paktia. The six, all drivers, were killed by Taliban because they were working with the government, deputy provincial governor Abdul Wali Sehee said.

Elections are expected to be held in Afghanistan in April to replace Karzai, who came to power in 2001 after U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban.

Taliban executions of workers associated with the Karzai administration or the international community are not rare, but recent attacks have typically occurred in the restive eastern and southern parts of the country.

About two weeks ago, eight people who worked for Afghan security forces were executed in violent Ghazni on their way to Kabul by bus.

headline: Australia's Rudd revives plan to move the navy north
byline: By James Grubel
3:59pm EDT

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd revived a plan to move Australia's navy north and out of its eastern base in Sydney Harbour on Tuesday, just three months after a major review of defense strategy ruled out the shift.

Rudd, who is campaigning for re-election on September 7, said he wanted to resurrect the plan to base new missile destroyers and amphibious assault carriers in the northern city of Brisbane. That would allow faster deployment to potential hotspots or humanitarian disasters in the South Pacific.

The move would enable the government to close its Garden Island navy base in the busy Sydney Harbour, which could then be used by cruise ships which jostle for limited space in a popular destination for cruise liners.

"This would include a major strategic decision to deploy the navy's most important ships where they will be best-placed to protect Australia's interests and quickly respond to challenges," Rudd said in an election speech in Sydney.

The idea was recommended by a 2012 review of Australia's defense posture, which said Brisbane would be a better base for the major naval ships because it was closer to the South Pacific.

But a defense White Paper, released on May 3 and drawn up while former leader Julia Gillard was prime minister, ruled out Brisbane. [ID:nL3N0DK00Q] It cited problems with dredging, land acquisition and an estimated A$6 billion ($5.43 billion) cost.

"All suggest that establishing a fleet base in Brisbane would be challenging and require significant continued investment for it to remain sustainable," the white paper said.

COSTLY RELOCATION

Rudd said he would set up a task force to advise within two years on the Brisbane naval base and he would expect the relocation to be completed by 2030. Australia's other main naval base is at Perth on the Indian Ocean.

The two 27,500-tonne assault carriers, known as Landing Helicopter Docks (LHDs), will be the largest ships ever commissioned for the navy, with the first to arrive in 2014. Australia is also buying three air warfare destroyers, to start operations from 2016.

Both are designed in Spain by state-owned Navantia, although they will be partly built in Australia. The destroyers will be capable of supporting a future ballistic missile defense shield.

Lowy Institute military analyst James Brown said he agreed that Australia's strategic interests were increasingly to the country's north, but Rudd's new plan would be too costly at time when the defense budget was already under strain.

"Rudd's plan to fundamentally transform our naval posture would imperil other efforts underway to rebuild the navy," Brown said.

"More importantly, we are already struggling to fund our defense budget to the level both Rudd and his Defense Minister Stephen Smith would like, and we're also struggling to fund even modest infrastructure upgrades called for to enhance U.S. force posture arrangements."

President Barack Obama has announced a stronger focus on the Asia-Pacific region, including the rotation of U.S. marines through northern Australia, in a move which entails more cooperation with Australia's military and facilities.

Rudd, who toppled Gillard in a Labor Party vote to return as prime minister on June 26, is well behind in most opinion polls and is widely expected to lose office to the conservative Liberal-National Party coalition on September 7.



headline: Iraqi Kurdistan rules out intervening over Syrian border
byline: By Sylvia Westall
6:20pm EDT

Iraq's northern Kurdistan region has no plans to send troops into Syria to defend fellow Kurds, a senior Iraqi Kurdish official said, despite safety concerns which have driven thousands to cross the border.

Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani said earlier this month his well-armed region was ready to defend Kurds living in northeastern Syria if they were being threatened by rebel militants who have captured swathes of land in the north.

But his chief of staff said it did not mean that Iraqi Kurdistan was considering sending troops across the border, a move which would drag the region deeper into a conflict that has increasingly split it down ethnic and sectarian lines.

Western powers were weighing up options on Tuesday for a possible military strike against Syria following a suspected chemical weapons attack on a Damascus suburb last week that killed hundreds of civilians.

"Our policy is not to intervene militarily," Fuad Hussein told Reuters in the regional capital of Arbil. "I think the Kurds in Syria, they have got their own people to defend (them)," he said.

"They do not need military units to go there, but perhaps they need all other kinds of support," he said.

He said Iraqi Kurdistan could help coordinate international aid, predicting more refugees after about 40,000 mainly Kurdish Syrians arrived in the last two weeks in one of the largest single movements of people since the conflict began in 2011.

Regional officials refer to northeastern Syria, where most Syrian Kurds live, as "Western Kurdistan." Kurds form big populations in Syria, Turkey and Iran but have no state of their own. They have an autonomous regional government in Iraq.

Officials from the U.N. refugee agency have made internal predictions that up to 100,000 Syrian refugees could to flee to Iraq within the next month if the pace continues.

EMPTY NORTHERN SYRIA

Hussein urged Syrians not to leave unless absolutely necessary, saying he feared the exodus may turn attention away from Kurdish political issues. In Arbil, some Syrians who fled have obtained residency permits and work in hotels and cafes.

"We are worried about having an empty Kurdistan in Syria because if the population will leave then there will not be a Kurdish issue in Syria and then we will also lose that part of Kurdistan," Hussein said.

The influx of refugees last week was so large and sudden that border officials shut a pontoon bridge connecting the countries, fearing it would collapse under the weight of people.

Around 500 dust-covered refugee tents blanket a valley outside of Arbil. The camp grew so fast in the past week that there is a waiting list for tents. Some families have been forced to fashion shelters out of mattresses and blankets.

Refugees said the crisis had made them think about the future of the Kurdish population, which many said they would like to see united in one state.

"I hope that the four pieces of Kurdistan can be one union and people will vote and decide who is going to be in the presidency," said 25-year-old student Fadia Haji, sitting cross-legged at the entrance to her family's tent.

While refugees said they were relieved to come to the stable Iraqi Kurdish region, most dismissed the idea of making it their permanent home.

"We have everything here but if the situation gets better (in Syria), believe me, I will not stay here one hour longer," 31-year-old barber Juwan Khalil Yousef said.



headline: India's ruling party president Sonia Gandhi returns from hospital

6:20pm EDT

Sonia Gandhi, the president of India's ruling Congress party who is widely seen as the country's most powerful politician, was back home from hospital on Tuesday after she took ill during a marathon parliament debate, officials said.

Gandhi, 66, was led limping out of the lower house on Monday evening by her son and colleagues, and then taken by car to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital in New Delhi.

A Congress party official said Gandhi had a touch of viral fever and was fine now. "Madam Gandhi is home now. She is perfectly fine," the official said.

The Italian-born politician, who has led her party to two successive terms governing the world's largest democracy, has played a slightly reduced public role since being treated abroad for an unknown illness in 2011. Still, she is the world's sixth most powerful woman, Forbes magazine said last year.

The party is usually very secretive about Gandhi's health, but several media reports said in 2011 that she had been treated for cancer at New York's Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

On Monday, Gandhi participated in a parliament debate on a scheme to provide cheap food to more than two-thirds of India's poor - one of her pet projects - when she felt unwell.

Gandhi and her son, Rahul, are banking on the nearly $20-billion food security program to boost the Congress party's prospects ahead of a difficult election next year and the party's campaign is built around the two members of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.

FOOD FOR ALL PROGRAMME

Television images showed the normally strong-looking leader trembling as she read out from a clutch of papers a short speech on the food security bill, one of the world's largest welfare programs and one that Gandhi has insisted on to ensure India's poor are not left behind in its emergence as an economic power.

"It's time to take the historic step," she said. "It is my fervent appeal that we shall pass this unanimously."

Critics say the program will strain government finances further at a time when the economy has slowed and the country's external imbalance has deteriorated, with the rupee currency languishing at record lows.

The food security bill was passed two hours after Gandhi and her son left parliament. It must now go to the upper house.

Gandhi became Congress party president some years after the 1991 assassination of her husband, former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.

She declined to become prime minister despite pressure from the party after the first victory in 2004, and chose the quiet economist Manmohan Singh for the top job. However, she arguably wields more power over policy than the prime minister.

Her son is now leading the party's preparations for a national election - due to be held in less than a year.

The Gandhi family, descended from India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, enjoys a status similar to royalty in the country of 1.2 billion. They are not related to independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, a close ally of Nehru.

billion dollar satellite launch industry.

It was the second setback for the Epsilon rocket this month.

An earlier launch was postponed because of a computer glitch. No word was immediately available on the cause of the problem on Tuesday or when the launch might be tried again.

The countdown at Japan's Uchinoura launch centre was broadcast live over the Internet, with commentary in English as well as Japanese. But nothing happened at the end of the countdown.

JAXA, Japan's space agency, later said the launch was halted with 19 seconds to go. Japanese media said an "irregularity" had been detected.

A three-stage rocket, the Epsilon - named for the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet - is 24.4 meters (80 feet) high, about half the size of Japan's workhorse H2A rocket. It weighs 91 tons and has been touted as a new, low-cost alternative.

The rocket was scheduled to carry a telescope into space for observation of the solar system.

Analysts said it was not immediately clear how much of an impact the failure would have on Japan's ambitions to cash in on the international satellite launch industry.

"This was the first flight and it was already postponed once and now will be postponed again," said Yukihiro Kumagai, an analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co securities in Tokyo.

"Inevitably, this will raise some questions, but overall it is unlikely to have much influence," he added, noting that the Epsilon is not scheduled for another flight until 2015.

The rocket's smaller size and a computer system that allows it to perform its own system checks means it can be assembled quickly, which is expected to cut both personnel and equipment costs.

Launch control can be carried out using conventional desktop computers, greatly reducing costs and making the launches more mobile since they could take place at more sites.

U.S. companies had a monopoly on the commercial launch business 30 years ago, but its hold has steadily declined, with most of the business going to the France-based Arianespace, a public-private European partnership that in 2012 reported revenue of 1.3 billion euros.

The market has been shaken up by the recent entry of the California-based Space Exploration Technologies, known as SpaceX.

Russia also markets a variety of rockets for space launches. Its workhorse Soyuz spaceships have been the only vehicles delivering crews to the ISS since the U.S. Space Shuttle fleet was retired from service in 2011.

India and China also provide launch services to some extent.



headline: Iran warns against strike on Syria after gas attack
headline: U.S. lawmakers call on Obama to consult them on Syria
byline: By Patricia Zengerle
3:59pm EDT

U.S. lawmakers urged President Barack Obama on Monday to consult them as he decides how to respond to last week's apparent poison gas attack in the Damascus suburbs, with some complaining that they have not been fully informed.

Secretary of State John Kerry issued a tough statement on Monday, saying that the suspected chemical weapons attack was a "moral obscenity" and accused Syria's government of covering it up.

He added that the Obama administration was consulting with allies and members of Congress and would decide soon how to respond.

But some lawmakers and congressional staff members, particularly Republicans, called for more communication with Congress by the Democratic administration, even as many expressed strong support for "decisive" action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner had "preliminary communication" with the White House about the situation in Syria on Monday afternoon, said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the Republican leader.

"The Speaker made clear that before any action is taken there must be meaningful consultation with members of Congress, as well as clearly defined objectives and a broader strategy to achieve stability," Buck said in a statement.

Republican Representative Howard McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Obama must act "decisively" on Syria and that U.S. credibility is on the line. But he said Congress must be involved in any decision.

"I expect the Commander in Chief would consult with Congress in the days ahead as he considers the options available to him," he said in a statement after Kerry's remarks.

The international talks on how to respond to Syria come as the House and Senate are away from Washington for their five-week August recess. They are not due back until September 9.

The Obama administration could benefit from wide support in Congress, especially as Americans are wary of U.S. involvement in Syria.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Saturday showed that about 60 percent of Americans surveyed said the United States should not intervene in Syria's civil war, while just 9 percent thought Obama should act.

LAYING THE GROUNDWORK

Kerry called some members of Congress on Monday afternoon after his statement. Congressional aides said he was expected to continue the calls into the evening.

White House spokesman Jay Carney was peppered with questions about the administration's plans for talking to lawmakers during his daily briefing for reporters on Monday, which had been delayed in order to take place after Kerry made his statement.

"It is certainly the case that the president has discussed Syria and Assad with members of Congress in the past, and I'm sure he will do so in the future, including on this specific matter. But I'm not going to itemize the calls or consultations except to say that they have been taking place and will continue to take place," Carney said.

Obama has broad legal powers to undertake military action against Syria. Under the 1973 U.S. War Powers Act, the president must notify Congress within 48 hours of launching military action. But forces can fight for 60 days before Congress has to approve any action.

Some Democratic aides have complained that the administration's communications on Syria have been mainly with the Senate and House intelligence committees, leaving many other members in the dark.

Democrats moved to quickly support the White House after Kerry spoke.

Representative Eliot Engel, a Democrat who has backed military aid for Syrian rebels and air strikes against Assad's forces, said he hoped Obama would act quickly.

"Secretary Kerry is right that the use of chemical weapons in Syria is undeniable and shocks the conscience of humanity, and that there must be consequences," he said in a statement.

Republican Representative Scott Rigell, a member of the House Armed Services Committee who represents a district in Virginia with a heavy military presence, said Obama should call Congress back in an emergency session before authorizing the use of military force.

"Congress is not a potted plant in this process," he said in a press release.

Assad's forces in a "moral obscenity."

In the most forceful U.S. reaction yet to last week's gas attack outside Damascus, Kerry said President Barack Obama "believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world's most heinous weapons against the world's most vulnerable people."

Kerry spoke after U.N. chemical weapons experts interviewed and took blood samples from victims of the attack in a rebel-held suburb of Syria's capital, after the inspectors themselves survived sniper fire that hit their convoy.

"What we saw in Syria last week should shock the conscience of the world," Kerry told reporters. "Let me be clear: The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children and innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity."

Kerry's tough language marked an increased effort by the administration not only to point the finger at Assad's government but to prepare the war-weary American public for a potential military response.

He accused the Syrian rulers of acting like they had something to hide by blocking the U.N. inspectors' visit to the scene for days and shelling the area.

"Our sense of basic humanity is offended not only by this cowardly crime, but also by the cynical attempt to cover it up," Kerry said.

Information gathered so far, including videos and accounts from the ground, indicate that the use of chemical weapons in Syria was "undeniable," Kerry said, adding that it was the Syrian government that maintained custody of the weapons and had the rockets capable of delivering them.

A STEP CLOSER TO MILITARY RESPONSE

There were mounting signs that the United States and Western allies were edging closer to a military response over the incident, which took place a year after Obama declared the use of chemical weapons a "red line" that would require strong action.

Obama, who withdrew troops from Iraq and is winding down U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, has been reluctant to intervene in two and a half years of civil war in Syria.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Saturday showed about 60 percent of Americans opposed U.S. military intervention, while only 9 percent thought Obama should act.

However, with his international credibility seen increasingly on the line, Obama could opt for limited measures such as cruise missile strikes to punish Assad and seek to deter further chemical attacks, without dragging Washington deeper into the war.

The United States has started a naval buildup in the region to be ready for Obama's decision, and an administration official said Obama's aides were continuing a series of high-level meetings to determine a course of action.

Kerry stopped short of explicitly blaming the Syrian government for the gas attack but strongly implied that no one else could have been behind it and said the United States had "additional information it would provide in the days ahead.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said there was "very little doubt" that the Syrian government was to blame but that Obama had not yet decided how to respond.

The administration has not set a timeline for responding but officials are preparing options for Obama with a sense of urgency, the State Department said.

Kerry said the administration, which has reached out to foreign allies to coordinate a response, was "actively consulting" members of Congress, though some lawmakers said they had not been fully informed. Republicans in particular have long pressed Obama to act more forcefully against Assad.

A spokesman for John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Boehner had not been consulted before he had "preliminary communication" with the White House about the situation in Syria on Monday afternoon. Boehner told the White House it must present "clearly defined objectives."

A U.S. security source said that as of Monday, Washington and its allies still did not have conclusive scientific evidence that the attack involved chemical weapons, and that such proof could take days or weeks to gather.

But sources said while the evidence may be "circumstantial," U.S. intelligence has "high confidence" that chemical weapons were used by Assad's forces.

"Intelligence agencies are still analyzing data and information related to the attack and are preparing a final assessment for the president," an intelligence official said.

headline: Washington warns Assad over 'undeniable' chemical weapons attack

Assad on notice on Monday that it believes he was responsible for using chemical weapons against civilians last week in what Secretary of State John Kerry called a "moral obscenity."

"President (Barack) Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world's most heinous weapons against the world's most vulnerable people," Kerry said in the most forceful U.S. reaction yet to the August 21 attack.

Speaking after U.N. chemical weapons experts came under sniper fire on their way to investigate the scene of the attack, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the use of chemical weapons was undeniable and "there is very little doubt in our mind that the Syrian regime is culpable."

Kerry said Obama was consulting with allies before he decides on how to respond.

"What we saw in Syria last week should shock the conscience of the world," Kerry told reporters.

"The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children and innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity. By any standard, it is inexcusable. And despite the excuses and equivocations that some have manufactured, it is undeniable."

Military chiefs from the United States and its European and Middle Eastern allies met in Jordan for what could be a council of war, should they decide to punish Assad, who has denied using chemical weapons and blamed rebels for staging such attacks.

Many hundreds of people died in Damascus suburbs in what appears to have been the worst chemical weapons attack since Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein fatally gassed thousands of Kurds in 1988.

U.N. investigators crossed the front line from the center of the capital, which remains under Assad's control, to inspect the Mouadamiya suburb, one of at least four neighborhoods hit by the poison gas before dawn last Wednesday.

The United Nations said one vehicle in its convoy was crippled by gunshots fired by "unidentified snipers." The team continued on after turning back for a replacement car.

Syrian state television blamed rebel "terrorists" for the shooting. The opposition blamed pro-Assad militiamen.

"I am with the team now," a doctor who uses the name Abu Karam told Reuters by telephone from Mouadamiya. "We are in the Rawda mosque and they are meeting with the wounded. Our medics and the inspectors are talking to the patients and taking samples from the victims now."

Wassim al-Ahmad, an opposition activist, said members of the Free Syrian Army umbrella rebel organization and the opposition's Mouadamiya Local Council were accompanying the inspectors on their tour of the suburb.

"The inspectors are now examining victims being treated at a makeshift hospital in Mouadamiya and are taking blood samples from them," Ahmad said.

INTERVIEWING SURVIVORS

Video filmed at the site showed inspectors in black and blue body armor and blue U.N. helmets walking through a street as curious onlookers came up to watch.

They shook hands with men who appeared to be rebels wearing camouflage vests, and were accompanied by doctors and residents. The group descended into the basement of a building where they were told injured survivors were being treated to protect them from more shelling. Another video showed an inspector interviewing a patient and taking notes.

Activists say at least 80 people were killed in Mouadamiya when the district was hit with poison gas. Hundreds of people also were killed in three other rebel-held districts - Irbin, Ain Tarma and Jobar.

An opposition activist said a large crowd of people gathered to air their grievances to the U.N. inspectors, who planned to take samples from corpses.

The inspectors later returned to their hotel and, within an hour, residents reported the shelling of Mouadamiya had resumed.

The decision to proceed with the mission despite coming under attack thwarted an apparent attempt to halt the inspectors' work before it began.

"The first vehicle of the Chemical Weapons Investigation Team was deliberately shot at multiple times by unidentified snipers in the buffer zone area," the United Nations said in a statement. "It has to be stressed again that all sides need to extend their cooperation so that the team can safely carry out their important work."

The inspectors had been stuck in a downtown hotel since the attack, waiting five days for government permission to visit the scene a few miles away. They had arrived three days before the incident, with a mandate to investigate earlier reports of more limited chemical weapons use.

ASSAD TOO LATE

Kerry said Assad's decision to finally allow access was too late to be credible. "That is not the behavior of a government that has nothing to hide," Kerry said, adding that Assad's forces had also destroyed evidence by shelling the area.

"Our sense of basic humanity is offended not only by this cowardly crime, but also by the cynical attempt to cover it up," Kerry said.

He said the U.N. inspectors could at most confirm that chemical weapons were used, not who used them, but that it was Assad's government that has such weapons and the means of delivering them. He said Washington had additional information on the attack that it would make known soon.

Washington and its allies say they worry that the time that has elapsed, and continuous shelling by Assad's forces of the affected areas, could make it impossible for the inspectors to collect evidence. The United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was confident the team could get the data it needs.

Speculation has been mounting that Western countries will order some kind of military response to an incident that took place a year after Obama declared the use of chemical weapons a "red line" that would require strong action.

With his international credibility seen increasingly on the line, Obama could opt for limited measures such as cruise missile strikes to punish Assad and seek to deter further chemical attacks, without dragging Washington deeper into the war. The United States has started a naval buildup in the region to be ready for Obama's decision.

In neighboring Israel, citizens have been queuing up for gas masks in case Assad responds to a Western attack by firing on Israel, as Iraq's Saddam did in 1991.

PHONE CONSULTATIONS

With tensions rising over Syria, British Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a holiday to lead a top-level security meeting. Obama, Cameron and French President Francois Hollande all spoke to each other and other allies in the past few days in a flurry of phone calls. Cameron also called Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday.

Several NATO countries have issued statements pledging a response, although none has been specific about what is planned.

Top military officers of the United States, Britain, France, other NATO allies and the main anti-Assad countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and Turkey, met in Jordan on Monday to discuss Syria, diplomats there said.

The conference was planned but took on new significance because of the latest events, the diplomats said.

The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempsey, a co-host of the meeting with his Jordanian counterpart, has been one of the voices in Washington urging caution and emphasizing the costs of a full-scale military intervention in a war in the heart of the Middle East.

Obama, who withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq and is winding down the conflict in Afghanistan, is reluctant to involve the United States in another war. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Saturday showed about 60 percent of Americans opposed U.S. military intervention, while only 9 percent thought Obama should act.

ASSAD DEFIANT

Assad denies the accusations that his forces used chemical weapons and said the United States would be defeated if it intervened in his country.

"Would any state use chemicals or any other weapons of mass destruction in a place where its own forces are concentrated? That would go against elementary logic," he told the Russian newspaper Izvestia. "Failure awaits the United States as in all previous wars it has unleashed, starting with Vietnam and up to the present day."

Russia, Assad's main arms supplier and diplomatic defender in the U.N. Security Council, says rebels may have been behind the chemical attack. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said any intervention in Syria without a Security Council resolution would be a grave violation of international law.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius noted that Russia and China would probably veto a U.N. Security Council vote to allow strikes against Syria. But British Foreign Secretary William Hague said it would still be possible to respond to a chemical weapons attack without the Security Council's permission.

There are precedents. In 1999 NATO attacked Serbia, a Russian ally, without a Security Council resolution, arguing that action was needed to protect civilians in Kosovo.

Turkey, a NATO ally and major backer of Syria's opposition, said it would join any international coalition even if a decision for action could not be reached at the United Nations.



headline: Obama talks Syria with Australia's Rudd; Rice meets Israelis
byline: By Mark Felsenthal
6:20pm EDT

President Barack Obama spoke with Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on Monday about possible international responses to the Syrian crisis while his national security adviser discussed Syria and security with Israeli officials, the White House said.

In a call with Rudd, "the two leaders expressed their grave concern about the reported use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against civilians near Damascus on Wednesday," the White House said in a statement. They "discussed possible responses by the international community," it said.

National security adviser Susan Rice hosted a delegation led by Yaakov Amidror, the chairman of Israel's National Security Council. The meetings were part of a series of regular high-level bilateral consultations and touched on Iran, Egypt, Syria, and other regional security issues, the White House said.

In their strongest condemnation of Syria to date, Obama administration officials said on Monday it was undeniable chemical weapons had been used and that there was little doubt the Syrian government was responsible for an attack that claimed the lives of hundreds of men, women and children.

"The president and his team are evaluating options with regards to responses to this specific violation of an international norm - the prohibited use of chemical weapons against civilian populations," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.

Carney said a military response is among the options under consideration.

As Obama mulls the possibilities, U.S. officials have made clear they want to win international support before taking any actions, and the administration has begun a series of consultations with allies. The president spoke over the weekend with British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande.

Australia's Rudd, a former diplomat whose country is a close U.S. ally and takes the rotating U.N. Security Council chair from Sunday, said the international principles behind the events in Syria were clear.

"I do not believe the world can simply turn a blind eye to the use of chemical weapons against a civilian population resulting in nearly 300 deaths, or more, and some 3,600 people hospitalized," he said in a speech in Sydney on Tuesday.

Taking no action, he said, would send a message of impunity to "every autocracy in the world contemplating the future use of chemical weapons".

headline: Argentina offers bond swap to skirt U.S. court rulings
byline: By Alejandro Lifschitz and Brad Haynes
6:20pm EDT

Argentina's government is proposing a voluntary bond swap on its foreign debt, shifting payments to Buenos Aires, if it cannot overturn U.S. court rulings that threaten to trigger its second debt crisis in just over a decade.

The bond swap would allow Argentina to keep paying the creditors who agreed to restructure the country's sovereign debt after a record $100 billion default in 2002, President Cristina Fernandez said in a televised address on Monday night.

Investors in international markets would have the option to swap their foreign debt for Argentine bonds if ongoing appeals of the U.S. court rulings are rejected, a government source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Argentina on Friday lost its appeal of a U.S. court order requiring it to pay $1.33 billion to "holdout" hedge funds that refused steep discounts following the 2002 default.

If Argentina refuses to pay off the holdouts in full, the ruling could block payment overseas to the 93 percent of bondholders who accepted restructurings in 2005 and 2010 that give them less than 30 cents on the dollar.

In a direct plea to the U.S. Supreme Court, Fernandez urged justices to overturn the decision, which she warned could undermine future sovereign debt restructurings.

She also proposed a third restructuring of Argentina's defaulted debt, offering holdouts another opportunity at the terms offered in the 2010 bond swap.

Her more conciliatory tone contrasted sharply with her past denunciations of the so-called "vulture funds" she accuses of trying to bankrupt the country. That defiant attitude had drawn the ire of judges in the United States, who fault Argentina for a lack of good faith negotiation with creditors.

Still, Fernandez insisted that her government was meeting its obligations and rejected one appeals court judge's description of Argentina as a "uniquely recalcitrant debtor."

"I would say that rather than 'recalcitrant debtors' we are serial payers," she said. "Just as the country entered the Guinness (World Records) for the biggest sovereign debt default, we should also be in the Guinness among the countries that have most fulfilled our obligations over the past 10 years."

In the 2005 and 2010 restructurings, Argentina issued international debt under New York, British and Japanese law.

But Fernandez's proposal of a new bond swap raised questions about whether investors would be interested in taking Argentine bonds in lieu of foreign debt, given strict currency and capital controls that the left-leaning Fernandez government has imposed.

"Changing the location of the payments to Buenos Aires is going to be extremely complicated amid the currency controls," said Jorge Todesca, a former deputy economy minister who is now head of the Finsoport economic consultancy.

"Argentina will never be able to issue public debt abroad if it continues trying to dodge a settlement," he said. "We can assume Argentina will continue to be financially isolated from the rest of the world as long as this goes on."

The president said she would send a bill to Argentina's Congress on Tuesday in order to offer remaining holdouts the same terms as the restructured debts.

"I expect some holdouts to take this opportunity and tender their defaulted debt," said Alberto Bernal, head of emerging markets at Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami. "The hardcore litigants will remain out of the swap."

Bernal called the proposal to swap foreign debt for bonds paying in Buenos Aires a "pragmatic" move, adding that it would be easier than getting the necessary number of bondholders to agree on changing covenants of existing bonds.



headline: New Mexico's largest county to allow gay marriage after court ruling
byline: By Zelie Pollon
6:20pm EDT

sex marriages are now legal in New Mexico's most populous county and the city of Albuquerque, a court ruled on Monday, adding to recent victories for gays and lesbians seeking the right to wed statewide.

Last week, a judge in Santa Fe County ordered the county clerk there to issue same-sex marriage licenses and a clerk in the southern part of the state decided to hand out such licenses independently of any court ruling.

The ruling could set precedent for expanding the right of gays and lesbians to eventually marry statewide in New Mexico, said representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union.

Denying gays and lesbians the right to marry violates the state constitution, which prohibits gender-based discrimination, wrote Bernalillo County Judge Alan Malott in a decision on Monday clearing the way for same-sex marriage in that county.

"Gay and lesbian citizens of New Mexico have endured a long history of discrimination," Malott ruled. "Denial of the right to marry continues this unfortunate, intolerable pattern and establishes irreparable injury on plaintiffs' part."

The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Center for Lesbian Rights on behalf of same-sex couples seeking the right to marry. It is one of several cases filed recently in New Mexico on the question of gay marriage.

The case included plaintiffs from Santa Fe County and the judge also ruled that gay marriage licenses should be issued there. But a ruling last week by a different judge had already cleared the way for same-sex marriage in Santa Fe County.

Under Malott's ruling, Bernalillo County, with 673,000 residents, will also be required to immediately issue same-sex marriage licenses.

That will mean that three counties in New Mexico will hand out the licenses, including Do単a Ana County in southern New Mexico where the county clerk last week said he would start doing so.

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage.

"Our state is now on the brink of joining the growing list of states who live and honor the values of family, liberty and love," Peter Simonson, ACLU of New Mexico executive director, said in a statement.

The group was not sure how the ruling would affect the state's other 30 counties which are not issuing same-sex marriage licenses, said Micah McCoy, spokesman for the ACLU of New Mexico.

"It's a pretty unconventional route for this kind of case to take, but it will be very useful in arguing the case in other counties where people want to get married," McCoy said.

The New Mexico Supreme Court has declined to rule on lawsuits seeking the right for gays and lesbians to marry, but asked lower courts to handle them first.

Republican lawmakers in the state said they were contemplating ways to fight the decisions by the district court judges in Bernalillo and Santa Fe counties as well as the Dona Ana County Clerk's move to issue same-sex marriage licenses.

"It is inexplicable how a district court just today discovered a new definition of marriage in our laws, when our marriage law has not been changed in over a century," State Senator Bill Sharer, a Republican, said in a statement.



headline: U.S. points finger at Assad over Syria gas attack

Assad's forces in a "moral obscenity."

In the most forceful U.S. reaction yet to last week's gas attack outside Damascus, Kerry said President Barack Obama "believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world's most heinous weapons against the world's most vulnerable people."

Kerry spoke after U.N. chemical weapons experts interviewed and took blood samples from victims of the attack in a rebel-held suburb of Syria's capital, after the inspectors themselves survived sniper fire that hit their convoy.

"What we saw in Syria last week should shock the conscience of the world," Kerry told reporters. "Let me be clear: The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children and innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity."

Kerry's tough language marked an increased effort by the administration not only to point the finger at Assad's government but to prepare the war-weary American public for a potential military response.

He accused the Syrian rulers of acting like they had something to hide by blocking the U.N. inspectors' visit to the scene for days and shelling the area.

"Our sense of basic humanity is offended not only by this cowardly crime, but also by the cynical attempt to cover it up," Kerry said.

Information gathered so far, including videos and accounts from the ground, indicate that the use of chemical weapons in Syria was "undeniable," Kerry said, adding that it was the Syrian government that maintained custody of the weapons and had the rockets capable of delivering them.

A STEP CLOSER TO MILITARY RESPONSE

There were mounting signs that the United States and Western allies were edging closer to a military response over the incident, which took place a year after Obama declared the use of chemical weapons a "red line" that would require strong action.

Obama, who withdrew troops from Iraq and is winding down U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, has been reluctant to intervene in two and a half years of civil war in Syria.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Saturday showed about 60 percent of Americans opposed U.S. military intervention, while only 9 percent thought Obama should act.

However, with his international credibility seen increasingly on the line, Obama could opt for limited measures such as cruise missile strikes to punish Assad and seek to deter further chemical attacks, without dragging Washington deeper into the war.

The United States has started a naval buildup in the region to be ready for Obama's decision, and an administration official said Obama's aides were continuing a series of high-level meetings to determine a course of action.

Kerry stopped short of explicitly blaming the Syrian government for the gas attack but strongly implied that no one else could have been behind it and said the United States had "additional information it would provide in the days ahead.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said there was "very little doubt" that the Syrian government was to blame but that Obama had not yet decided how to respond.

The administration has not set a timeline for responding but officials are preparing options for Obama with a sense of urgency, the State Department said.

Kerry said the administration, which has reached out to foreign allies to coordinate a response, was "actively consulting" members of Congress, though some lawmakers said they had not been fully informed. Republicans in particular have long pressed Obama to act more forcefully against Assad.

A spokesman for John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Boehner had not been consulted before he had "preliminary communication" with the White House about the situation in Syria on Monday afternoon. Boehner told the White House it must present "clearly defined objectives."

A U.S. security source said that as of Monday, Washington and its allies still did not have conclusive scientific evidence that the attack involved chemical weapons, and that such proof could take days or weeks to gather.

But sources said while the evidence may be "circumstantial," U.S. intelligence has "high confidence" that chemical weapons were used by Assad's forces.

"Intelligence agencies are still analyzing data and information related to the attack and are preparing a final assessment for the president," an intelligence official said.

headline: Palestinians killed in Israeli raid, peace talks continue

6:20pm EDT

Israeli troops shot dead three Palestinians during an early morning raid in a West Bank refugee camp on Monday, hours before negotiators met for another round of peace talks, Palestinian sources said.

Israeli border police said they entered the Qalandiya camp, near Jerusalem, to arrest a man and were confronted by a crowd throwing firebombs and rocks.

Witnesses said the Israeli forces opened fire and hospital officials told Reuters three men were killed.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, said one of its employees, a 34-year-old father of four, was among the dead.

"Credible reports say that (Robeen Zayed) was on his way to work and was not engaged in any violent activity. He was shot in the chest," said UNRWA spokesman Christopher Gunness.

A military spokeswoman confirmed that troops had been shot at and returned fire in self-defense. She added that the forces arrested the man they had come to detain.

"Large, violent crowds which significantly outnumber security forces leave no other choice but to resort to live fire for self defense," Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner, another military spokesman, said.

The riot had become "so large and violent that it was vital for forces to assist in containing it," he added.

An Israeli security source said an investigation had showed live fire was only directed towards rioters.

PEACE TALKS CONTINUE

The U.S.-brokered peace talks carried on after the clashes, though no details emerged of the discussions.

Talks resumed last month after a three-year stalemate caused by Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas Israel captured in 1967 which Palestinians seek for a state along with the Gaza Strip.

Neither party has expressed much optimism for a major breakthrough and the negotiators have met largely in secret, alternating between Israeli and Palestinian locations.

Thousands of residents of the tightly-packed camp, later carried the three men's bodies, draped in Palestinian flags with their heads wrapped in traditional black and white chequered scarves, in a funeral procession that wound its way through its narrow alleyways.

Around ten masked Palestinian militants fired their automatic weapons into the air in salute.

After the funeral, dozens of local youths threw stones towards Israeli soldiers at the Qalandiya checkpoint, a main crossing between the West Bank and Jerusalem, and they were met with volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets.

Nabil Abu Rdaineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described the killings as "assassinations".

"The series of Israel crimes and new settlement tenders constitute a clear message on the real Israeli intentions towards the peace process, and there will be negative consequences to these actions," he said in a statement.

The Israeli police arrested a local man who had previously served a nine-year prison sentence for alleged militant activity, residents said. About a dozen protesters were wounded in the clash, they added.

Israeli troops often enter Palestinian-controlled territory to detain people suspected of planning attacks, usually conducting the raids during darkness to minimize confrontation.

Violence in the West Bank has worsened since the beginning of 2013.

With Monday's deaths, Israeli forces have killed 14 Palestinians there this year, most of them in clashes, compared with three fatalities in the same period in 2012, according to United Nations figures.

right party that is threatening to bring down the prime minister's coalition and has rattled markets.

The measures included cutting funding for official cars by a fifth, reducing consultancies now valued at 1.2 billion euros per year, and a decree that will gradually convert about 150,000 temporary state administration contracts into permanent ones.

The move followed a meeting between Prime Minister Erico Letta and the secretary of Berlusconi's People of Freedom party (PDL), Angelino Alfano, to seek agreement on a housing tax issue, which has dogged the government for months.

The disagreement, and a looming vote on whether to expel the media mogul from parliament after a tax fraud conviction, have made relations between Letta's center-left Democratic Party (PD) and the PDL increasingly tense.

The spat between the unwilling coalition partners has reignited fears of new political instability in the euro zone's third-largest economy as it struggles to emerge from a two-year recession, sending shares and bonds lower.

The PDL says the tax, known as IMU, must be scrapped despite fears this could blow a hole in Italy's fragile public finances

Alfano said after the meeting that negotiations were ongoing, but an agreement was possible. Letta has set a deadline of a government meeting on Wednesday for an accord.

"There's still work to be done before Wednesday, but we can do it," Alfano said in a tweet. Letta did not comment.

But even if a compromise is reached on the housing tax, the question of Berlusconi's future remains potentially explosive.

A top PD official on Monday accused the PDL of "blackmail" after several of its members threatened to bring down the government if the PD voted to expel Berlusconi from the Senate in a ballot due by October.

"The PD rejects any blackmail or ultimatum from the PDL," PD Secretary Guglielmo Epifani told the daily newspaper La Repubblica on Monday, reaffirming that his party would vote in favor of Berlusconi's removal from parliament.

"Berlusconi needs to take note of what led to his conviction, and he has to explain why he would bring down the government at a time of crisis."

DEEP DIVISIONS

Epifani warned that if the government collapsed just as Italy was showing the first signs of recovery after its longest postwar recession, there would be "enormous costs" for society and renewed tremors in financial markets.

Italy's main stock market index, fell 2.1 percent, with shares in Berlusconi's Mediaset dropping 6.25 percent after hitting its lowest level since July 10. The main index of broader investor sentiment, the spread between Italian 10-year bond yields and their safer German equivalents widened to 249 basis points.

"It doesn't look like the politicians will find a compromise to get out of this crisis, which puts all measures that need to be taken to spur the economy on ice," said a Milan trader.

Letta, appointed to lead the cross-party coalition after inconclusive elections in February, is trying to push on with measures to spur growth and fight record levels of unemployment, but has struggled to pass any meaningful reforms in the face of deep divisions in the government.

Berlusconi's own party is riven by tensions between members pushing for compromise with the PD and those who want to pull the plug on Letta.

On Monday, Berlusconi ordered supporters not to make any further public statements that could damage party unity.

The billionaire has been holed up in his luxury villa near Milan since early August when Italy's supreme court handed him a four-year jail sentence, commuted to one year, for a massive tax fraud at his Mediaset empire.

He is desperately trying to find a way to stay in the political game despite the sentence, which he is expected to start serving, either under house arrest or doing social work, in mid-October.

The supreme court decision is not Berlusconi's only legal headache. He is also appealing in a lower court against a seven-year jail sentence imposed in June for abuse of office and paying for sex with a minor.



headline: Cuban state begins to move out of the restaurant business
byline: By Marc Frank
6:20pm EDT

run cooperatives as Raul Castro's communist government continues its retreat from running just about everything on the Caribbean island.

The restaurants will become cooperatives in October, with hundreds more likely to follow if the experiment succeeds.

All aspects of the business from buying the food to splitting the profits will be decided by the employees, not from on high in the government. A similar process is already under way in other sectors from construction and transportation to farmers' markets and light manufacturing.

The restaurants are the first to be ceded by the state since communist authorities took over all eateries in 1968.

Until 5 years ago, visitors venturing from their hotels had basically one option: state-run eateries, often with a reputation for poor quality.

Today, there are close to 2,000 private restaurants as local entrepreneurs take advantage of market-oriented reforms initiated by President Raul Castro, who took over for his ailing older brother Fidel in 2008.

"The government is hoping that cooperative owners, with pride in their establishments and motivated by profits, will offer much better service and higher quality goods to customers, both to tourists and fellow Cubans," said Richard Feinberg, a nonresident senior fellow of the Washington-based Brookings Institution and author of a number of studies on Cuba's economic reforms.

Some of the restaurants slated to become coops are off the beaten track and cater to a mainly Cuban clientele using the local peso currency.

Others - for example La Casona de 17 and La Divina Pastora, both in Havana - operate in a dollar equivalent, called the convertible peso or CUC, and serve mainly tourists.

The Divina Pastora, nestled under Moro Castle at the narrow entrance to the Bay of Havana, sits on some of the city's most valuable real estate, owned by the military-run Gaviota tourism corporation.

La Casona de 17 is part of the tourism ministry's entertainment and restaurant chain, Palmares, which operates upscale establishments across the island.

"We are a pilot project, but in the future I think all Palmares restaurants will become cooperatives," said Marylin Herrera, 25, as she waited on tables at La Casona de 17, located in the busy Vedado district in the city center.

Herrera said it would be quite a challenge for the 50-odd workers to run the restaurant, which they will lease from the state, but looked forward to having "much more flexibility in how we operate and what we offer."

A DIFFICULT BUSINESS CLIMATE

Castro, speaking at a Communist Party congress in 2011 where a sweeping plan to revamp the Soviet-style economy was approved, outlined efforts to create a "non-state" sector of private and cooperative businesses.

"The growth of the non-public sector of the economy ... will allow the state to focus on raising the efficiency of the basic means of production ... while relieving itself from those management activities that are not strategic for the country," he said.

Castro has already taken steps to deregulate small private businesses in the retail service sector. Thousands of smaller state shops and taxis have been leased to individual employees, and fallow state lands have been leased to would-be small farmers in search of improved production and efficiency.

"We are in an experimental phase with a group of cooperatives in certain sectors of the economy. This allows us to follow each project, learning as we go along before they become generalized," Grisell Trista Albasu, a member of the Communist Party commission charged with implementing the reform plan for state businesses, told official media last week.

The cooperatives function independently of state entities and businesses, set prices according to the market in most cases, and receive better tax treatment than individually owned businesses, according to a decree published in December.

The law allows for an unlimited number of members and use of contracted employees on a three-month basis.

While it is difficult to find any local experts who oppose the state getting out of secondary economic activity such as the restaurant business, it is relatively easy to find critics of the process.

In the case of cooperatives, which are supposedly being formed on a voluntary basis, the vast majority to date have been the result of decisions made at the highest level of government and imposed on the employees, who must accept their fate or be laid off.

"This was not a spontaneous process ... at least in the vast majority of cases," a Cuban economist said, requesting anonymity due to restrictions on talking with foreign journalists.

The cooperatives "face a difficult business environment where a decrepit infrastructure, obsolete equipment and banking practices, high taxes and restrictions on trade will make success difficult," he said.



headline: Congo army battles M23 rebels near eastern city of Goma
byline: By Kenny Katombe
6:20pm EDT

A U.N. brigade tasked with neutralizing armed groups in Congo has assisted the country's army in clashes with eastern rebels on Monday, ending a brief lull in days of fighting that has killed and wounded dozens.

The violence, the most serious in months, is the first major test for the newly deployed U.N. Intervention Brigade which has an unprecedented mandate to launch military operations against M23, one of the rebels at the heart of nearly two decades of conflict.

A senior officer with the brigade told Reuters that U.N. peacekeepers were "assisting" the Congolese army in operations against M23 rebels late on Monday.

"We are supporting the army in their operations but have not ourselves engaged the rebels at this stage," the officer said by telephone from Goma, requesting not to be identified.

The brigade has fought alongside Congo's army several times since the latest fighting erupted on Wednesday.

The M23 rebels said they were targeted by air strikes and came under heavy weapons fire on Monday afternoon.

"As usual, we expect that ground troops will come in the wake of these bombings," M23 said in a statement. Congo's army said rebels had attacked first and it was retaliating.

Congolese army spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli said clashes were taking place at Kibati, about 11 km (7 miles) north of Goma, a city of a million people on the Rwandan border.

The rebels briefly seized Goma in November before withdrawing and committing to Ugandan-hosted peace talks. Negotiations have faltered and renewed fighting has exacerbated tensions between Rwanda and Congo.

Several shells fell in Rwanda during clashes around Goma last week, prompting Kigali to accuse Kinshasa of bombing it. Congo denied the charge and accused Rwandan troops of backing the rebels.

The cross-border accusations underscore the rebellion's roots in a complex web of local politics and regional conflicts over ethnicity, land and minerals. Rwandan troops fought in two Congo wars but Kigali says it is not supporting the M23.

'VERY CHAOTIC'

A doctor at a military hospital near Goma said he was treating those wounded in "ferocious" fighting on Saturday.

"It is very chaotic and difficult to have precise numbers, but we have had around 15 deaths so far. There have also been 150 injuries," the doctor said, asking not to be named.

The doctor and a U.N. official said the rebels, whose positions were struck by U.N. attack helicopters on Saturday, had lost many men in the fighting.

A rebel spokesman denied those reports. "How can we continue to protect our territory while suffering the kinds of losses they are saying? It is nonsense," said spokesman Colonel Vianney Kazarama.

The United Nations said three of its soldiers - two Tanzanians and a South African - were injured on Saturday when a shell landed near their position just north of Goma.

Sonia Gandhi, the president of India's ruling Congress party who is widely seen as the country's most powerful politician, was taken to hospital on Monday after feeling unwell during a marathon parliament debate on a major new food welfare scheme.

Gandhi was led limping out of the lower house in the early evening by her son and colleagues, then taken by car to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) hospital in New Delhi.

"Sonia has been admitted to AIIMS, her condition is stable," party spokesman Bhakta Charan Das told Reuters. He did not give more details.

It was not immediately clear what caused the turn six hours into the debate. Some media reports said she had complained of chest pain, others that she was suffering from a viral fever. A spokesman at the hospital could not be reached for comment.

The Italian-born politician, who has led the party to two successive terms governing the world's largest democracy, has played a slightly less public role in politics since being treated abroad for an unknown illness in 2011. The party is usually very secretive about her health.

Gandhi, 66, became Congress chief some years after the assassination in 1991 of her husband, the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

She declined to become prime minister despite pressure from the party after the first victory in 2004, and chose instead the quiet economist Manmohan Singh for the top job.

However, she arguably wields more power over government policy than Singh from her post as Congress president, with party members and cabinet ministers grateful to her for reviving their fortunes with two uninterrupted terms in office.

Earlier on Monday, television images showed the normally strong-looking leader trembling as she read out from a clutch of papers a short speech on the bill, which is a flagship scheme for the government and a pet project of Gandhi.

"I am standing in support of food bill. It's time to take the historic step," she said. "It is my fervent appeal that we shall pass this unanimously."

Gandhi had made it the government's top legislative priority before the next election to pass the bill that gives subsidized grain to almost two-thirds of India's 1.2 billion population. It was passed two hours after she and her son Rahul Gandhi left parliament and must now go to the upper house.

Rahul Gandhi is the scion of the family, one of the world's most successful modern political dynasties that stretches back to the nation's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

The young Gandhi is leading the party's preparations for a national election - due to be held in less than a year.



headline: Israelis line up for gas masks over Syria war fears
byline: By Allyn Fisher-Ilan
6:20pm EDT

Thousands of Israelis are lining up for gas masks or ordering them by phone, spurred on by fears that any Western military response to last week's alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria could ensnare their own country in war.

Western powers are considering military action to punish the Syrian government for the alleged attack that killed hundreds near Damascus last week.

With speculation mounting that NATO powers might fire cruise missiles into Syria, many in Israel worry that President Bashar al-Assad, embroiled in a 2-1/2 year uprising against his rule, could strike out at the Jewish state in retaliation.

Israeli media reports of Syrian officials threatening retaliation against Israel for any Western strike have only served to heighten the anxiety.

"We live in a crazy region. All it takes is for one crazy person to push a button and you never know, everything can go up in flames," said Victor Bracha, 72, one of those queuing for protective gear at a makeshift distribution center in a shopping mall in Jerusalem.

Maya Avishai, spokeswoman for the Israeli Postal Service which oversees the distribution of gas masks on behalf of the military's homefront command, said four times as many people as usual had phoned in orders in the past two days.

"Twice as many as usual are showing up at public centers to pick them up. The pressure has been great," Avishai said. There was also talk of expanding the number of centers handing out gas masks to meet demand, she added.

DOUBTS

Israel has eschewed any involvement in the internal conflicts gripping its Arab neighbors in the past two years, and some Israelis doubt Assad would turn his guns on Israel.

"It is not in his interest, it could bring about his demise more quickly," Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Sunday.

"It would be insane for somebody to try and provoke Israel," he added in remarks to foreign correspondents in Jerusalem on Monday.

Shlomi Goldstein, 32, another shopper at the mall in Jerusalem, said he had no plans to join those queuing for masks, confident that Israel could deter any attack.

"I think Assad wouldn't dare to attack us, he knows that if he did it could be the last thing he ever does," he said.

Israel has provided its citizens with gear to cope with possible chemical or biological attacks since the 1991 Gulf War, when U.S.-led troops drove Iraq out of Kuwait.

During that conflict, Iraq fired Scud missiles into Israel and its leader, Saddam Hussein, threatened a chemical attack on Israel, though he never acted on this.

Three years ago Israel launched a campaign to renew the protection kits. But until last week's attack in Syria, only around 5 million of Israel's 8-million strong population had updated theirs, officials said.

Israel remains technically at war with Syria, which has long demanded an Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights, land that Israel captured in a 1967 war.

Congo's army said it clashed with eastern rebels on Monday, ending a brief lull in days of fighting that has killed and wounded dozens.

The violence, the most serious in months, is the first major test for a newly-deployed U.N. Intervention Brigade which has an unprecedented mandate to launch military operations against rebels at the heart of nearly two decades of conflict.

It has fought alongside Congo's army several times since the latest fighting erupted on Wednesday, but said it did not take part in Monday's clashes.

The M23 rebels said they were targeted by air strikes and came under heavy weapons fire on Monday afternoon.

"As usual, we expect that ground troops will come in the wake of these bombings," M23 said in a statement. Congo's army said rebels had attacked first and it was retaliating.

Congolese army spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli said clashes were taking place at Kibati, about 11 km (7 miles) north of Goma, a city of a million people on the Rwandan border.

The rebels briefly seized Goma in November before withdrawing and committing to Ugandan-hosted peace talks. Negotiations have faltered and the renewed fighting has exacerbated tensions between Rwanda and Congo.

Several shells fell in Rwanda during fresh clashes around Goma last week, prompting Kigali to accuse Kinshasa of bombing it. Kinshasa denied the charge and accused Rwandan troops of backing the rebels.

election.

Under the plan, the government will sell subsidized wheat and rice to 67 percent of its population of 1.2 billion. India is home to a quarter of the world's hungry poor, according to United Nations data, despite being one of the biggest food producers and experiencing years of rapid economic growth.

The vote broke a long stalemate in parliament, potentially clearing the way for several reforms aimed at spurring the flagging economy which the government hopes to pass in an extended session that ends on September 6

Faced with an unruly parliament, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition government last month resorted to an executive order to implement the program, which his Congress party hopes will help win it a third consecutive term in power. The next election is due by May.

The Rajya Sabha upper house must now approve the decree before it becomes law.

'NATIONAL SHAME'

In a foretaste of the battle for votes to come, the main opposition party says the welfare scheme, which expands an existing cheap food program covering 218 million people, is still too narrow to tackle widespread malnutrition among India's millions of poor.

Lawmakers passed the bill only after nearly nine hours of debate and the inclusion of amendments that government sources could lead to an additional requirement of about 3 million tonnes of grain.

Singh said last year that the child malnutrition in India, where almost 50 percent of children are underweight, was a "national shame". Despite that, some critics have dubbed the new plan a waste of public money at a time when growth has been steadily slowing.

The main opposition Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which already runs a successful food handout program in Chhattisgarh state, voted for the bill. It had earlier criticized it for making food more expensive and failing to provide enough nutrition.

The BJP's likely candidate for prime minister, Narendra Modi, said in a letter to Singh on August 7 that the scheme would effectively reduce allowances for very poor families and make them spend more on food, because entitlements would be calculated per individual rather than per family.

He said families below the poverty line would now have to spend an extra 85 rupees ($1.3) per month to keep eating the same amount of rice and wheat.

The expanded subsidy is a pet project of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, who led the party to victory in the last two elections on the back of populist programs such as a rural jobs plan and a $12.5 billion farmer loan waiver passed just before the 2009 general election.

In a dramatic development, Gandhi, widely seen as the country's most powerful politician, had to be led out of parliament during the debate. She was admitted to a New Delhi hospital after complaining of chest pain, television channels said.



headline: Backers of Madagascar's deposed leader to name new candidate
byline: By Alain Ilioniania
6:20pm EDT

Backers of the deposed president of Madagascar said on Monday they would name a new candidate to run in a delayed presidential election after his wife was barred from the race.

Supporters of former President Marc Ravalomanana earlier this month threatened to take to the streets after Madagascar's Special Electoral Court (CES) blocked his wife, Lalao Ravalomanana, as well as President Andry Rajaoelina, from running.

Monday's announcement could help defuse tensions on the Indian Ocean island that has been blighted by political turmoil since Rajaoelina toppled Ravalomanana in 2009 with the help of the military after opposition protests.

But it was not immediately clear if a new candidate would be accepted as the deadline for submitting names has past.

Rajaoelina and Ravalomanana had reached a deal with regional states to restore order on the island, based on the condition neither would run. But Rajaoelina changed tack when Ravalomanana's wife declared, saying her bid broke the spirit of the pact.

"We wish to present our candidate to replace Mrs Lalao Ravalomanana to the CES," Mamy Rakotoarivelo, the president of the National Assembly, said, speaking after the court refused to rescind its decision to bar the former leader's wife.

He did not name the new candidate but added that "we will soon know his identity".

The election is now scheduled for October, the third time the date has been put back. It was originally planned for May.

The court's ruling to bar the candidates was welcomed by regional and Western powers who say the former French colony needs a fresh start after years of chaos that have scared off investors and tourists, deepening poverty in the poor nation.

headline: French government nears deal with unions on pension reform
byline: By Julien Ponthus and Nicholas Vinocur
6:20pm EDT

France's government neared a deal with trade unions on Monday to overhaul the pension system through a slight lengthening of people's working lives that should rein in a spiraling deficit, union chiefs said.

Under market pressure to reform its indebted retirement system, the Socialist government has ruled out raising the legal retirement age of 62 and hopes sticking to softer measures will avoid setting off prolonged street protests.

Moderate CFDT union leader Laurent Berger - whose approval is crucial for the reform to be passed - called the first of two days of talks "positive". He said Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault's proposal to lengthen the pay-in period was acceptable.

The government's main scenario is to make workers pay pension contributions for a period of up to 44 years starting in 2020, government sources say. As things stand, a pay-in period of 41.5 years is to be made mandatory for all by 2020, whereas today people retire after around 40.5 years in work.

"It's a good start," Berger told journalists after the talks, the last round of discussion with unions and employers before the draft reform goes to the cabinet next month.

"There will be no reduction in pensions, no change in how pensions are calculated before 2020 and no massive acceleration in lengthening the period for paying contributions."

The reform - the boldest of President Francois Hollande's 15 months in office - is to be presented at a cabinet meeting on September 18 and then debated in parliament in early October.

Despite close scrutiny from foreign investors and the European Commission, Hollande and Ayrault - both struggling with approval ratings of around 30 percent - have opted for a cautious reform. Hollande has only a slim majority in parliament and is wary of alienating his party's left wing.

LIMITED AMBITION

While his approach has avoided strife, it falls short of European Commission calls for a rise in the legal retirement age, which is below Germany's 65, for example - even if people in many European states tend to retire closer to 62 in reality.

Despite support from moderate unions for switching to a Swedish-style points-based system, where workers have more say in deciding when they retire, Hollande's aides say such a change would be too dramatic during an economic crisis.

Some key details still need to be nailed down as hardline unions oppose workers having to pay longer for their pensions. They plan a day of protest and work stoppages on September 10.

Hardline CGT union chief Thierry Lepaon said the talks were encouraging, but not enough to justify calling off protests.

One contentious point is whether the government will raise the "CSG" social payroll contribution that firms and employees pay to help plug a pension shortfall set to peak in 2020, which would inflate labor costs already seen as burdensome.

With the Socialists already fending off public anger over planned tax rises in the upcoming 2014 budget, Ayrault has said that no decision on the CSG would be taken until after the talks with unions and employers' group Medef.

Pierre Gattaz, head of the Medef employers' union, hinted that in exchange for a rise in the CSG, the government may offer firms a cut to the amount they pay toward family allowances.

"I reminded the prime minister that we were in an extremely grave situation, with a pension system burdened by a 15-billion-euro deficit," Gattaz told journalists.

Unions are divided. While the reformist CFDT says it favors a deep overhaul of the system, the more hardline FO and CGT warn they will fight any attempt to lengthen the pay-in period.

"I will tell Jean-Marc Ayrault: don't touch the pay-in period, because that will cross our red line," FO union leader Jean-Claude Mailly told Le Parisien daily. "People in companies are getting angry, and the situation is volcanic."

year gameplan for overhauling areas such as public spending and education in keeping with its strategy of pursuing gentle, incremental reforms.

Responding to criticism that he has been slow to embark on structural changes and lacks a big-picture vision, President Francois Hollande wants ideas on his desk by year-end for sprucing up industry and slimming down the welfare state.

"The point of this is to leave behind the silo mentality we're in today and think more broadly," said Jean Pisani-Ferry, a prominent economist and scholar whom Hollande has appointed chief of a new economic policy planning body.

Building on a May labor reform and a pension bill headed to parliament in October, the aim is to link structural reforms in areas like education, housing and workplace training rather than looking at French problems in a piecemeal way, he said.

It will look in particular at France's competitiveness lag and assess the impact of a tax credit scheme for companies introduced late last year that Pisani-Ferry said had failed to reduce labor costs as much as the government had hoped.

"The European landscape is evolving very fast in terms of relative competitiveness," Pisani-Ferry said in a meeting with a small group of reporters. "France's problems have not been resolved by the measures taken so far."

He said the panel would bring in people from civil society as it looks at which industrial sectors should be invested in to match changes in global consumption as rich-world growth subsides and the developing-world middle class balloons.

Plagued with some of the lowest approval ratings of any modern French president, Hollande is under pressure to pull Europe's No. 2 economy out of stagnation but is restricted by a hostility to change in France that saw even his conservative predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, mostly shy away from bold reforms.

Surrounded on one side by liberal economic advisers and on the other by old-school leftists, Hollande has opted for a "softly-softly" style of nudging through changes with consensus from unions and employers that contrasts with Sarkozy's more forceful approach.

This tactic enabled Hollande to push through modest but meaningful changes to the labor code in May, whereas Sarkozy's one big reform to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62 in spite of union opposition sparked mass protests and strikes.

SMALL STEPS

Some economists worry that a fledgling economic recovery could take the pressure off Hollande to slash bloated public spending and thus ease some of the tax burden on companies.

The 10-year plan may also seek to take some of the focus off Hollande's short-term woes. He wants to deliver on a promise to reverse the jobless trend by year-end and faces a fight over tax rises and a reform to make people work longer for pensions.

The first stage of the exercise, getting government ministers to outline their ambitions for France in 2025, drew smirks from opposition politicians at their rose-tinted visions of full unemployment and burgeoning industry.

"It's a rather hackneyed communications ruse to make us think they are working," sniffed conservative lawmaker Eric Ciotti. "They basically prefer to talk about 2025 than their current disagreements."

In contrast, Pisani-Ferry's starting-point report states that France in 10 years will be "older, smaller and poorer."

France has shed 2 million industrial jobs over three decades as its manufacturing prowess has waned. Jobless claims hit an all-time record in June, even as Hollande repeated his pledge to cut the 10.8 percent unemployment rate by the end of the year.

A labor reform passed in May was aimed at encouraging hiring. But many companies say they feel too strangled by taxes and the uncertain economic climate to take on new staff.

"The big question is whether this strategy of reforming by small steps can work or not," a government adviser told Reuters.

"With this, at least, we want to get across the message that we are working for tomorrow at the same time as working for today," he said of the 10-year-plan.

While the Socialist Party's left wing is opposed to further loosening labor laws or slimming down the welfare model, surveys show public opinion has shifted in favor of reforms and signs of forward-planning may go down well with voters.

Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault was in talks with unions on Monday to hammer out final terms of a pension reform aimed at reining in a ballooning deficit in the system.

Pisani-Ferry said Hollande would use the plan, which would contain detailed numerical objectives, as a basis for future reforms, especially in education where he noted emerging nations are leaping ahead in forming tomorrow's software engineers.



headline: Syria chemical evidence fades as U.N. team under fire

scale chemical weapons attack they are seeking is already fading from the scene.

The longer it takes the 20-member team to get to the spot where rockets carrying nerve agents are said to have killed hundreds of people on August 21, the harder it will be for the mission led by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom to find meaningful remnants of toxic munitions.

With Western powers considering military strikes against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad if they conclude he used gas-laden rockets in an escalation of the country's two-and-half-year civil war, reliable evidence will be key to their deliberations.

Traces of chemicals on munitions fragments, buildings and impact craters will already have degraded. It will also have become difficult to detect anything in the urine of inhabitants in the outskirts of Damascus. Perpetrators will have had days to try to cover up proof of the attack, experts said.

Ralf Trapp, a disarmament expert who worked for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is supplying experts to the U.N. team, said traces of chemicals in a victim's urine fade within days, though blood could contain traces for weeks.

"They should be collected as soon after the incident as possible, preferably within a couple of weeks after the alleged use," Trapp said.

Some feared that the U.N. team would arrive too late to gather any meaningful samples.

Former U.N. advisor George A. Lopez Of the University of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, accused Assad's regime of applying "calculated maneuvers" on the ground in Damascus to counter U.N. and world reaction.

"Assad forces continued conventional shelling of the area, while locals and others cleared away bodies," he said.

"This hastened breakdown and contamination of chemical compounds needed to provide undeniable proof of the type of gas, its concentration level, and its source to the inspectors, who may still be one or more days away from taking soil and other samples."

In a conflict that is dividing world powers, inspectors will also have to safeguard the integrity of the samples.

They have to make sure containers and vials transported to the laboratories for analysis follow a strict chain of custody, with fiber-optic seals and accompanied by exhaustive documentation "to be able to demonstrate that the samples have not been tempered with", Trapp said.

Samples should be sent to two or preferably three designated laboratories from among those in the 20 countries with which the OPCW has working agreements.

Jean Pascal Zanders, an independent expert who runs chemical weapons blog www.the-trench.org, said other sources of evidence, such as witness interviews, could also be used to support claims of a large-scale chemical attack.

"We're looking at such a large number of people reported to have been affected by the chemical attacks. People would have a narrative, and those narratives when compared with each other would be able to build up a picture of what has happened," he said.

Autopsies are another option, he said, but under Muslim tradition, the dead are buried within 24 hours, and families would have to grant permission for the remains of their relatives to be exhumed.

As Monday's shooting showed, there is more to the mission than science alone.

Per Runn, a Swedish chemical weapons expert who worked with Sellstrom and is a former branch head at the OPCW, said one of the major hurdles will be access to areas under rebel control, where the Syrian government cannot provide security guarantees.

"I do not envy Ake's position. As the person on the ground for the U.N., he is the one who will have to make the decision whether it is safe or not to go," Runn told Reuters.

"He will face criticism no matter what he does. If something goes wrong, he will be criticized for taking risks. If he refuses to go, he will be criticized for being too cautious. He's caught between more than a rock and a hard place," he said.

headline: Merkel allies stage 11th-hour revival behind young leader

6:20pm EDT

Philipp Roesler, the young leader of Germany's Free Democrats (FDP), looked like a dead man walking at the start of the year, until he took a major risk that turned his and his party's fortunes around.

His party, which shares power with Angela Merkel's conservatives, was in freefall, and rivals were planning a putsch, fearful the FDP would be booted out of government in a September election with Roesler at the helm.

Then, the man many in Berlin had dismissed as a political lightweight, caught the plotters on the hop by offering to resign, a day after the FDP had confounded pollsters by doing well in a regional vote. They backed down and pledged their loyalty instead.

The FDP and Roesler have been on the mend ever since. Recent opinion polls put support for the FDP at 6 or 7 percent, up from just 2 percent a year ago, and above the 5 percent threshold needed to win seats in parliament.

That is still a far cry from the record 14.6 percent the party received in 2009. But it is thanks to the recent revival that Merkel can hope to continue her center-right coalition after next month's vote, instead of being forced into an awkward partnership with her left-wing rivals.

"Roesler took a gamble and won. That has boosted his approval ratings," said Peter Matuschek of pollster Forsa.

Founded in 1948, the FDP has been in government with either the left or right for 46 years of the Bundestag's 63-year history. Party luminaries include Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who served as foreign minister for nearly 20 years, helping bring about German reunification under then chancellor Helmut Kohl.

Four years ago its record score helped Merkel cruise to a second term. Then the troubles began.

The business-friendly party alienated supporters by breaking its campaign promise of tax cuts. And its leader at the time, foreign minister Guido Westerwelle, was lambasted for siding with Russia and China and refusing to back a U.N. resolution on military action in Libya.

Between 2010 and 2012, the FDP was plagued by infighting and found itself ejected from six of Germany's 16 regional governments. According to some opinion polls, its nationwide support sank as low as 1 percent.

"A year ago, half a year ago, I didn't believe we would make it back into parliament, let alone the government," said Dieter Thiele, a retired physicist and grass roots FDP member who attended a rally last week in the eastern German city of Halle. "Now the mood has turned completely, and people are looking at us differently."

VIETNAM ORPHANAGE

One reason for the turnaround is Roesler, who was parachuted into the party chairmanship at the tender age of 38, when Westerwelle's popularity was at rock bottom. He also became economy minister and vice-chancellor to Merkel.

He is one of Germany's most unlikely politicians.

Born in South Vietnam in 1973, as the Americans were winding down their involvement in the war there, he spent the first months of his life in an orphanage run by Roman Catholic nuns, before being adopted by a German couple.

His adoptive father had heard about all the abandoned children in Vietnam while training as an army helicopter pilot in the United States and was moved to adopt a baby himself.

When he and his wife split a few years later, he raised his son alone, placing him before the mirror one day to explain why he looked different from other children.

Roesler says he is German and feels German. He has not tried to trace his origins in Vietnam, though it is something he is often asked about, including by President Barack Obama on a trip to the United States.

"If I were to look, it would create the impression I am lacking something. I have never lacked anything," he said in a 2012 interview. "Germany is my home, Vietnam a part of my life I don't remember." He doesn't even know his real birth date.

Roesler praises Germany for the opportunities it offers those of foreign background, though he has encountered prejudice.

Earlier this year, when the FDP was still languishing in the polls, one of his party colleagues openly questioned whether German society was ready to accept someone who looked Asian in a position of power. In some areas of Germany, notably in the former East, he has been the target of racism, referred to as a "Jap" or "Chinaman", according to party colleagues.

In the lows of 2012, even some major media outlets appeared to resort to stereotype, painting him as a polite, earnest guy who wasn't ready for the rough and tumble of Berlin politics.

SHOWDOWN

That narrative began to change last year when Roesler openly challenged Merkel over her choice for the ceremonial post of German president and won.

Then came the showdown at FDP headquarters in Berlin on January 21, a day after the FDP defied expectations and won a robust 9.9 percent of the vote in the key state of Lower Saxony.

At that meeting, Roesler shocked the party leadership by offering to step down in favor of Rainer Bruederle, a 68-year-old FDP veteran and the favored choice of FDP rebels to lead the party into the election.

A flustered Bruederle declined, and a deal was struck; Roesler would stay on as party leader, while Bruederle would be the face of the FDP's election campaign.

Katja Raab, a local FDP politician in Halle, said the duo at the top of the party allowed it to broaden its appeal before the vote: "We have Roesler's considered, academic approach, and we have the swaggering speeches from Bruederle."

Germans brand the FDP a party of the affluent, of dentists and tax advisers. Its election manifesto promises no tax rises and an end to the unpopular solidarity tax for troubled regions in eastern Germany.

"Only with us", reads its slogan, playing on the fears some Germans have about voting out a center-right government that has steered a steady course through the euro crisis.

"The mood is great. Better than at any point in the last four years, I'd say," Roesler told foreign correspondents in Berlin earlier this month. "People are listening to us, they want to know our opinions, and the whole party is very optimistic."



headline: Russia warns against military intervention in Syria
byline: By Alexei Anishchuk
6:20pm EDT

Russia warned Western powers on Monday against any military intervention in Syria, saying the use of force without a U.N. mandate would violate international law.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had no plans to be drawn into a military conflict over the civil war in Syria and that Washington and its allies would be repeating "past mistakes" if they intervened in Syria.

"The use of force without the approval of the United Nations Security Council is a very grave violation of international law," Lavrov told a news conference at which he discussed accusations by rebel forces that Syrian government forces have used chemical weapons.

Russia is Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's key ally and one of its main arms suppliers. It is also a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council, where it has protected Damascus from three consecutive resolutions that were intended to put pressure on him to end violence.

For more than two years, Moscow has demanded that any change of government in Syria must be carried out via a political process in which Assad must be part, and that no talks on Damascus' future can be predicated on Assad's exit from power.

Lavrov said last Wednesday's alleged chemical attack, which U.N. chemical weapons experts began investigating on Monday, was probably the work of rebels who wanted to derail plans by Washington and Moscow to hold talks on Syria's future.

Russian and U.S. officials are expected to meet on Wednesday to look at preparations for the conference.

Expressing concern about statements suggesting NATO had the right to intervene after the chemical attack without securing the approval of the United Nations, Lavrov said the unapproved use of force would "sharply aggravate" the situation.

He urged the West not to go down the "dangerous path" it had taken several times before and added: "We have no plans to go to war with anyone."

"If anybody thinks that bombing and destroying the Syrian military infrastructure, and leaving the battlefield for the opponents of the regime to win, would end everything - that is an illusion," Lavrov said.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has said Russia and China would probably veto a Security Council vote to allow strikes against Syria. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, however, said it would still be possible to respond to a chemical weapon attack without the Security Council's backing.

Zagreb could face legal action for failing to apply EU extradition law, the European Commission said on Monday, weeks after Croatia became the bloc's newest member.

The small Adriatic state became the 28th member of the European Union on July 1, marking a recovery from years of war after Yugoslavia collapsed in the 1990s.

Days before entry, Zagreb changed its laws to prevent authorities from extraditing suspects of crimes committed before 2002, when EU rules were changed, potentially protecting veterans from Croatia's 1991-95 independence war from facing inquires elsewhere in the EU.

The Commission has accused Zagreb of contravening EU rules and said its top officials would meet next to discuss whether punitive action should be taken.

"The fact that Croatia's national legislation has been changed a few days before accession to contradict EU law is really not a minor issue for us," a spokeswoman for EU justice chief Viviane Reding told a news briefing.

"This infringement of EU law goes to the very heart of European judicial cooperation."

Reding has said measures could include some cuts in financial aid to Zagreb - Croatia is due to receive billions of euros in the next seven years in funds meant to bring living standards closer to EU average.

The Commission may also introduce a monitoring mechanism to check Croatia's efforts in complying with EU rules. Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in 2007, face similar EU scrutiny over their progress in fighting corruption, and governments there view such measures as embarrassing and unnecessary.

EU governments could also use the dispute over the European Arrest Warrant as an excuse to delay discussions over bringing Croatia into Europe's passport-free Schengen travel zone, which Zagreb said was its next priority.

Croatia's opposition HDZ party, which ruled the country in the 1990s and between 2004-2011, has accused Zagreb's leftist-led government of tweaking EU rules to protect former Croatian intelligence chief Josip Perkovic.

The official had worked for communist Yugoslavia's secret service, the UDBA, and led intelligence services after Croatia became independent, and now faces charges in Germany over the 1983 murder of a Yugoslav dissident in Bavaria.

Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic has denied any connection with the German case and says Croatia only sought to exercise the same privileges as its EU peers.

EU members could request exemptions from the European Arrest Warrant before 2002, but the Commission says that only applies to states that were in the bloc at the time.

Croatia could have asked for exemptions when it was negotiating its entry to the European Union, but did not do so.



headline: South African construction, airport workers widen wave of strikes
byline: By Jon Herskovitz
6:20pm EDT

South African construction and airport workers went on strike for higher wages on Monday, extending a series of industrial action threatening to slow growth in Africa's largest economy.

The labor unrest poses a risk for President Jacob Zuma's African National Congress as it heads into elections next year facing increasing criticism that it has not done enough to help the millions of unemployed and working poor almost 20 years after the end of white-minority apartheid rule.

The rand last week tumbled to a four-year low after gold miners last week threatened to strike and 30,000 workers in the car manufacturing sector, responsible for 6 percent of gross domestic product, walked off the job.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said about 90,000 of its members in the construction sector planned to down tools on Monday. More than 50 percent of employers were affected by the labor action, industry group SAFCEC said in a statement.

Employment in the construction industry was at just over 1 million people at the end of June, according to government data.

The strike has grazed construction shares, with an index of top companies in the sector down about 0.7 percent since news broke last week of the walk-out, compared with a 1.2 percent rise in the broad All-Share index.

Firms affected by the strikes include Wilson Bayly Holmes Ovcon, Aveng Ltd and Group Five Ltd.

Police reported clashes at a building project in Johannesburg's financial district of Sandton, where NUM members in the union's red T-shirts arrived at the site and forced workers to down tools.

"I am going to support the strike because I need more money," said Luvo Joti who stopped work after NUM arrived.

The government called for speedy and peaceful resolutions to the various labor disputes.

More than 60 people have been killed in mining sector labor strife since last year, including 34 striking workers shot dead by police a year ago at Lonmin's Marikana platinum mine.

THREAT TO ECONOMY

The NUM is demanding up to a 40 percent increase in pay and benefits for some workers while employers are offering a 7.5 percent rise, according to the industry group called the South African Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors (SAFCEC).

South Africa's central bank has said that inflation is projected to run at 5.9 percent in 2013 and wage settlements well above inflation could further threaten the fragile economy.

Some members of the SATAWU transport union also went on strike on Monday, staging a small picket at Johannesburg's main international airport in pursuit of a 12 percent wage increase.

The firm that runs all the country's major airports, Airports Company South Africa, said the strike had not affected any flights and it had contingency plans in place to ensure smooth operations.

Autoworkers with the NUMSA union met on Monday to consider a revised offer from employers of a 10 percent raise. NUMSA wants 14 percent and expects to reach a decision on Wednesday on whether to accept the new offer.

The car strike that started a week ago is costing the economy an estimated $60 million a day and hitting global producers including Toyota, Ford and BMW.

In the gold sector, NUM gave gold mining companies seven days on Saturday to meet its demand for pay increases of up to 60 percent or face strikes.

Major firms vulnerable to walkouts included AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields and Harmony.

NUM, the main mining union, walked out of deadlocked wage talks with the companies last Wednesday, setting the scene for a gold industry shutdown that could cost over $35 million a day in lost output, based on current spot prices of the metal.

headline: Italy PM meets with centre right to defuse growing row
byline: By Catherine Hornby

right party on Monday to try to defuse a row which is threatening to bring down his fragile ruling coalition and has rattled financial markets.

Relations between Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) party and Letta's center-left Democratic Party (PD) are increasingly tense ahead of a vote on whether to expel the media mogul from parliament over his tax fraud conviction, and because of a disagreement over a property tax.

The spat between the unwilling coalition partners has reignited fears of fresh political instability in the euro zone's third-largest economy as it struggles to emerge from a two-year recession, sending shares and bonds lower.

A top PD official on Monday accused the PDL of "blackmail" after several of its members threatened to bring down the government if the PD voted to expel Berlusconi from the Senate in a ballot due by October.

"The PD rejects any blackmail or ultimatum from the PDL," PD Secretary Guglielmo Epifani told the daily newspaper La Repubblica on Monday, reaffirming that his party would vote in favor of Berlusconi's removal from parliament.

"Berlusconi needs to take note of what led to his conviction, and he has to explain why he would bring down the government at a time of crisis."

He warned that if the government collapsed just as Italy was showing the first signs of recovery after its longest postwar recession, there would be "enormous costs" for society and renewed tremors in financial markets.

Italy's main stock market index, fell 2 percent, with shares in Berlusconi's Mediaset hitting a six-week low. The main index of broader investor sentiment, the spread between Italian 10-year bond yields and their safer German equivalents widened to 250 basis points.

"It doesn't look like the politicians will find a compromise to get out of this crisis, which puts all measures that need to be taken to spur the economy on ice," said a Milan trader.

"There is the risk that this could hit our economic recovery at a time when the country has shown some signs of a pick-up," he said.

HOUSING TAX

The parties are also divided over economic reforms and tax issues, notably a widely hated housing tax which the PDL says must be scrapped despite fears this could blow a hole in Italy's fragile public finances.

Letta, appointed to lead the cross-party coalition after inconclusive elections in February, is trying to push on with measures to spur growth and fight record levels of unemployment but has struggled to pass any meaningful reforms in the face of deep divisions in the government.

On Monday, he met PDL secretary Angelino Alfano, along with Economy Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni and Regional Affairs Minister Graziano Delrio, to try to seek agreement on the housing tax issue, which has dogged the government for months.

Berlusconi's own party is struggling to contain internal tensions between members pushing for compromise with the PD and those who want to pull the plug on Letta.

On Monday, Berlusconi ordered supporters not to make any further public statements that could damage party unity.

The billionaire has been holed up in his luxury villa near Milan since early August when Italy's supreme court handed him a four-year jail sentence, commuted to one year, for a massive tax fraud at his Mediaset empire.

He is desperately trying to find a way to stay in the political game despite the sentence, which he is expected to start serving either under house arrest or doing social work, in mid-October.

The supreme court decision is not Berlusconi's only legal headache. He is also appealing in a lower court against a seven-year jail sentence imposed in June for abuse of office and paying for sex with a minor.

The cabinet is due to meet later on Monday to agree on measures to cut public administration spending.



headline: Karzai stresses need for Pakistani help in Taliban peace process
byline: By Katharine Houreld
6:20pm EDT

Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Monday stressed the need for Pakistan's help in arranging peace talks with the Taliban in a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who assured him of his support.

Pakistan backed the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s and is seen as a crucial gatekeeper in attempts by the U.S. and Afghan governments to contact insurgent leaders who fled to Pakistan after the group's 2001 ouster.

But Afghanistan has long accused Pakistan of playing a double game in the 12-year-old war, saying its neighbor, facing a Taliban insurgency of its own, makes pronouncements about peace, but allows elements of its military to play a spoiling role.

Pakistan is keen to limit the influence of its old rival, India, in Afghanistan.

Karzai, who has close ties with India, said he had "primarily and with emphasis" asked the Pakistanis to help with reconciliation as most foreign troops prepare to leave Afghanistan by the end of next year.

He wants Pakistan to help arrange contacts between the Taliban and the Afghan High Peace Council, the government body tasked with reconciliation, or release high-ranking Taliban prisoners who might act as interlocutors.

Sharif, who appeared with Karzai to deliver statements after their talks in the Pakistani capital, did not specifically address those requests.

It is unclear whether the Afghan Taliban, in power from 1996 and 2001, will have a role in the next government.

The Taliban, fighting to expel foreign forces and impose Islamist rule, have refused to talk to Karzai, accusing him of being an American puppet.

"For the two countries, the primary concern is lack of security for their citizens and the continued menace of terrorism," said Karzai. "It is this area that needs to have primary and focused attention from both governments."

"STRONG, SINCERE SUPPORT"

Sharif assured him of support and closed his address by listing economic deals the two countries had struck.

"Pakistan (has) strong and sincere support for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. We fully agreed that this process has to be inclusive, Afghan-owned and Afghan-led," Sharif said.

The Taliban in June set up an office in Doha, touted as a conduit for peace talks with the United States, but the office infuriated Karzai the day it opened by displaying a flag bearing symbols from the time the Taliban ruled Afghanistan.

Karzai accused the Taliban of running an embassy rather than an office. The office has now closed.

Karzai has made 19 trips to Pakistan but this was his first meeting with Sharif since Sharif's landslide election win in May.

An Afghan-based analyst said people there might be disappointed that Karzai and Sharif had not show more solidarity on the question of the Taliban insurgency.

"The two leaders were not on the same page," said Barhan Osman of the Afghanistan Analysts Network think-tank.

"One was talking about the peace process as the top issue and one was talking about trade as the top issue ... it was not what the Afghans were looking for."

Even if Sharif wanted to persuade the Taliban to talk to Karzai, it was unclear how much influence he had, Osman said.

Security and foreign policy in Pakistan is overseen by the military. Ever since Muslim Pakistan was carved out of British-ruled India in 1947, the military has seen India as Pakistan's greatest threat.



headline: Syrian Kurds trek to Iraq over parched hills
byline: By Sylvia Westall and Murad Jambaz
6:20pm EDT

scorched hills.

She is one of more than 40,000 Syrians who have escaped to Iraq's autonomous northern Kurdish region in the past 10 days. The exodus is one of the biggest cross-border migrations since what is now a civil war between the forces of President Bashar al-Assad and the rebels started more than two years ago.

The mainly Kurdish refugees are fleeing groups of fighters that have been seizing control of villages over the border, Khalil said at a reception camp in the Iraqi frontier village of Suhilla, around 400km (250 miles) northwest of Baghdad.

"We don't know them. They just come, take power and give themselves a name," she said, as her 18-month-old son slept spread-eagled on a cloth in front of her. "We don't know who we are supposed to support. The people, we are just left to be trampled underfoot," the 28-year-old Kurd said.

The sudden influx of Syrian refugees has brought Iraq's prosperous and well-armed northern region closer to the conflict which has already killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions. The leader of the autonomous region has promised to protect Kurds over the border from attacks.

Some Kurds in Syria have taken up arms and clashed with rival rebel groups in a revolt which has deepened sectarian and ethnic lines. Kurds form large populations in Syria, Turkey and Iran but have autonomous rule only in Iraq.

The mass flight into northern Iraq started just over a week ago when Iraqi Kurdish authorities opened a rickety pontoon bridge over the Tigris River. Officials said they were forced to act because there were reports that their kinsmen were being slaughtered by al Qaeda-linked fighters over the border, in a part of Syria the Iraqi regional government refers to as Western Kurdistan.

BRIDGE SHUT

Days after the first wave of refugees, border chiefs shut the temporary bridge, saying they feared it would collapse under the weight of people. Now they are allowing only people needing emergency aid to travel over in small metal boats.

"I don't think we can open it again, it is not safe, it is not stable," said Nazm Hamid Abdullah, a deputy border chief at a post near the bridge, which now stops short of the shore.

The rest of those escaping have to cross by foot on a winding 4.5 km (3 mile) hill path. A mule can be hired from villagers on the Syrian side to carry luggage for about $10.

Khalil's journey began 350 km (220 miles) to the west in the Syrian rebel-held city of Raqqa which she fled by car to avoid the fighting. Then the trouble in the border area forced her to take the path to Iraq, which avoids the river crossing.

The Islamist militias al Nusra and al Qaeda's Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant have been fighting for control of parts of northern and northeastern Syria in recent months against Kurdish groups which have taken advantage of the anti-Assad rebellion to assert their control over majority-Kurdish areas.

At the border camp, refugee Dijla Mohammed Ibrahim said Kurds have been horrified by an alleged chemical weapons attack in the Syrian capital last week. "They did it in Damascus, maybe they will use them in Raqqa," the 22-year-old said. "Innocent children and women were killed. Those people who use such chemical weapons should be punished."

The Damascus attack has revived memories of when thousands of Iraqi Kurds were gassed in Halabja by the warplanes of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 1988.

For Fatma Mohammed Nasser, looting by members of the rebel army had been the trigger to leave Syria. "They stole all of our things, our house, our possessions," she said, feeding her five-month-old son with water from a baby bottle. "My brother is newly-married and their house was seized." Rebels even made off with the wedding dress.

"Everyone was so sad, even children started to hate life," Nasser said. "The Free Army stopped giving us baby milk and surrounded us instead."

She sat under a plastic canopy assembled by aid groups who handed out water and food. Aid workers said some Kurdish troops had quietly crossed into a "no man's land" between the countries to stack crates of drinks and snacks on the path through the hills where temperatures can reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 F).

At the camp, children with cracked lips slept on top of suitcases and plastic bags stuffed with clothes. Women wrapped their faces with scarves to protect from the dusty wind and shielded children's eyes.

"There have been two years of attacks, there is no life, no work anymore," said Mohammed Bin Mustafa, 57, sitting in the shade with his sandals neatly tucked to one side. "I ask Allah to send someone good to us in Syria, to lead us back to the life we had before."



headline: Ex-Maoist fighters join army in Nepal but challenges remain
byline: By Gopal Sharma
6:20pm EDT

Nepal commissioned a group of former Maoist rebel fighters as officers in the national army on Monday, fulfilling a main component of a fragile peace deal that ended civil war but has failed to bring political stability to the Himalayan nation.

Some 70 Maoist fighters who battled the army in the decade-long conflict that ended in 2006 joined their former foes in a parade at the Nepalese Military Academy at Kharipati, 20 km (12 miles) east of Kathmandu.

The army had initially resisted integrating the Maoist guerrillas, saying they were politically indoctrinated.

In total, 1,460 of the 19,600 fighters registered by the United Nations after the war have joined the army. The rest left camps for civilian life, some with a rehabilitation package of up to $10,200.

Former fighter Anil Rokaya said he was happy to join the army and had put the past behind him.

"There is no question of bad feelings. That was a different time when we fought and the context has changed after the peace process," said the 26-year-old.

Dressed in dark green military uniforms, the last fighters received the insignia of their new positions in the army from Khilraj Regmi, chairman of the caretaker cabinet that is governing Nepal before elections due in November

"This is a matter of happiness for all that the integration process has completed successfully," Regmi said.

But Nepal is some way from normality. Seven years after the end of the war, it is still without a new constitution, and successive governments have collapsed because of differences about the course the young republic should take.

MONARCHY ABOLISHED

The Maoists emerged as the biggest party in an election in 2008 for a special Constituent Assembly, which subsequently abolished the 239-year-old Hindu monarchy and turned Nepal into a secular republic.

Bharat Pulami Magar, who battled the army for five years, said the fall of the monarchy was a result of the conflict.

"This would not have been possible otherwise," the 33-year-old Magar said, a cream colored Buddhist prayer scarf and marigold garland dangling from his chest.

Nepal has scheduled November elections for a second Constituent Assembly to draft the charter after a similar body was dissolved last year without completing it.

About 16,000 people were killed in the war.

Analysts say Nepal will not enjoy lasting peace without a constitution that addresses demands for decentralization of power to ethnic regions. The economy is in tatters and survivors of the violence that killed thousands are demanding justice and compensation.

"These have not received any attention from the state so far and must now be addressed for sustained peace," said Bishnu Raj Upreti, who teaches conflict management at Kathmandu University.

Macedonia's government and opposition on Monday resolved a row over responsibility for a parliamentary brawl that had threatened to trigger a snap election and further damage the country's attempt to start European Union membership talks.

Setting aside their differences, both sides signed up to a report drafted by an ad hoc commission tasked with investigating the incident in December when opposition legislators were ejected from parliament for brawling.

Though largely inconclusive, the report nevertheless appears to apportion most of the blame to the government. Conservative Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski threatened on Saturday to force an election two years ahead of schedule rather than sign up to the findings, but backed down on Sunday.

"We decided that, in the interests of the state, and even if it costs us, we will vote and sign the commission's report the way the opposition wants," Gruevski said late on Sunday.

Government and opposition representatives on the committee inked the report on Monday.

"I'm happy that the interest of the citizens was put above the parties," said commission president Borce Davidkovski, who was nominated to the post by the opposition. "The hard work is finished and I would like to thank the European Union expert who gave everything for this report to be final."

The commission was formed under EU pressure, after the row triggered an opposition boycott of parliament and threatened to undermine a local election. It was aided in its work by an EU official.

The EU at the time warned the impasse was further undermining the former Yugoslav republic's chances of starting talks on joining the bloc. The accession bid is already hostage to a two-decade dispute with neighboring EU member Greece over Macedonia's name, which it shares with a northern Greek province.

Macedonia was made an official candidate for membership in 2005, just four years after pulling back from the brink of civil war during clashes between government security forces and an ethnic Albanian guerrilla army.



headline: As Bo trial ends in China, prosecutor demands severe punishment
byline: By John Ruwitch
6:20pm EDT

Chinese prosecutors demanded a heavy sentence for ousted top politician Bo Xilai as his divisive, dramatic trial ended on Monday, saying his "whimsical" challenge to charges of bribery, graft and abuse of power flew in the face of the evidence.

Bo was a rising star in China's leadership circles when his career was stopped short last year by a murder scandal in which his wife, Gu Kailai, was convicted of poisoning a British businessman, Neil Heywood, who had been a family friend.

Bo, who was Communist Party chief of the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, has mounted an unexpectedly feisty defense since the trial began on Thursday, denouncing testimony against him by his wife as the ravings of a mad woman.

The court, announcing the end of the five-day trial, said the verdict would come at a later date. It did not provide details, but it could be announced within the next few weeks.

Bo has repeatedly said he is not guilty of any of the charges, although he has admitted to making some bad decisions and to shaming his country by his handling of former Chongqing police chief, Wang Lijun, who first told Bo that Gu had probably murdered Heywood.

Wang fled to the U.S. consulate in the nearby city of Chengdu in February last year after confronting Bo with evidence that Gu was involved in the murder. Wang was also jailed last year for covering up the crime.

Summing up the evidence, the state's prosecutor said Bo should not be shown leniency as he had recanted admissions of guilt provided ahead of the trial.

"Over the past few days of the trial, the accused Bo Xilai has not only flatly denied a vast amount of conclusive evidence and facts of his crimes, he has also repudiated his pre-trial written testimony and materials," the court cited the prosecutor as saying.

"We take this opportunity to remind Bo Xilai: the facts of the crimes are objective, and can't be shifted around on your whim," it said, without saying which of the four prosecutors had made the remarks.

In his final address to the court, Bo admitted to personal failings.

"I know I'm an imperfect man," Bo said. "I'm very subjective and bad-tempered. I have committed serious errors and mistakes ... I did not manage my family and subordinates well, I have made big mistakes and am sorry to the party and the people."

SALACIOUS ALLEGATIONS

Bo could theoretically be given the death penalty for the charges, although many observers say that is unlikely as the party will not want to make a martyr of a man whose left-leaning social welfare policies won much popular support.

Two legal experts told Reuters they thought that the details of the actual charges laid against Bo suggested he would be spared the death penalty.

"It was other people who took the money," said Gu Yushu, a lawyer who Bo's sister originally wanted as his lawyer, but was not allowed to retain.

"The direct link to him is not very clear," added Gu, who thought a 15 year sentence could be expected.

Shang Baojun, a prominent human rights lawyer, agreed that capital punishment was legally unlikely as Bo was not directly linked to Heywood's murder, and praised Bo's performance in court, even if he thought it would not likely affect the verdict.

"He spoke very fluently, very passionately, but whether it was enough to convince anyone is another question," Shang said. "He was obviously very well prepared by his defense team. He knew his talking points to a tee."

The trial has heard many salacious allegations against Bo, with transcripts, although probably edited, being carried on the court's official microblog.

The prosecution has alleged that Bo took more than 20 million yuan ($3.27 million) in bribes from two businessmen, embezzled another 5 million yuan from a government building project, and abused his power in trying to cover up Gu's crime.

Details have been presented of a villa on the French Riviera bought for the Bo family by businessman Xu Ming, who also paid for foreign trips by Bo and Gu's only son, Bo Guagua, offering a glimpse into the lifestyles of China's elite politicians.

Bo said that he had initially admitted to Communist Party anti-corruption investigators that he received bribes as he had been "under psychological pressure".

Bo also said he been framed by one of the men accused of bribing him, businessman Tang Xiaolin, who he called a "mad dog".

The prosecutor said Bo's lack of contrition would count against him.

"The severeness of the accused's crimes, and that he refused to admit guilt, don't match the circumstances of leniency, and (he) must be severely punished in accordance with the law."

Bo said he had offered his confession about accepting bribes from Tang because he wanted to "cooperate, to get the understanding" of the party, which at the time was leading the investigation into him.

"At the time, I had a spark of hope, I hoped to keep my party membership, to keep my political life," Bo said, according to the court's transcript.

There was no mention in the transcript of Bo's previous assertion of being pressured to confess, although he said he had felt "under pressure" throughout the entire investigation into him.

Bo also provided a new explanation for why Wang - who has accused Bo of punching him upon the news of Gu's involvement in Heywood's murder - fled to the U.S. consulate.

"He was secretly in love with Gu Kailai," Bo said, adding that Gu had rejected the former police chief. "He muscled in on my home, on my feelings, which is the real reason for his defection."

Despite Bo's gutsy defense, a guilty verdict is a foregone conclusion as China's courts are controlled by the Communist Party. State media, which speaks for the party, has already all but condemned him.



headline: Tens of thousands of Filipinos protest "pork barrel" funds
byline: By Rosemarie Francisco
6:20pm EDT

Tens of thousands of Filipinos angry at official corruption marched through the center of Manila and other cities to demand the abolition of a misused fund for legislators' pet projects, the biggest protest aimed at Benigno Aquino's government.

Aquino came to office in 2010 on a good governance and anti-corruption platform and consistently enjoys popularity ratings of more than 70 percent, but the Philippines remains one of the most corrupt countries in East Asia.

Protesters, responding to a call to wear white, converged on Manila's largest park angry at the misuse of "pork barrel" funds under the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF).

The money is frequently channeled to projects solely to impress voters, though many have turned out to be non-existent.

Aquino said on Friday the government would plug leaks in the fund, an announcement appeared timed to preempt Monday's march, and a presidential spokesman said the protesters and government wanted the same thing.

"The message is clear - we are on the same side. We are against corruption," spokesman Edwin Lacierda told reporters.

But the protesters disagreed. Church and civic groups, health workers, students and entire families ignored Aquino's promise to overhaul the PDAF and called for its abolition.

"Just transfer the funds to department agencies delivering services," said Jun Bernandino, a quadriplegic who joined the march. "They are lawmakers, not service providers. Give the agencies enough budget to deliver the services the people need."

Police said around 60,000 protesters thronged Luneta Park, some wearing pig masks and headgear. Others carried banners saying "Scrap pork barrel" and "No to pork".

Organizers had hoped for a million to join the protest which is not expected to hurt Aquino's popularity.

Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle, the charismatic archbishop of Manila who many thought a strong candidate to become pope during this year's Vatican conclave, joined the protest saying it was time for the government to show greatness.

About 5,000 left-wing rallyists took the protest to the nearby presidential palace while a few thousand stayed at the park waiting for a free concert organized by one of the protest groups. About 1,500 police were deployed, but no incidents were reported.

Civic groups called the protest after a state audit showed some lawmakers had funneled 10 billion pesos ($226 million) in total to non-existent projects and groups under the previous government of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who has since been charged with plunder and electoral fraud.

Thousands of Bahrainis were allowed to march peacefully outside Manama calling for democratic reforms on Friday, 10 days after police cracked down on scattered protests organized by an online group inspired by recent demonstrations in Egypt.

Waving Bahrain's red and white flag and carrying pictures of political prisoners, the protesters denounced King Hamad bin Issa al-Khalifa and Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa. "Down with Hamad," they chanted.

"We are here ... because we want freedom. We are used to oppression, and teargas and beatings," said Hayat al-Abbar, a 38-year-old secretary who joined the march.

Bahrain, which hosts the U.S. Fifth Fleet, has been buffeted by bouts of unrest since February 2011 when an uprising led by the Shi'ite majority demanded the Sunni al-Khalifa dynasty give up power.

The authorities crushed the revolt. An international inquiry commission said in a November 2011 report that 35 people had died during the uprising. The dead were mainly protesters but included five security personnel and seven foreigners.

"We seek our freedom and dignity and will never forget those who sacrificed their lives," Friday's protesters chanted.

Police stayed away from the march, which was organized by the country's main opposition parties and took place west of the capital.

The Bahrain government in July passed a law banning all protests in the capital Manama. King Hamad also toughened penalties in anti-terrorism laws.

On August 14, the authorities fired tear gas and birdshot to disperse demonstrators responding to an online call for street action by a new activist group calling itself Tamarrod, according to witnesses.

The group was inspired by the movement of the same name that helped muster massive protests against Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi before the military removed him on July 3.

The Bahrain opposition demands a constitutional monarchy with a government chosen from within a democratically-elected parliament. It complains of discrimination against majority Shi'ites in areas such as employment and public services, which the government denies.

"Where are the jobs? ... We will not bow to anyone but god. We are not scared of anyone and I'm ready to die for my country," said Abdelghani al-Marzouq, a 51-year-old engineer who was at the demonstration.

The leader of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood was beaten by police during his arrest, and his trial is part of an attempt by the military to eliminate its political foes, a defense lawyer said on Sunday.

The trial of Mohamed Badie, the Brotherhood's "General Guide", and his two deputies opened on Sunday but was immediately adjourned until October 29 for security reasons.

Badie and other leaders of Egypt's oldest Islamist group were arrested after army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi deposed the freely elected President Mohamed Mursi on July 3 after mass protests. The army has installed a civilian government to rule pending a new constitution and a fresh vote.

Sitting at the lawyers' club by the Nile after the hearing, the lawyer, Mohamed Gharib, said Badie refused to recognize the authority of the judiciary after Mursi's removal or to answer questions during his interrogation in jail last week.

"As soon as General Sisi finished his speech on July 3, in which he announced the suspension of the constitution and the appointment of an interim president ... Khairat al-Shater, Saad Katatni, Rashad Bayoumy and Mohammed Mehdi Akef were arrested," said Gharib, referring to some of the senior Brotherhood officials now behind bars.

"This shows that the leaders of the bloody military coup want to get rid of their political foes."

Egypt's judges fiercely defend their independence.

Bayoumy and Shater went on trial alongside Badie on Sunday.

FALSE TEETH KNOCKED OUT

Gharib said 70-year-old Badie, a veterinarian by profession, had his false teeth knocked out during his arrest last week and does not have access to his blood pressure medication in jail.

"Badie had his place of residence ... raided and was beaten and insulted with language insulting his mother and father and their honor," said Gharib.

Pictures issued of Badie soon after his arrest last week did not appear to show serious injuries.

More than 900 people, including about 100 soldiers and police, have been killed since security forces broke up two pro-Mursi protest camps on August 14. Brotherhood supporters say the real death toll is far higher and among those killed was Badie's son, Ammar, a 38-year-old computer engineer.

Gharib accused the prosecution of investigating the victims instead of the perpetrators. He said prosecutors had also failed to present credible evidence to the defense team.

"Justice has been turned upside down," he said. "The real victims are being hauled to jails and accused of inciting killing though (Badie's) own son has been killed."

The state accuses the Brotherhood of "terrorism" and subversion. Police stations and churches across Egypt have come under attack from what the state says are Islamist assailants.

Charges against Badie and his aides include incitement to violence in connection with anti-Brotherhood protests before Mursi's overthrow.

The Brotherhood says it does not condone violence.

Gharib said lawyers had been present when prosecutors questioned the defendants at Tora prison, where Badie and others are held, for two days.

He said that after arresting Badie and his colleagues, authorities took them directly to prison, where they have been questioned, rather than the normal practice of referring them to the prosecutor's office within 24 hours.

"So if the defendant is taken from his home to prison this is ... a breach of the legal principle of the presumption of innocence," Gharib said.

clean image in the $14.5 billion China market.

The stepped-up monitoring of microblogging site Weibo and local online forums reflects the outsized role social media plays in China, where access to information is restricted. Chatter about food safety scares spreads lightning-fast on Twitter-like Weibo, so companies are learning to keep constant tabs on their online brand reputation.

"We work with a number of clients in this sector and we've been busy, very busy, over the last couple of weeks," said a China-based senior executive at a social media analytics firm.

He asked not to be identified because the firm is currently working with industry brands including those owned by Fonterra Co-Operative Group Ltd, Danone SA and Nestle SA.

Earlier this month, five international milk powder firms and one Chinese company were fined a record $110 million after a probe into price fixing in the sector, while a botulism scare at New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra tarnished the wider reputation of imported milk powder.

Reuters analyzed the frequency of Weibo posts mentioning the major infant formula brands and found that the number of posts began to increase as early as May, and then peaked at the start of August, around the time of the Fonterra botulism scare.

The earlier spikes could be explained by the spread of rumors around the milk powder price probe, which was publicly disclosed in July but had been in the works for four months. The viral nature of social media can also amplify the chatter without necessarily reflecting wider consumer thinking because a single message can be re-posted thousands of times.

Nestle, which was named in the pricing probe but escaped a fine, saw the smallest spike in online chatter about its Wyeth infant formula unit, which flattened in July and August. Mentions of Mead Johnson Nutrition Co spiked the most, peaking in June, but then returned close to normal this month.

The frequency of posts about Dumex and Abbott Laboratories, which makes brands such as Similac, remained elevated into August, suggesting the firms may have work to do to reassure consumers.

Chatter about Fonterra, which doesn't have its own-label brand in China, was little affected by the earlier price probes, but saw a sudden steep spike in August at the time of the botulism scare. In August alone, posts that mention Fonterra were five times those in January to July.

Nestle and Danone declined to comment. Mead Johnson, Wyeth and Fonterra did not respond to emailed queries.

Late last year, a Fonterra source told Reuters that social media in China was going to be a priority. Abbott said it is stepping up social media engagement worldwide.

"Our use of social media is increasing globally as we look to better understand, respond to and connect with our customers around the world," Abbott spokeswoman Kelly Morrison said.

DIGITAL RESPONSE

Chinese consumers are highly sensitive to dairy safety after a scandal in 2008 involving melamine-contaminated baby milk powder. At least six babies died and thousands more fell ill.

For the international infant formula brands, the recent scandals hit a particularly sensitive spot: their reputation for safety, which was their primary edge over local rivals.

"The picture that is being painted in China is that their quality isn't that much better that local firms," said Torsten Stocker, Hong Kong-based partner at consulting firm AT Kearney.

The social data company executive said that infant formula companies had made use of online media to gauge consumer sentiment, track the spread of conversations related to their brands, and work out how to respond to the crisis.

"There was one brand which was holding out and didn't admit involvement until the very end. That made Chinese netizens angry. Other brands did better, responding quickly and getting opinion leaders to support the brand online," he said.

Consultants will now create detailed reports using the data to identify weak-spots of brands through the crisis, helping milk powder makers create tailored recovery drives, he said, adding that some firms asked for updates four times a day.

Milk powder makers are also using analysis of online Chinese retailer Taobao, owned by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, to map out demand hotspots in China's multitude of lower-tier cities where analysts predict 80 percent of sector growth.

China has more than 150 cities with a population above 1 million, and the major Western brands have yet to establish coast-to-coast distribution channels.

"Many firms are looking at Taobao, which is a good indicator because it tells you where demand is, but where the physical infrastructure hasn't yet reached," said Jeff Walters, managing director at Boston Consulting Group, which advises a number of milk powder firms in China.

Global infant formula firms in China have traditionally benefited from high prices and a domestic sector dogged by safety fears, but analysts said the recent turmoil could mark the start of a more challenging period for firms in China.

Chinese authorities are also looking to consolidate the sector and create stronger local champions, which means they will be taking on fewer but more formidable competitors.

"Now companies are going to have to get a lot smarter. They're going have to come up with the right pricing, the right brand image and focus on far better distribution," said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group.

headline: U.N. experts in Syria to visit site of poison gas attack
byline: By William Maclean
6:20pm EDT

U.N. weapons experts are due on Monday to inspect a site where poison gas killed many hundreds of people in Damascus suburbs, amid calls from Western capitals for military action to punish the world's worst apparent chemical weapons attack in 25 years.

Syria agreed on Sunday to allow the inspectors to visit the site. The United States and its allies say evidence has been destroyed by government shelling of the area over the past five days, and the Syrian offer to allow inspectors came too late.

Washington has faced calls for action in response to Wednesday's attack, which came a year after President Barack Obama declared use of chemical weapons to be a "red line" which would require a firm response.

Obama has been reluctant to intervene in Syria's 2-1/2-year-old conflict and U.S. officials stressed that he has yet to make a decision on how to respond. A senior senator, Republican Bob Corker, said on Sunday he believed Obama would ask Congress for authorization to use force when lawmakers return from summer recess next month.

A senior official of the U.S. administration said there was little doubt the Syrian government had gassed its own civilians.

The White House said Obama and French President Francois Hollande "discussed possible responses by the international community".

British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed that "such an attack demanded a firm response from the international community," Cameron's office said.

Syria watchers said the government's decision to allow the inspections may have been an attempt to stave off intervention.

"My view is that the Syrian government's apparent agreement to the U.N. inspection has been triggered by the growing possibility of military action," said Malcolm Chalmers, Research Director at the Britain's Royal United Services Institute.

"I think that is why they are doing it."

In London, Foreign Secretary William Hague said evidence of a chemical attack could have already been destroyed by subsequent artillery shelling in the areas or degraded in the days following the strike.

"We have to be realistic now about what the U.N. team can achieve," he told reporters.

CEASEFIRE DURING INSPECTIONS

The United Nations said Damascus had agreed to a ceasefire while the U.N. experts are at the site for inspections.

Syria confirmed it had agreed to allow access to the inspectors, who arrived in Syria to investigate smaller chemical weapons allegations just three days before the huge incident, which occurred before dawn after a night of heavy bombardment.

Medicins sans Frontieres says at least 355 people were reported dead in three hospitals from symptoms of poisoning. President Bashar al-Assad's opponents have given death tolls ranging from 500 to well over 1,000.

The experts' mandate is to find out whether chemical weapons were used, not to assign blame, but the evidence they collect, for example about the missile used, can provide a strong indication about the identity of the party responsible.

If the U.N. team obtains independent evidence, it could be easier to build an international diplomatic case for intervention. Former weapons investigators say every hour matters.

The team has been waiting in a Damascus luxury hotel a few miles from the site of what appears to have been the world's worst chemical weapons attack since Saddam Hussein's forces gassed thousands of Iraqi Kurds in 1988.

Syria's information minister said any U.S. military action would "create a ball of fire that will inflame the Middle East".

He said Damascus had evidence chemical arms were used by rebels fighting to topple Assad, not by his government. Western states say they believe the rebels lack access to poison gas or weapons that could deliver it.

Assad's closest ally Iran, repeating Obama's own previous rhetoric, said the United States should not cross a "red line" by attacking Syria.

Assad ally Russia, which has suggested rebels may have been behind the chemical attack, said it would be a "tragic mistake" to jump to conclusions over who was responsible.

Two and a half years since the start of a war that has already killed more than 100,000 people, the United States and its allies have yet to take direct action, despite long ago saying Assad must be removed from power.

There was a time when the U.S. National Security Agency was so secretive that government officials dared not speak its name in public. NSA, the joke went, stood for "No Such Agency."

That same agency this month held an on-the-record conference call with reporters, issued a lengthy press release to rebut a newspaper story, and posted documents on a newly launched open website - icontherecord.tumblr.com (which stands for intelligence community on the record).

The steps were taken under pressure as President Barack Obama's administration tries to calm a public storm over disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that the surveillance agency and its British counterpart scoop up far more Internet and phone data than previously known.

The NSA's moves out of the shadows were meant to show that it operates lawfully and fixes mistakes when they are detected, but not everyone is convinced that it is a fundamental shift toward more openness at the intelligence agencies.

Some steps toward openness were unprecedented.

The government for the first time released opinions - previously labeled Top Secret - from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which never publicly airs its decisions on the electronic eavesdropping and communications collection by the NSA.

The move came despite resistance from some Justice Department lawyers and some NSA and CIA officials concerned about the amount of unredacted material going public in the three FISA Court opinions released, U.S. sources told Reuters.

In the end, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made the decision on how much material was released from the previously secret court opinions.

"There is no disagreement across the community with regard to whether or not we need to be more transparent and it is just a question of determining how far we can safely go," Shawn Turner, DNI spokesman, said.

Obama and other officials have said the NSA surveillance programs are lawful, have been approved by Congress and the FISA Court, and are aimed at detecting and disrupting terrorist plots.

The FISA court said the NSA may unintentionally have collected as many as 56,000 emails of Americans a year from 2008 to 2011 and may have violated the Constitution before adjustments were made.

Some analysts said intelligence agencies had not necessarily entered a brand new world of public displays of information.

"I wouldn't call it a seismic shift towards a greater transparency. The federal government put these documents out under duress," said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.

"The problem is they just keep releasing materials bit by bit and so the scandal never goes away."

Recent efforts by U.S. intelligence agencies to appear more open follow earlier comments by top-level officials that in hindsight raised questions of veracity.

Clapper was asked at a congressional hearing in March whether the NSA collected any type of data on millions of Americans to which he responded: "No sir."

After the Snowden revelations were published in June, Clapper told NBC his response at the hearing had been given in the "most truthful, or least untruthful, manner."

General Keith Alexander, director of the NSA, told Reuters in May that the agency had no interest in reading the emails of U.S. citizens, and quipped: "The great irony is we're the only ones not spying on the American people."

Government officials are loath to say that Snowden's disclosures prompted greater openness, but analysts say it did have an effect.

"The amount of knowledge that people now have about what NSA does means that we can't simply pretend it doesn't exist. That's where Snowden changed things," said James Lewis, a senior fellow, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

To make the disclosed NSA programs palatable to the public, more openness is required, he said. "There is a link between transparency and accountability and political acceptance."

Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the organization was pleased with the recent release of documents and hoped the government would release more in the coming weeks.

But it should not be viewed as a huge shift toward transparency by the administration, said Jaffer, whose group has also sued the federal government for more information on its use of unmanned drones.

"In fact, on the same day the president promised more transparency on surveillance issues, the CIA filed a brief in one of our 'targeted killing' cases arguing that it could not release legal memos about the drone program, could not release civilian casualty numbers, and for that matter could not even acknowledge that the agency had played any role in targeted killings," Jaffer said.

headline: Muslim Brotherhood leaders, Mubarak face trial in Egypt
byline: By Alistair Lyon
6:20pm EDT

foe Hosni Mubarak faced separate trials on Sunday on similar charges of involvement in the killing of protesters.

With Egypt now under an army-installed government after last month's overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi, local media seized on the symbolism of scheduling both sessions on the same day. "Trial of two regimes," headlined al-Shorouk daily.

In the end, Mohamed Badie, the Brotherhood's "General Guide", and his deputies did not appear at the opening of their trial for security reasons, a judicial source said. Citing their absence, the judge adjourned the proceedings until October 29.

The case against Badie, Khairat al-Shater and Rashad Bayoumy relates to unrest before the army removed Mursi on July 3 and detained him in an undisclosed location.

More than 1,000 people, including about 100 soldiers and police, have died in violence across Egypt since Mursi's fall, making it the bloodiest civil unrest in the republic's 60-year history. Brotherhood supporters say the toll is much higher.

Mubarak, who left prison on Thursday after judges ordered his release, appeared in a courtroom cage in a wheelchair, wearing sunglasses and dressed in white, along with his jailed sons, Gamal and Alaa, and the former interior minister, Habib al-Adly.

After a hearing that lasted about three hours, the judge set the next session for September 14, pending further investigation.

The former president was sentenced to life in prison last year for complicity in the killing of protesters during the 2011 revolt against him, but an appeals court ordered a retrial.

A helicopter flew Mubarak to the court in the Police Academy on the eastern outskirts of Cairo from a military hospital where he was placed under house arrest after his release from jail.

The government used a state of emergency it declared earlier this month to place Mubarak under house arrest, apparently to forestall any public anger if he had simply walked free.

Mubarak-era prime minister Ahmed Nazif was released earlier this year because of a limit on pre-trial detention. Former Housing Minister Ibrahim Soliman, sentenced to eight years in jail on corruption charges after the 2011 uprising, was released on Sunday pending his appeal, judicial sources said.

The trial of the Brotherhood leaders signals that Egypt's new rulers intend to crush what they have portrayed as a violent, terrorist group bent on subverting the state.

The Brotherhood, which won five successive post-Mubarak votes, says it is a peaceful movement unjustly targeted by the generals who ousted Mursi, Egypt's first freely elected leader.

The military contends it was responding to the people's will, citing vast demonstrations against Mursi, who was criticized for accumulating excessive power, pushing a partisan Islamist agenda and mismanaging the economy.

BROTHERHOOD IN DISARRAY

Charges against Badie and his aides include incitement to violence in connection with an anti-Brotherhood protest near the group's Cairo headquarters on June 30 in which nine people were killed and 91 wounded. The 70-year-old Brotherhood chief was detained last week. Shater and Bayoumy were picked up earlier.

Mohamed Gharib, one of the lawyers defending the three Brotherhood leaders, said the trial was less an effort to try the suspects on the facts of the case than an attempt by the military to "get rid of its political foes".

Gharib said Badie had been beaten during his arrest, losing his false teeth and glasses in the process, though pictures issued soon after his arrest did not show serious injuries.

"Justice has been turned upside down. The real victims are being hauled to jails and accused of inciting killing," he said.

Pro-Mursi crowds staged small marches on Friday, but the Brotherhood's street power appears to have faded after the round-up of its leaders and the bloody dispersal of protest camps set up in Cairo to demand the president's reinstatement.

A pro-Mursi alliance known as the National Coalition to Support Legitimacy and Reject the Coup called for a campaign of civil disobedience to paralyze Egypt, "retake the revolution" and reverse the army takeover.

A day earlier, in a sign of confidence, the government relaxed a night-time curfew, saying it would start at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), instead of 7 p.m. The month-long curfew was imposed on August 14, the day the pro-Mursi protest vigils were stormed. Banks and financial institutions are working normally again.

Castigating foes of the army, a spokesman for interim President Adly Mansour said Egypt had undergone difficulties in the past two months, but had reached a "safe area".

"Those who tried and are still trying to break the Egyptian army will fall alongside the Tatars and Crusaders and all other enemies in the same dustbin," said Ahmed al-Muslimani.

The army has announced a roadmap back to democracy that involves revising the constitution adopted under Mursi in late 2012, with parliamentary and presidential elections to follow.

Changes proposed by a government-appointed legal panel would scrap last year's Islamic additions to the constitution and revive a Mubarak-era voting system. Islamists and liberals have expressed alarm about the suggestions.

Egyptian authorities arrested an Islamist militant, saying he was close to the brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri and had supplied arms to Mursi's supporters.

Security sources said the authorities described the man, Daoud Khairat, as the "right-hand man" of Mohamed al-Zawahri, who was himself arrested in Egypt on August 17. The Brotherhood denies using firearms and says it has no links to al Qaeda.

Earlier, the army said it had captured five militants in Sheikh Zuweid, a town in North Sinai, saying they had been involved in attacks on security forces in the area.

A son of senior Brotherhood politician Mohamed al-Beltagi was also detained in the southern city of Beni Suef, the security sources said, in a continuing wave of arrests.

headline: U.S. says Syria offer to show chemical attack sites 'too late'
byline: By Mark Felsenthal and Susan Cornwell
6:20pm EDT

A U.S. military response to alleged chemical weapons attacks in Syria appeared more likely on Sunday after Washington dismissed the Syrian government's offer to allow U.N. inspection of the sites as "too late to be credible."

A senior official of the U.S. administration said there was little doubt the Syrian government had used chemical weapons against civilians in suburbs of Damascus last week and that President Barack Obama was weighing how to respond.

A year ago, Obama said the use of chemical weapons in Syria's war would be a "red line" for the United States. However, Obama has been reluctant to intervene in Syria and U.S. officials stressed that he has yet to make a decision on how to respond.

U.S. lawmakers from both political parties urged a limited American military response, such as cruise missile strikes, but a senior Democrat, Senator Jack Reed, cautioned that any move by Washington should not be unilateral.

Senator Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he had discussed the issue with the administration in the past week and believed Obama would ask Congress for authorization for intervention once Congress returns from its recess on September9.

"I think we will respond in a surgical way and I hope the president as soon as we get back to Washington will ask for authorization from Congress to do something in a very surgical and proportional way," he told Fox News Sunday.

Assad used chemical weapons, a Reuters/Ipsos poll says.

About 60 percent of those surveyed in the poll said the United States should not intervene, meaning Obama would have to make a convincing case to the American public for any action that he would decide to take.

Russia on Sunday warned the United States against repeating the "mistakes of the past" in Syria, saying any U.S. action should not bypass the United Nations. Iran, another key ally of Assad, said Washington should not cross a "red line" by attacking Syria, while Syria's information minister said any U.S. military action would "create a ball of fire."

INADEQUATE OFFER

The Syrian Foreign Ministry said on Sunday it had agreed to allow U.N. inspectors access to sites in suburbs of Damascus where the alleged chemical attacks are said to have occurred last week.

The senior U.S. official made clear the Syrian government's move was inadequate, saying that if the Syrians had nothing to hide they would have let the inspectors in five days ago after the attack was first reported.

"At this juncture, any belated decision by the regime to grant access to the U.N. team would be considered too late to be credible, including because the evidence available has been significantly corrupted as a result of the regime's persistent shelling and other intentional actions over the last five days," the official said.

"Based on the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, witness accounts, and other facts gathered by open sources, the U.S. intelligence community, and international partners, there is very little doubt at this point that a chemical weapon was used by the Syrian regime against civilians in this incident," the official told Reuters.

"We are continuing to assess the facts so the president can make an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use of chemical weapons," the official said.

Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Obama would have to make a strong case to Americans for any intervention.

"He (Obama) hasn't prepared the American public for the strategic issues that are coming out of Syria," he said. "I think something will change when he does that."

The president and his top military and national security advisers hashed out options on Saturday. Obama also spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron and agreed that chemical weapon use by Assad's forces would merit a "serious response".

While several U.S. lawmakers called for a limited U.S. military response, Reed, a senior senator in Obama's Democratic Party and of the of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned this should not be unilateral.

"This has to be an international operation, it can't be a unilateral American approach," he said on CBS television's Face the Nation show. He added that Washington could not get into a "general military operation in Syria."

Lawmakers favoring military action included Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "I certainly would do cruise missile strikes," he told Fox News.

Such "stand-off" strikes that could be fired at Syria from a distance, such as from ships in the Mediterranean, were also urged by Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. However, House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, a Republican, told CBS there was "no guarantee" that such strikes could destroy all of Syria's chemical weapons.

headline: Indian police round up all five suspects in Mumbai rape case
byline: By Matthias Williams
6:20pm EDT

rape of a photo journalist in Mumbai last week, a senior official said on Sunday, in a case that has revived uncomfortable questions about women's safety.

News of the attack on Thursday sparked street protests and uproar in parliament, a reaction reminiscent of the outcry that followed the rape and murder of a student in New Delhi in December.

Authorities vowed to get tougher on sex crimes in response to the December rape and police have promised swift and severe justice for those responsible for the latest assault.

The arrests followed a manhunt by 20 police teams who fanned out across Mumbai and beyond to hunt for five young men suspected of carrying out the rape of the journalist in an abandoned Mumbai textile mill.

Sadanand Date, a joint commissioner of Mumbai police, told Reuters that the last two suspects had been arrested, including one detained in the capital New Delhi, hundreds of miles north of Mumbai. New Delhi police declined to comment.

The gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in New Delhi in December set off a wave of protests and debate about the safety of women in a society that has remained largely patriarchal despite two decades of accelerating economic growth.

The victim of the Mumbai assault, whose name cannot be disclosed in India for legal reasons, was in a stable condition in hospital where she said she wanted to get back to work.

"Rape is not the end of life. I want strictest punishment for all the accused and want to join duty as early as possible," the CNN-IBN television channel quoted the victim as saying, in a statement made from her hospital bed.

The woman was on assignment with a male colleague at the mill in Lower Parel, an up-and-coming district in India's financial capital where trendy bars and offices have sprouted where factories once stood.

The two were separated by the attackers and her colleague was tied up with a belt and beaten while she was assaulted, police said on Friday.

The grandmother of one of the suspects told television channels that her grandson was a minor. One of those suspected of carrying out the December rape in New Delhi is being tried separately in a juvenile court.

India introduced tougher rape laws in March in response to the December attack, and they include the death penalty for repeat offenders and for those whose victims were left in a "vegetative state".

India has a clutch of powerful women politicians including Sonia Gandhi, the chief of the ruling Congress party and arguably the country's most powerful lawmaker.

But the realities for many Indian women stand in grim contrast. Statistics show that a woman is raped every twenty minutes in India and discrimination against girls and female foeticide are common.



headline: Merkel tries to reassure nervous German voters over Greece
byline: By Madeline Chambers
6:20pm EDT

German Chancellor Angela Merkel sought to reassure voters on Sunday that Greece would not need a debt writedown but left open the option of more aid for Athens as she struggled to contain a dispute which could hurt her in next month's election.

Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble provoked a storm last week when he told a campaign rally that a new rescue for Greece was inevitable in comments that contradicted Merkel, who has said it is too early to discuss additional aid. The subject has dominated the election campaign ever since.

Merkel has tried to keep Greece out of her campaign to avoid angering Germans who fear they will foot the bill for more bailouts. She is tipped to win a third term in the September 22 poll partly because voters approve of her management of the euro zone crisis and her tough line with struggling states.

The chancellor on Sunday did not rule out a further Greek bailout, saying the euro zone would look again at the situation in the country in 2014, but she told Focus magazine that she did not see a debt haircut for Greece.

Asked if she would see things more clearly after the election, she said: "The election has nothing to do with it. I am expressly warning against a haircut. It could create a domino effect of uncertainty ... in the euro zone."

Many Germans are even more concerned about the direct hit they would take from a debt writedown than a third Greek bailout which would probably be far smaller than the previous rescues, though both are unpopular options.

As Europe's largest economy, Germany has the most exposure to Greece. Merkel could lose out if voters think she is being less than honest about Greek risks.

Private owners of Greek debt were forced to swallow significant losses on their holdings last year, but European governments and the European Central Bank have refused to take a hit so far. Germany has argued a writedown of Greek debt held by euro zone governments would be illegal.

A poll on Sunday showed that Merkel's centre-right coalition had lost its slender lead over parties on the left. If she is unable to continue her alliance with the Free Democrats (FDP), she may seek a "grand coalition" with the Social Democrats (SPD).

"SLEEPING TABLETS"

Opposition parties, who have long accused Merkel of hiding from German voters the truth that they will at some point have to pump more money into the euro zone, have seized on the issue.

Merkel's SPD rival Peer Steinbrueck said he would press her on the issue in coming weeks, including in a television debate in a week's time.

"(The government) has handed out sleeping tablets and tried to hush up the fact that the stabilization of the euro zone will have a cost," Steinbrueck told the Suedwest Presse newspaper.

Pollsters, however, say while the issue of Greece is dangerous for Merkel, opposition parties may not benefit as they have backed the bailouts in parliament.

On Sunday, Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said his country may need a further 10 billion euros in extra support from its euro zone partners but would not expect any loan to come with conditions attached.

Analysts have long predicted Greece will need more aid, albeit on a smaller scale than previous bailouts totaling about 240 billion euros. The IMF estimated last month Greece would face a funding gap of nearly 11 billion euros for 2014-2015.

Stournaras also ruled out another haircut, the most toxic question for German voters.

Schaeuble was bombarded by questions on the issue on Sunday at a news conference with ordinary citizens, as part of a government "open day".

He once again ruled out a debt writedown but reiterated the government's stance that Greece's partners would "decide on further measures" in 2014 if they were needed. "The truth is that it is highly probably that it will come to that," he said.

ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen, a German, also warned that a debate about a second debt writedown was damaging.

"The repeated discussion distracts from what must be done for budget consolidation and more growth under the current program," Asmussen told Die Welt am Sonntag weekly.

Some economists, however, think a haircut may be unavoidable eventually. Germany's commissioner to the European Commission, Guenther Oettinger, said on Saturday he would not rule it out in the long run.

A bomb tore through the side of a bus carrying Yemeni air force personnel to their base in the capital Sanaa on Sunday, killing at least one officer and wounding several others, state media reported.

Witnesses told Reuters that as many as six people died when the device, planted on the vehicle, exploded and blew passengers' bodies into the street, but that higher toll could not be immediately confirmed.

Separately, Yemeni police said they foiled a plot to carry out a suicide bombing inside a U.S. language institute in Sanaa. An institute spokesman denied the report, saying a small incident involving the arrest of a motorcyclist trying to travel on a closed road that had been blown out of proportion.

The impoverished country, situated next to the world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia, is battling a number of armed groups, including al Qaeda fighters who Washington said this month could be planning attacks.

Yemen's security personnel have been targeted by Islamist militants although most of the attacks have taken place in the largely lawless south and east of the Arabian Peninsula state.

Regarding Sunday's bombing, the air force spokesman told Saba news agency: "This cowardly terrorist act resulted in the martyrdom of one person and injured a number of others, several of whom are in a serious condition. They have all been transferred to hospital.".

Saba named the dead man as Sergeant Mohammed al-Shaghdari.

Air force officer Ameen Saree, who was among the first to reach the scene, earlier said the blast killed at least six people and wounded 26.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

Later on Sunday, a Yemeni police spokesman and a counter-terrorism official said security forces had detained a suspected al Qaeda militant trying to infiltrate the Yemen-American Language Institute (YALI) on a motorcycle.

The police spokesman said the man was found to be carrying an explosives belt and was detained when he tried to enter the compound posing as a student seeking to register for English courses. Another official said the man had been referred to the counter-terrorism department for further questioning.

A YALI spokesman said the report was untrue.

He said that a Yemeni motorcyclist was detained when he tried to pass on a road closed to traffic for security reasons near the institute and refused to heed demands to turn back.

Yemen has been gripped by turmoil since pro-democracy demonstrations erupted in early 2011 against then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who stepped down last year.

Suspected al Qaeda militants killed four Yemeni soldiers during an August 11 attack on forces guarding the country's only liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in the southern province of Shabwa.

In May 2012 a suicide bomber in army uniform killed more than 90 soldiers rehearsing for a parade in the heart of Sanaa.

Earlier this month, Yemeni authorities said that had thwarted a plot by al Qaeda to seize two major oil and gas export terminals and a city in the east of the country.

The United States and other Western powers shut their diplomatic missions across the Middle East, Africa and Asia after Washington said it had information about unspecified terrorist threats. Most legations have since reopened.

Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe threatened on Sunday to retaliate "tit for tat" against companies from Britain and the United States if these Western powers persisted in pressuring his government with sanctions and what he called "harassment".

Mugabe's latest verbal broadside against his main Western critics followed their questioning of his re-election in a July 31 vote that his rival Morgan Tsvangirai has denounced as a "coup by ballot" involving alleged widespread vote-rigging.

Mugabe, who at 89 is Africa's oldest leader, has rejected the fraud allegations and was sworn in on Thursday for a fresh five-year term in the southern African nation that he has ruled since its independence from Britain in 1980.

"They should not continue to harass us, the British and Americans," he told supporters at the funeral of an air force officer.

"We have not done anything to their companies here, the British have several companies in this country, and we have not imposed any controls, any sanctions against them, but time will come when we will say well, tit for tat, you hit me I hit you."

British companies in Zimbabwe include banking groups Standard Chartered Plc and Barclays Plc. These are already indigenizationthe target of a so-called "indigenisation" policy that requires they cede a majority stake to black Zimbabweans.

Mugabe and prominent members of his ZANU-PF party, which won a two-thirds majority in the July 31 election, are the targets of financial and travel sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. These were applied by Washington and Brussels to punish alleged election-rigging and abuses of power.

Britain said last week Mugabe's re-election could not be deemed credible without an independent investigation into allegations of voting irregularities.

U.S. officials also said the July 31 election was flawed and Washington had no plans to loosen sanctions until there were signs of change in the country.

In contrast, observers from the regional 15-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union broadly endorsed last month's Zimbabwean vote as free and peaceful and called on all parties to accept its results.

Mugabe still enjoys support in Africa for his role in the liberation guerrilla war that helped end white-minority rule in what was formerly Rhodesia, and led to its independence.

headline: Oman's Qaboos on Tehran visit, U.S.-Iran mediation in focus
byline: By Yeganeh Torbati
6:20pm EDT

Oman's Sultan Qaboos on Sunday began the first visit to Iran by a foreign leader since moderate President Hassan Rouhani took office and Iranian media said his trip might be an effort to mediate between Tehran and Washington.

Oman, a Gulf Arab state that maintains unusually friendly ties with both the United States and Iran, has previously been an important go-between for the two countries that severed diplomatic relations in 1980 and are in a protracted stand-off over the disputed Iranian nuclear program.

The West suspects the Islamic Republic is working to develop a nuclear arms capability, an accusation Iran denies, and has brought about increasingly strict international sanctions against Tehran.

President Barack Obama's administration has said Washington is open to direct talks with Iran to resolve the nuclear and other disputes, and Iranian officials have not ruled them out.

The landslide election of Rouhani, who took office on August 3, has raised hopes of a negotiated settlement to the nuclear dispute and an end to sanctions that have halved Iran's oil exports since 2011 and put immense pressure on the economy.

"It can be guessed that the Sultan of Oman's trip to Iran can mean that afterward this country, instead of playing the role of mediator in relation to Iran and America, wants to play the role of host for these two countries with regard to negotiations," Qassem Mohebali, an Iranian analyst on the Middle East, wrote in the reformist Bahar newspaper on Sunday.

Oman helped broker the release of three American hikers detained in Iran in 2011 and an Iranian scientist held in California on charges of violating U.S. sanctions this year.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sought to play down reports that Qaboos was visiting Iran with a message from the White House.

"We are not aware that the Sultan of Oman will be carrying a particular message for our country," Zarif was quoted as saying on Sunday by ISNA news agency. Rather, bilateral relations and regional issues would be on the agenda, he said.

Mehran Kamrava, director of the Center for International and Regional Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar, said Qaboos' visit indicated Iran was coming out of the "isolationist mode" it had adopted under Rouhani's predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was known for bellicose rhetoric on the international stage.

"Oman is one of the few Arab countries with which Iran has had consistent and regular good relations," Kamrava said. "Whether the Sultan of Oman is bearing a message or not is something we won't know until somewhat later, but certainly countries like Oman could play a very important intermediary role between Iran and the United States."

During his three-day visit, Qaboos will meet Rouhani, clerical Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and powerful Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani, local media said. Iranian and Omani officials will also discuss cooperation on energy issues.

headline: Colombia peace talks with FARC rebels to resume
byline: By Peter Murphy
6:20pm EDT

Colombia's government and FARC rebels will resume peace talks on Monday, the chief government negotiator said, a day after both sides cast doubt on the process by suspending negotiations.

President Juan Manuel Santos will send his team back to talks hosted by Cuba after verifying that the FARC was prepared to head back to the negotiating table, former Vice President Humberto de la Calle said on Saturday.

"The president has instructed us on the decision to return tomorrow to Havana to continue talks on a search for an end to the conflict," de la Calle said, reading a prepared statement.

"It was carefully noted that the FARC had taken the decision to return on Monday at half past eight in the morning to the talks table to continue deliberations as normal."

Santos' decision on Friday to recall his team in Havana came after the FARC declared a pause in talks to study a government proposal on how to ratify a final peace accord. The suspension was a setback after nine months of difficult discussions.

While the walkout was short-lived, such interruptions may become more common as talks progress through the tough five-point agenda. Under discussion now is the FARC's incorporation into the political system, one of the thorniest issues. Santos has said he wants talks concluded by the end of the year.

Both sides have much at stake. Santos has bet his political legacy on bringing peace to the Andean nation, while a military victory for the FARC rebels now looks less likely after a 10-year U.S.-backed military offensive that slashed their numbers to about 8,000 from 17,000.

Colombians are desperate to see an end to the war that has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced millions since it began in 1964. Santos is also eager to begin negotiating with the National Liberation Army, a smaller rebel group known as the ELN, to cement peace.

Santos called his negotiators back to Colombia on Friday after the FARC said hours earlier it would take time out to study the government´s draft bill that would require any peace deal with the guerrillas to be put to a popular vote.

The FARC, considered a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union, has insisted a constituent assembly be formed and be charged with incorporating the content of the peace deals into the country´s constitution. The government has rejected that demand.

The two sides had determined in an initial agreement that led to the start of peace talks that they would decide together how to ratify an eventual peace deal.

Santos, who is widely expected to run for a second presidential term next year, said on Friday he accepted the FARC's right to study the referendum proposal for a short time, but later asserted the rebel leadership would not dictate any stoppages in the talks.

The government is still combating the nearly five-decade old guerrilla movement militarily, having refused to declare a ceasefire.

Thirteen soldiers were ambushed and killed by the FARC on Saturday in the oil-producing province of Arauca, the army said. In July, rebels killed 19 soldiers in two separate attacks. Most of them were protecting an oil pipeline in the country´s northeast.



headline: Japan's Abe battles doctors' lobby over 'Third Arrow' reform
byline: By Linda Sieg
6:20pm EDT

but the country's doctors' lobby is opposing what they say is risky surgery.

Health care has become the latest battleground in Abe's efforts to craft a strategy to engineer growth in the world's third biggest economy, the so-called "Third Arrow" of his economic turnaround plan.

The plans include changes to the country's universal health insurance system - as cherished in Japan as the National Health Service is in Britain - in order to boost growth by increasing demand for innovative drugs and medical devices.

The debate is being cast as a litmus test of Abe's commitment to deregulation as he attempts to revitalize Japan's stagnant economy. It also illustrates the opposition that Abe, who returned to power after his Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) big election win in December, faces from within his own camp.

"The idea of the growth strategy is ... for the private and public sectors to get together and promote innovation, We agree with that," Takashi Hanyuda, an LDP lawmaker who is also vice president of a powerful doctors' lobby, told Reuters.

The growth strategy also aims to promote exports of advanced medical technology and speed approval of new drugs and devices.

"But we have to protect the universal health insurance system to which everyone belongs," said the 65-year-old ophthalmologist, elected to parliament last month after running with the support of the Japan Medical Association (JMA).

"If the system starts to break down a little, it will turn into a flood and it would be extremely hard to halt the trend."

On one side of the argument is the 165,000-member JMA and health ministry officials, who say they want to protect the cherished principle of universality in a system that has been the envy of much of the developed world.

Lined up against them, and pushing Abe to go further, are advocates of more radical reform who accuse the small family doctors who make up the bulk of the JMA's membership of wanting protection from competition from larger clinics and hospitals.

Reformers say the changes would give patients more choice and allow doctors more discretion.

The JMA, the health ministry and some experts counter that the reforms would widen healthcare gaps between rich and poor. Critics also question just how much economic growth the changes proposed in a growth strategy unveiled in June would generate.

The JMA also worries that Abe's push for Tokyo to join the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade pact would give impetus to such changes if Washington pushes in negotiations for market-oriented reforms to healthcare, although U.S. officials deny they have such an agenda in mind.

RETURN OF THE "TRIBES"

Organized interest groups and the "zoku giin" ("tribal lawmakers") who represent them have staged a comeback since the LDP returned to power in December after a three-years gap and cemented its grip on government in a July upper house poll.

So although opposition parties have been badly weakened, Abe faces tough policy battles with forces inside his own party.

"The organized vote is definitely making its presence known. The 'zoku giin' are feeling empowered," said Steven Reed, a political science professor at Chuo University in Tokyo.

At first blush, the proposed reform hardly appears the stuff of a political battle royal.

All Japanese are enrolled in one of four health insurance schemes that provide the same level of cover at the same prices.

But because of a ban unique to Japan, patients who want to combine a new drug or treatment not included in the official health insurance package with a treatment that is ordinarily covered must pay out of their own pocket for both.

That means they are faced with an "all-or-nothing" choice - relatively low-cost treatment inside the public insurance scheme or relatively high-cost treatment without any public cover.

That ban on so-called "mixed medical treatment" was imposed because the system, whose roots stretch back before World War Two, is based on the premise of ensuring equal access for all Japanese to the full range of safe and effective treatments.

Exceptions have been made for some advanced treatments - such as cancer drugs approved overseas but not yet in Japan - on the assumption that effective drugs and devices will eventually be covered by public insurance.

Critics say the system is too slow and exceptions too few.

"HOLY GRAIL" OF HEALTHCARE

Abe returned to power for a rare second term pledging to revive Japan with a radical economic policy - known as "Abenomics" - comprising the "Three Arrows" of drastic monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and a growth strategy that includes structural reforms such as deregulation.

Unveiling his "Third Arrow" in June, Abe promised to "dramatically" expand mixed care in health by increasing the range of treatments included and reducing approval times. On Thursday he reiterated that the change should be a top priority.

Advocates of more radical change want a complete end to the ban.

"The current system is unfair," said Haruo Shimada, president of the Chiba University of Commerce and a former an adviser to then-premier Junichiro Koizumi, a privatization fan, during his 2001-2006 term. "It's an institutional defect."

Some even want to deregulate public health insurance and widen the scope for private providers, reducing the burden on public finances already heavily strained by Japan's ageing population and spurring growth of innovative medical treatments.

"The government should abandon 100 percent control over the medical industry, especially insurance," Shimada said. "Liberalization of the differential in terms of quality and price would give tremendous growth power for the medical industry."

Doctors at large hospitals that would benefit most from the change also favor a complete end to the ban, pitting them against self-employed physicians operating small clinics.

"The JMA says they are protecting patients' interests, but in fact, it is the patients who are crying," said former surgeon Ryosuke Tsuchiya, a member of the board at the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research and an expert adviser to Abe's panel on regulatory reform, who wants the ban lifted entirely.

Critics say the doctors' group is trying to protect the interests of its members who won't be able to compete against bigger hospitals offering advanced care in a deregulated system, while health ministry officials want to maintain their control.

"They are protecting their turf, power and influence," Shimada said.

Health ministry officials counter that leaving healthcare to market forces threatens both quality and equal access.

Some outside experts agree that lifting the ban, or even easing it, would be a move towards creating a two-tiered medical insurance system in which expensive, advanced treatments would increasingly be left outside universal coverage.

"Universality of access is the â&euro;&tilde;holy grail' of healthcare in Japan and they (the JMA and health ministry) don't want to see anything that would fundamentally undermine that commitment to universal access," said one foreign medical industry expert.

Given the tangle of conflicting interests, the outlook for drastic reform is dim. The prime minister already faces a politically fraught decision on whether to implement a planned sales tax rise next year and is pushing controversial changes to Japan's security policies, so may have little political capital to spend on deregulation, those involved in the process said.

Still, with no election set until 2016, the next three years may offer the best chance to push deregulation.

"If we want to promote growth, we need to deregulate where possible since the scope for fiscal measures is limited," said Yuri Okina, a Japan Research Institute economist and member of Abe's regulatory reform panel."For deregulation, now is our only chance."



headline: Brotherhood leaders to go on trial in Egypt
byline: By Alistair Lyon
3:59pm EDT

Three leaders of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood go on trial in Cairo on Sunday on charges of inciting lethal violence during unrest that preceded the army's overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi.

Mohamed Badie, the Islamist movement's "General Guide", and his two deputies, Khairat al-Shater and Rashad Bayoumy, will not attend the High Court session, the state news agency MENA said.

The trial signals the determination of Egypt's new army-backed rulers to crush an organization they have portrayed as a violent, terrorist group bent on undermining the state.

The Brotherhood, which won five successive votes after the fall of former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, says it is a peaceful movement unjustly targeted by the generals who ousted Mursi, Egypt's first freely elected leader, on July 3.

The military contends it was responding to the people's will, citing vast demonstrations at the time against the rule of a man criticized for accumulating excessive power, pushing a partisan Islamist agenda and mismanaging the economy.

Mursi has been in detention in an undisclosed location since army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi deposed him.

Charges against Badie and his aides include incitement to violence and relate to an anti-Brotherhood protest outside the group's Cairo headquarters on July 30 in which nine people were killed and 91 wounded. The 70-year-old Brotherhood leader was detained last week. Shater and Bayoumy were picked up earlier.

The trial opens only three days after Mubarak, who was arrested in April, 2011, left prison following a court order to release him. He faces a retrial on charges of complicity in the killing of protesters during the revolt against him, but judges have ruled there are no legal grounds to keep him behind bars.

The army-installed government has used its powers under a month-long state of emergency to keep Mubarak, 85, under house arrest, apparently to minimize the risk of popular anger if he had simply walked free. He is now in an upscale military hospital in a Cairo suburb.

More than 1,000 people, including about 100 soldiers and police, have died in violence across Egypt since Mursi's overthrow, making it the bloodiest civil unrest in the republic's 60-year history. Brotherhood supporters say the toll is much higher.

Pro-Mursi crowds staged scattered marches on what they had billed as a "Friday of Martyrs", but the Brotherhood's ability to mobilize huge crowds appears to have been enfeebled by the round-up of its leaders and the bloody dispersal of protest camps set up in Cairo to demand the president's reinstatement.

Mursi's return is not on the cards for now. The army has announced a roadmap for a return to democracy which involves overhauling the constitution adopted under Mursi last year, with parliamentary and presidential elections to follow.

Changes proposed by a government-appointed legal panel would scrap last year's Islamic additions to the constitution and revive a Mubarak-era voting system. Islamists and liberals have expressed alarm about the suggestions.

Khaled Dawoud, a member of the liberal Dostour party, said he was worried by plans to retain articles under which journalists risk jail for "insulting the president" and newspapers can be closed for violating media laws - penalties enforced under Mursi, as well as during Mubarak's 30-year rule.

"I want new freedoms, more freedoms and not to end up with something similar to the 1971 constitution or one worse than Mursi's 2012 constitution," he said.

Islamists are also up in arms, for different reasons, saying the changes amount to an assault on Egypt's "Islamic identity".

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the roadmap and the constitutional process in a call with interim Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy on Friday, MENA reported.

The United States has voiced concern about bloodshed in Egypt since Mursi's fall. President Barack Obama has stopped short of cutting the $1.5 billion in mostly military U.S. aid to Cairo, but has ruled out any "return to normal business".



headline: Australia's opposition leader pledges stronger economy if elected PM
byline: By James Grubel
6:20pm EDT

Australia's conservative opposition leader Tony Abbott, favorite to win September 7 elections, launched his campaign on Sunday promising to build a stronger economy, putting bulldozers on the ground and cranes in the skies.

Polls show Abbott is poised to end six years of Labor rule and sweep into office on a pro-business platform of restoring government finances and boosting investor confidence to help Australia adjust to an end of a prolonged mining boom.

"We need a new way but to get a new way we have to choose a new government," Abbott told thousands of supporters in Brisbane in the northern state of Queensland, a key poll battleground.

"We'll build a stronger economy so everyone can get ahead...I hope to be an infrastructure prime minister who puts bulldozers on the ground and cranes into our skies," he said.

Abbott described the Labor government, which has run up record debt and budget deficits and which dumped Julia Gillard as prime minister in favor of Kevin Rudd just weeks before the election, as the "worst government in our history".

He promised an Abbott government would revive business confidence, control government spending and bring about a faster return to surplus budgets, with surpluses to average around 1 percent of GDP within a decade.

"From day one, it will be obvious that Australia is under new management and once more open for business," said Abbott.

"By the end of a coalition government's first term, the budget will be on-track to a believable surplus."

Abbott, 55, a socially conservative Catholic who once trained to become a priest, has a tough image as a super-fit and combative politician and has relentlessly attacked Labor for running up record debt.

"But the worst deficit is not the budget deficit but the trust deficit. This election is all about trust," he said.

In a bid to soften his tough-guy image two of his daughters introduced Abbott at his campaign launch on Sunday, describing him as an ordinary dad.

Opinion polls show voters are slowly warming to Abbott's style. Abbott has slashed Rudd's commanding 14-point lead as preferred prime minister in July to just three points.

Abbott also promoted the stability and unity of his team, in contrast to the leadership instability under Labor, which dumped Rudd in 2010 but then brought him back in June, prompting one third of Labor's cabinet to quit.

"So my question is this: if the people who've worked with Mr Rudd don't trust him, why should you," Abbott asked voters.

HOWARD LEGACY

Abbott also promised to repeat the economic management of his mentor, former prime minister John Howard, who cut debt and delivered surplus budgets during his 11 and half years in office until late 2007. Howard was given a prolonged ovation when he took his seat at the front of the campaign launch.

With both the Labor government and Abbott's opposition promising to control spending, both parties have run low-key election campaigns with few big promises, opting instead for negative attacks on each other.

Abbott, elected Liberal Party leader in late 2009, has promised to scrap an unpopular carbon tax, which he blames for higher household bills and electricity prices, and to abolish a 30 percent profits tax on iron ore and coal mines.

His centerpiece policy is a plan for a generous parental leave scheme, where the government will pay new mothers up to six months of their salary, capped at up to A$75,000, if they take time off to look after a new born.

A lawyer and Rhodes scholar, Abbott cut his teeth in politics as a political adviser before he entered parliament in 1994. He served as workplace minister and health minister under Howard, who has been one of his strongest long-term supporters.

Abbott said he would work to recognize Australia's disadvantaged Aborigines in the country's constitution and promised to continue visiting indigenous communities.

"As long as I am in public life, I will continue to spend a week a year in a remote indigenous community as I've done over the past decade. Because, if they're good enough for people to live in, they should be good enough for a prime minister to stay in," he said.



headline: U.S. says ready to carry out military options, if Obama chooses
byline: By Phil Stewart
6:20pm EDT

The Pentagon is prepared to carry out military options on Syria should President Barack Obama order them, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Sunday.

Hagel echoed White House statements cautioning that America was still gathering the facts about the Syrian government's alleged use of poison gas against civilians.

But he noted that the U.S. military, which is repositioning its naval forces in the Mediterranean to give Obama the option for an armed strike, was ready to act if asked.

"President Obama has asked the Defense Department to prepare options for all contingencies. We have done that and we are prepared to exercise whatever option - if he decides to employ one of those options," Hagel told reporters at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur.

American and European security sources have said U.S. and allied intelligence agencies made a preliminary assessment that chemical weapons were used by Syrian forces in the attack. The United Nations has requested access to the site.

Hagel, whose week-long trip to Asia is being overshadowed by Syria tensions, participated remotely in a meeting on Saturday that Obama held with his top military and national security advisers to hash out options on Syria.

Asked whether, after that meeting, he was personally convinced chemical weapons had been used in Syria, Hagel said: "We, along with our allies, are continuing to assess the intelligence, and the specifics of that intelligence, on the use chemical weapons."

"I wouldn't go any further than that until we have more intelligence, based on facts," he said.

Obama has been reluctant to intervene in Syria's civil war, but reports of the killings near Damascus have put pressure on the White House to make good on the president's comment a year ago that chemical weapons would be a "red line" for the United States.

Hagel did not enter into detail about what options the United States was weighing, but noted that any scenario carried risks. He noted on his flight to Malaysia that if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces intentionally used chemical weapons, "there may be another attack coming".

"There are risks and consequences for any option that would be used -- or not used. For action or inaction," Hagel said on Sunday.

"All of those assessments are being made. They will be driven by â&euro;Ś the facts, what our intelligence assessment produces, law, legal issues, international support."



headline: China's Bo denounces former police chief as vile liar
byline: By John Ruwitch
6:20pm EDT

Ousted senior Chinese politician Bo Xilai angrily denounced his former police chief on Sunday on the fourth day of his trial, calling him a "vile character" who faked testimony implicating Bo in covering up a murder committed by his wife.

Bo was a rising star in China's leadership circles when his career was stopped short last year by a murder scandal which saw his wife Gu Kailai convicted of poisoning a British businessman.

Bo is now on trial charged with corruption, taking bribes and abuse of power, the last of which is especially sensitive as it involves allegations Bo challenged the authority of the ruling Communist Party.

Despite Bo's feisty defense, a guilty verdict is a foregone conclusion as China's courts are controlled by the Communist Party. State media, which speaks for the party, has already all but condemned him.

Since the trial began on Thursday in eastern Jinan city, Bo has repeatedly said he is not guilty of any wrongdoing and has called his wife's testimony against him the ravings of a mad woman. The trial will be adjourned on Sunday at midday until Monday morning, the court said.

On Sunday, Bo rebutted earlier testimony from his former police chief, Wang Lijun, who carried out Bo's crackdown on crime and gangs in Chongqing, where Bo was Communist Party chief.

Wang said he had told Bo that his wife, Gu, once a glamorous lawyer, had murdered British businessman Neil Heywood, who had been a family friend.

"During Wang Lijun's testimony he is continuing to lie obviously, and what he is saying is totally unreliable, it is full of deception, he's just mouthing off," Bo told the court, according to the court's official microblog.

"He has a vile character, spreading rumors here and muddying the waters."

RARE GLIMPSE OF LIVES OF RICH

Wang said when he told Bo that Gu had poisoned Heywood, Bo was furious and punched him on his left ear, leaving him "bleeding from the mouth", according to Wang's testimony on Saturday. Wang said Bo did not accept Gu's involvement in the murder and had illegally sacked him.

"He said it was not a slap but a punch, but I've never learned how to box and have no great strength to strike out," Bo said.

Wang fled to the U.S. consulate in the nearby city of Chengdu in February last year after confronting Bo with evidence about Gu, according to official accounts.

After first helping Gu evade suspicion of poisoning Heywood, Wang hushed up evidence of the murder, according to the official account of Wang's trial. Wang has also been convicted and jailed over Heywood's murder.

On Saturday, Bo admitted to shaming his country and poorly handling a defection attempt by Wang, but Bo denied trying to protect his wife from Wang's murder accusation.

Many in China have been fascinated by the trial and the unusual decision to carry at least part of the proceedings on the court's official microblog, though what is coming out is likely highly edited.

The testimony has also offered a salacious glimpse into the glitzy lifestyles of China's elite politicians, complete with private jets and expensive foreign holidays, reinforcing a campaign by President Xi Jinping against corruption and opulence.

Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, in a front page editorial on Sunday, warned officials that the "worship of gold and material possessions" was the road to ruin.

"This causes people to go bad politically, be economically avaricious, morally degenerate and depraved," it said.

6:20pm EDT

A divide within Hungary's leftist opposition has deepened after leaders of its two biggest parties clashed over who would challenge Prime Minister Viktor Orban in next year's election.

Orban's conservative party Fidesz is leading in opinion polls but about half of Hungarian voters are undecided and the economy is barely growing after a recession last year.

Late on Friday, talks between the Socialist Party and former Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai's breakaway leftist party Egyutt 2014 stalled after their leaders proposed different methods for choosing a joint leftist candidate for the premiership.

Senior Egyutt 2014 figure Viktor Szigetvari said on Saturday he expected the negotiations with the Socialists to continue.

up of talks ... and there is no intention of that on our side," Szigetvari wrote in a reply to questions from Reuters.

Attila Mesterhazy, chairman of the Socialist Party which evolved from the communists who ruled Hungary from 1956 to 1989, is competing for the leadership against Bajnai, who from 2009 to 2010 was part of a government that introduced painful spending cuts to put the economy back on a sustainable path.

On Friday, in an attempt to resolve the deadlock, Bajnai proposed the two men conduct brief campaigns followed by a televised debate. Hungary's main polling institutes would then ask voters who was the better candidate.

He said the Socialists should present candidates in 71 of Hungary's 106 parliamentary constituencies and his own party would field 35.

Mesterhazy called Bajnai's proposal an unexpected ultimatum and responded with a proposal for the two parties to hold primaries in all the constituencies and to decide who would stand for the premiership.

Szigetvari said any other method than an opinion poll would be too expensive, time-consuming and potentially damaging to the opposition, but they would study the Socialist proposal.

The tension has dimmed prospects for a strong alliance that can unseat Orban, said Peter Kreko, political analyst at think tank Political Capital.

"Anti-government voters can consider this opposition totally incompetent. How can these people govern the country if they are unable to make any compromise on the nomination?", he said.

byline: By Matthias Williams
6:20pm EDT

rape of a journalist in Mumbai, an official said on Saturday, in a case that has drawn comparisons with an attack in December that led to nationwide protests and a revision of rape laws.

News of Thursday's attack sparked street protests and uproar in parliament and put the spotlight back on women's safety in India, where memories of the rape and murder of a student in New Delhi last December are still fresh.

Many Indians have questioned whether, despite a toughening of rape laws after last year's attack, India is any safer. The latest assault was in the financial capital Mumbai, which is generally considered India's safest city for women.

The 22-year-old victim, a photo journalist, was admitted to hospital where she is in a stable condition. Police have released sketches of the suspects and say they will ask the government to have the case conducted in a fast-track court.

One man was arrested on Friday in connection with the attack, and Mumbai Police Commissioner Satyapal Singh told reporters a second suspect had been arrested.

"He has admitted that he has done wrong," Singh said, adding that the other suspects may have fled to the city's suburbs.

Police arrested a third suspect later on Saturday, Singh told Reuters via a phone text message, but did not elaborate.

BROKEN BEER BOTTLE

The attack took place shortly before sunset in a former industrial district that is now one of the city's fastest-growing neighborhoods. The woman was at an abandoned textile mill on assignment with a male colleague.

They were separated by the attackers and the woman's colleague was tied up with a belt while she was assaulted.

"In the 21st-century, I am ashamed that a journalist doing her job has to go through something like this," said Bharatkumar Raut, a Mumbai-born lawmaker in the upper house of parliament.

is becoming insecure," he told Reuters by phone.

Indian TV news channels and newspapers, citing police sources and statements purportedly made by the victim, have disclosed some details of the assault.

According to the Mumbai daily Mid Day, the attackers threatened to slash the victim with a broken beer bottle. They also threatened to reveal her identity if she reported the incident, it reported.

The Times of India on Saturday quoted a statement by the victim from her hospital bed.

"I want no other woman in this city and country to go through such brutal physical humiliation," she was quoted as saying. "The perpetrators should be punished severely as they have ruined my life."

Reuters was unable to independently verify the statements. Himanshu Roy, Mumbai's joint commissioner of police, declined to comment when contacted by telephone.

The trials of the four men and one juvenile accused of the December attack are expected to conclude within three weeks. Closing arguments in the trial of the four adult suspects started on Thursday.

Following a public outcry over the Delhi attack, India introduced tougher rape laws in March, which include the death penalty for repeat offenders and for those whose victims were left in a "vegetative state".



headline: Obama weighs possible military response after Syria chemical attack
byline: By Oliver Holmes and Roberta Rampton
6:20pm EDT

U.S. President Barack Obama considered options on Saturday for a possible military strike on Syria in response to a nerve gas attack that killed hundreds as Syria sought to avert blame by saying its soldiers had found chemical weapons in rebel tunnels.

A senior U.N. official arrived in Damascus to seek access for inspectors to the site of last Wednesday's attack, in which opposition accounts say between 500 and well over 1,000 civilians were killed by gas fired by pro-government forces.

In the most authoritative account so far, the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said three hospitals near Damascus had reported 355 deaths in the space of three hours out of about 3,600 admissions with nerve gas-type symptoms.

The accounts and video footage of the victims - men, women and children - have heightened Western calls for a robust, U.S.-led response after 2-1/2 years of international inaction on a conflict that has killed 100,000 people.

U.S. military and national security advisers met Obama at the White House on Saturday to consider options for a response, the day after Washington said it was realigning forces in the Mediterranean to give him the option of attacking Syria.

Obama, long hesitant to intervene, said in a CNN interview broadcast on Friday that the United States was still gathering information about the attack.

He noted, however, that chemicals weapon use on a large scale would start "getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region".

In a development that could raise pressure on him to act, American and European security sources said U.S. and allied intelligence agencies had made a preliminary assessment that chemical weapons had been used by pro-Assad forces this week.

MILITARY OPTIONS

Among the military options under consideration are missile strikes on Syrian units believed to be responsible for chemical attacks or on Assad's air force and ballistic missile sites, U.S. officials said. Such strikes could be launched from U.S. ships or from combat aircraft capable of firing missiles from outside Syrian airspace, thereby avoiding Syrian air defenses.

Major world powers - including Russia, Assad's main ally which has long blocked U.N.-sponsored intervention against him - have urged the Syrian leader to cooperate with U.N. chemical weapons inspectors already in Damascus to pursue earlier allegations.

Syria accuses rebels of staging the attack to provoke intervention. State television said soldiers had found chemical weapons on Saturday in tunnels that had been used by rebels.

A presenter said five blue and green plastic storage drums shown in video footage, along with rusty mortar bombs, grenades, domestic gas canisters and vials labeled "atropine", a nerve gas antidote, were proof that rebels had used chemical weapons.

Separately, the state news agency SANA said soldiers had "suffered from cases of suffocation" when rebels used poison gas "as a last resort" after government forces made "big gains" against them in the Damascus suburb of Jobar.

It said clashes were still raging in the area but that the army had advanced and found "chemical agents" in rebel tunnels.

The leader of the opposition Syrian National Coalition, Ahmad al-Jarba, and the head of the rebel Free Syrian Army, General Salim Idriss, denied on Saturday that rebels had used chemical weapons.

At a press conference in Istanbul, Idriss said the rebels would respond, but not with "similar crimes".

Jabra said the "most important cause" of the attack was the silence and inaction of the international community, especially the West.

A scheduled August 25-27 conference of military chiefs of the United States, Jordan, its main Western allies and Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, intended to help contain the fallout of a war spilling beyond Syria's borders, has been given added urgency by the gas attack.

WAITING FOR OBAMA

"We had been expecting to talk mainly about stabilizing Jordan," said a European defense source. "Instead, it will be dominated by Syria. It's all really waiting on the Americans and what they decide they want to do ...

"There have been discussions, but so far they have been very inconclusive. As the scale of what happened in Damascus becomes clear, that may change."

U.N. High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Angela Kane arrived in Damascus to press for access to the scene.

"The solution is obvious. There is a United Nations team on the ground, just a few kilometers away. It must very quickly be allowed to go to the site to carry out the necessary tests without hindrance," French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said during a visit to the Palestinian territories.

German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said Berlin expected Russia to "raise the pressure on Damascus so that the inspectors can independently investigate".

While some of the United States' NATO allies, including France, Britain and Turkey, have explicitly blamed Assad's forces for the chemical attack, Russia said the rebels were impeding an inquiry and that Assad would have no interest in using poison gas for fear of foreign intervention.

"Assad does not look suicidal," senior pro-Kremlin lawmaker Igor Morozov told Interfax news agency. "He well understands that in this case, allies would turn away from him and ... opponents would rise. All moral constraints would be discarded regarding outside interference."

Alexei Pushkov, pro-Kremlin chairman of the international affairs committee in Russia's lower house of parliament, said: "In London they are 'convinced' that Assad used chemical weapons, and earlier they were 'convinced' that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. It's the same old story."

Russia said last month that its analysis indicated a projectile that hit the city of Aleppo on March 19 contained the nerve agent sarin and was most likely fired by rebels.

President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, Assad's most powerful Middle Eastern ally, acknowledged for the first time on Saturday that chemical weapons had killed people in Syria and called for the international community to prevent their use.

headline: China's Bo admits 'shame', denies protecting wife
byline: By John Ruwitch
6:20pm EDT

Ousted senior Chinese politician Bo Xilai admitted to shaming his country and poorly handling a defection attempt by his former police chief after he told Bo his wife had committed murder, but Bo denied trying to protect her from the accusation.

Bo was a rising star in China's leadership circles when his career was stopped short last year by the scandal involving his wife, Gu Kailai. Bo is now on trial charged with corruption, taking bribes and abuse of power.

Supporters of Bo's Maoist-themed social programs say he lost out in a power struggle with capitalist-leaning reformists in Beijing, exposing divisions within the ruling Communist Party as well as society.

With the evidence relating to the first two charges against Bo now apparently out of the way, the most sensitive charge was heard on Saturday, the third day of a trial many expected would last just a day.

A guilty verdict for Bo is a foregone conclusion, and despite his spirited defense, published on the court's official microblog, state media, which speaks for the party, has already all but condemned him.

As police chief of Chongqing, where Bo was Communist Party chief until he was dramatically sacked early last year, Wang Lijun was known as the strong arm of the law, energetically carrying out Bo's crackdown on crime and gangs.

But he fled to the U.S. consulate in the nearby city of Chengdu in February last year after confronting Bo with evidence that his wife Gu, a glamorous lawyer, was involved in the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.

After first helping Gu evade suspicion of poisoning Heywood, Wang hushed up evidence of the murder, according to the official account of Wang's trial. Both Wang and Gu have been jailed for the murder.

When Wang told Bo of his suspicions about Gu, he was "angrily rebuked and had his ears boxed", according to the official account of the incident related by state media.

Bo told the court that he felt "ashamed" by Wang's flight to the U.S. mission which had reflected badly on the image of the party and country.

"I wasn't able to behave coolly at a critical juncture and I made serious errors in judgment," Bo said, according to a transcript provided by the court. "So I bear some responsibility for Wang Lijun's flight and I feel very sorry for this."

"I have made mistakes and errors, I feel very sorry and I'm willing to take appropriate responsibility, but whether there was a crime or not is another matter," Bo said.

"I did not act illegally to show favoritism and protect Gu Kailai."

Bo said he did not believe it when Wang first told him Gu was a suspect in Heywood's murder, saying Gu had shown Bo a Chongqing police report that said Heywood died of a heart attack bought on by drinking, which Heywood's wife had signed.

"In my mind, Gu Kailai is a weak and frail woman, she could not kill someone. And she had a good relationship with Wang Lijun," Bo said.

Bo was furious with Wang when he was told that his wife was a murder suspect, and sacked him despite not having party authority to do so, sources with knowledge of the case have said. Neither did Bo report the matter to his bosses in Beijing, all of which led to the abuse of power charge, they said.

Bo ordered his mayor, Huang Qifan, and security personnel to besiege the U.S. mission in Chengdu and take Wang into custody, even though he had no authority to mobilize security forces to grab someone in another city, the sources also said.

Wang was eventually coaxed out by officials from Beijing and taken to the capital. The Chongqing government initially explained he was worn out and emotionally spent and had taken a "vacation-style treatment".

"LACKED ALERTNESS"

Bo denied sacking Wang because of the murder allegations against Gu, saying he had reassigned Wang for genuine health reasons as Wang had complained of the pressure of his job.

Wang himself appeared in court to testify against Bo, saying he believed Bo sacked him to cover up the murder, adding that Bo had punched him during a confrontation over Gu's role in the crime.

"It was very dangerous at that time," Wang said, when asked why he had fled to the U.S. consulate. "I was the victim of violence, and my colleagues and those handling the case had disappeared."

The court said the trial would continue on Sunday.

Earlier in the day, Bo accepted responsibility for 5 million yuan ($817,000) in government funds he is accused of embezzling which ended up in his wife's bank account, saying he had let his attention wander, in testimony read out in court.

Bo said that Wang Zhenggang, former director of the urban and rural planning bureau in Dalian, where Bo once served as mayor, told him in 2002 that he suggested to Bo the money be used by Bo's wife and son, who was studying overseas.

"I refused him. Afterwards, Wang Zhenggang came and found me again, told me why the money was difficult to deal with, and said that if I were busy he could talk to Gu Kailai about it," Bo said, according to his testimony.

Bo said he agreed to Wang speaking to Gu about the money because he "lacked alertness", which is how the money ended up going to her. "After Gu and Wang had their discussions, I did not go and investigate, I let it slide," Bo said.

"This money had already gone into my wife's account, leading to the personal use of public money," he said.

"I am willing to approve the analysis of the prosecutors after their investigation, and at the same time accept legal responsibility for this. I am deeply ashamed and regretful about this incident," Bo said.

During court proceedings, Bo disputed Wang's account of what had happened to the money as containing inconsistencies, but Bo did not dispute his earlier written deposition, according to court transcripts.

"From start to finish in this written deposition I hold that I had did not intend to embezzle this money," he said.

On the first day of the trial, Bo mounted a feisty defense of charges he received more than 20 million yuan in bribes.

Bo said that he had initially admitted to anti-corruption investigators receiving the bribes as he had been "under psychological pressure".

Bo also said he been framed by one of the men accused of bribing him, businessman Tang Xiaolin, who he called a "mad dog".

headline: Constitutional tweaks may empower Mubarak-era politicians in Egypt

7:26pm EDT

backed rulers would scrap Islamic additions to a constitution forced through under deposed President Mohamed Mursi and revive a voting system dating back to his predecessor Hosni Mubarak.

Islamists and liberals have voiced alarm about the proposals made by a constitutional committee set up by the generals who removed the Muslim Brotherhood's Mursi on July 3 amid widespread protests against Egypt's first freely elected leader.

The army has suspended the constitution adopted under Mursi late last year. It had been endorsed by a referendum after he grabbed extraordinary powers to ensure its passage, igniting some of the bloodiest street protests of his turbulent year in power.

Now an army-installed government is revising a document faulted for embedding Islamic influence in lawmaking and for short-changing human rights, especially of women and minorities, including Christians who form some 10 percent of the population.

The changes drafted by a 10-member committee - and leaked to the media on Wednesday, the same day a court ordered Mubarak freed from jail - are part of an army roadmap back to democracy.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the roadmap and the constitutional process in a call with interim Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy on Friday, state news agency MENA reported.

The United States has voiced concern about the army's bloody crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and other violence in which more than 1,000 people, about a tenth of them soldiers and police, have been killed since Mursi fell.

President Barack Obama has stopped short of cutting the $1.5 billion that Washington provides each year in mostly military aid to Egypt, but has ruled out any "return to normal business".

The constitutional amendments drafted by the committee are due to go to a diverse 50-strong assembly to be appointed by the interim government, but they are already proving contentious.

Curiously, given that popular protests helped sweep away Egypt's last two leaders, one new article would outlaw this and would give parliament the sole right to dismiss a president.

"What is the point of having an article like that?" asked rights activist Gamal Eid. "The whole world will laugh at us."

RETURN TO OLD VOTING SYSTEM

The committee is likely to propose retaining an article that exempts Egypt's powerful military from financial or political auditing, insiders on the body said. Mursi, anxious not to alienate the defense establishment, had also left this alone.

One of the most significant suggested changes would return Egypt to voting for individual candidates, rather than reserving some seats for party lists, in parliamentary elections.

Under the current system, in which two-thirds of seats go to party lists and one-third to individuals, the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist parties won about 80 percent of seats in the first parliamentary election after Mubarak's overthrow in 2011.

"This change seems to target Islamists and it will be wrong and undemocratic," Eid said. "We had complaints ... about the Brotherhood and Islamists, but that does not mean ruling them out of politics as this will only lead to more violence."

Khaled Dawoud, a member of the liberal Dostour party, described the proposal as a return to the Mubarak era, when votes were routinely rigged to enable the president's National Democratic Party (NDP) to maintain its dominance of parliament.

The system allowed individuals, mostly aligned with the NDP, to run as "independents" using local patronage networks to get into parliament. Brotherhood candidates also ran candidates as independents to keep a limited presence in the assembly.

Once Mubarak was gone, the Islamist movement emerged from the shadows and used its organizational muscle to win five successive victories at the polls, gaining seats in parliament both for those on party lists and those running as individuals.

Dawoud said he was worried by plans to retain articles under which journalists risk jail for "insulting the president" and newspapers can be closed for press crimes - penalties enforced under Mursi, as well as during Mubarak's 30-year rule.

"I want new freedoms, more freedoms and not to end up with something similar to the 1971 constitution or one worse than Mursi's 2012 constitution," he said.

Islamists are also up in arms, for different reasons, saying the changes amount to an assault on Egypt's "Islamic identity".

According to MENA, the committee has proposed scrapping articles that accorded Islam more weight in lawmaking, gave the Sunni Muslim religious authority al-Azhar a role in vetting legislation, committed the state to upholding "morals and public order" and banned insults to "prophets and religions".

To the dismay of liberals and Christians, the constitution adopted under Mursi had strengthened a provision in its 1971 predecessor that made Islamic sharia the source of legislation.

However, the provision, due to revert to its original form in the proposed changes, was only patchily applied from 1971.

"We will protest in all legal ways available against any change to the state's Islamic identity," said Ahmed Habashi, a leader in the ultra-orthodox Islamist Nour Party in the Delta town of Mahalla. If that effort failed, he said, "we will call for protests".

Before the new constitution is ratified, it must be approved by a referendum and signed by interim President Adly Mansour.

Brotherhood leaders are mostly in jail or on the run and could not be reached for comment on the proposed changes.

Younes Makhyoun, head of the Nour Party, which initially backed the army's removal of Mursi, has warned against any arbitrary campaign targeting Islamists after the crackdown on the Brotherhood, and has urged the government to protect freedoms won by the anti-Mubarak revolt.

The legal committee, which proposed cancelling 32 of the constitution's 236 articles and amending 109, suggested abolishing the toothless upper house of parliament.

According to the military's roadmap, the new constitution should be adopted in about four months, with parliamentary and presidential elections to follow.

armed neighbors.

But the push by Pakistan's civilian government to improve relations with India has been undermined by a series of clashes that began this month along their border dividing the disputed Kashmir region.

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif says better relations with India are key to restoring a flagging economy but it is Pakistan's military that traditionally sets foreign and security policies, even during periods of civilian rule.

The prisoners, including fishermen detained for straying into what Pakistan sees as its waters over the past two years, were allowed to go home through the Wagah border crossing, between the Pakistani city of Lahore and India's Amritsar.

"Pakistan and India were one country in past, they should compromise with each other and live peacefully like brothers," said fisherman Kailash Nathu, 17, who was heading home after being arrested in January.

Another Indian fisherman, 30-year-old Shabbir Usman, said India should now release Pakistani prisoners.

"Pakistan and India should sign a treaty for not arresting innocent fishermen. If they sign such treaty, it would help strengthen friendly relations," he said, surrounded by grinning colleagues as they approached the border crossing.

But an Indian foreign ministry spokesman said New Delhi would not make a reciprocal gesture.

"Release is only of those who have completed prison terms and have been identified as nationals. This is normal process and not a reciprocal one," the Indian spokesman said via a telephone text message ahead, of the release.

Before the latest clashes along the so-called Line of Control separating Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir, the two countries had agreed to resume stalled talks on improving ties.

But many analysts doubt whether the Indian government, under pressure from the right-wing opposition, can commit to any meaningful concessions before national elections next year.

Sharif is due to meet his Indian counterpart, Manmohan Singh, at the United Nations in New York next month and Saturday's prisoner release would appear to underline his determination to improve ties.

India and Pakistan have fought three wars since becoming independent from Britain in 1947, two of them over the Muslim-majority Himalayan region of Kashmir.

affirmed his commitment to signing key agreements with the European Union, including on trade, despite a threat by Russia's Vladimir Putin of possible retaliatory measures.

Russia, the ex-Soviet republic's biggest trading partner, last week signaled growing alarm at Kiev's policy of European integration by conducting laborious extra customs checks on imports from Ukraine, causing delays at the border.

Though Russia ended the customs checks after a few days, Putin last Thursday added to fears in Kiev of a possible trade war by saying that a free trade deal between Ukraine and the EU might "squeeze out" Russian goods.

He warned that members of the Eurasian Customs Union linking Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan might have to take "protective measures" to defend their markets.

In an Independence Day speech on Saturday, Yanukovich, once regarded as being more Russia-friendly than his nationalist predecessor Viktor Yushchenko, pointedly ignored Putin's comments.

While pledging to deepen relations with Russia and other customs union members, he indicated that Kiev was committed to signing agreements on political association and free trade with the EU at a summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, in November.

"For Ukraine, association with the European Union must become an important stimulus for forming a modern European state," he declared.

"At the same time, we must preserve and continue deepening our relations (and) processes of integration with Russia, countries of the Eurasian community, other world leaders and new centers of economic development," he said.

Ukraine's economy relies heavily on exports of steel, coal, fuel and petroleum products, chemicals and grain. More than 60 percent of its exports go to other former Soviet republics, with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan the most important.

Ukrainian commentators see last week's customs checks as a warning shot by Moscow providing a foretaste of what can be expected if Ukraine opts for turning towards Europe and away from its former Soviet ally.

Yanukovich, backed by powerful and wealthy business figures who see greater prosperity in European markets, has resisted entreaties by Moscow to join the Customs Union - a move which would be incompatible with a free trade agreement with the EU.

But with Kiev still hopeful of securing a lower price for deliveries of costly Russian gas for the Ukrainian economy, Yanukovich needs to maintain good relations with Moscow.

He is sending his prime minister, Mykola Azarov, there on Monday to try to calm Russia's fears over Ukraine's moves towards Europe.

In an Independence Day message of congratulations to Yanukovich, Putin on Saturday avoided any discord, expressing Russia's readiness to increase cooperation with Ukraine across the board.

It is far from a foregone conclusion that a political association agreement, including a free trade deal, will be signed in Vilnius in November even though Yanukovich wants it.

Many EU member states are disappointed at the pace of democratic reform in Ukraine since Yanukovich was elected in February 2010 and are pressing particularly for the release from jail of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his fiercest political adversary.

Tymoshenko was jailed in late 2011 for seven years for abuse of office after what the EU says was a politically-motivated trial.

rape of a journalist in Mumbai, an official said on Saturday, in a case that has drawn comparisons with an attack in December that led to nationwide protests and a revision of rape laws.

News of Thursday's attack sparked street protests and uproar in parliament and put the spotlight back on women's safety in India, where memories of the rape and murder of a student in New Delhi last December are still fresh.

Many Indians have questioned whether, despite a toughening of rape laws after last year's attack, India is any safer. The latest assault was in the financial capital Mumbai, which is generally considered India's safest city for women.

The 22-year-old victim, a photo journalist, was admitted to hospital where she is in a stable condition. Police have released sketches of three other suspects and say they will ask the government to have the case conducted in a fast-track court.

One man was arrested on Friday in connection with the attack and Mumbai Police Commissioner Satyapal Singh told reporters a second suspect had been arrested.

"He has admitted that he has done wrong," Singh said, adding that the other suspects may have fled to the city's suburbs.

The attack took place shortly before sunset in a former industrial district that is now one of the city's fastest-growing neighborhoods. The woman was at an abandoned textile mill on assignment with a male colleague.

They were separated by the attackers and the woman's colleague was tied up with a belt while she was assaulted, Singh told a Friday news conference.

headline: Critics say Putin's Olympic security decree violates rights
byline: By Steve Gutterman
7:26pm EDT

Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to tighten security in the Black Sea resort of Sochi during the 2014 Winter Olympics, imposing restrictions on freedom of movement and assembly that critics said violated human rights.

The decree creates a "prohibited zone" encompassing much of the sprawling city, barring travel into Sochi by road without special permission and banning public gatherings "not connected" with the Olympics in high security areas on land and sea.

Putin has staked his reputation on the security and success of Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era and has ordered law enforcement authorities to prevent any attacks by Islamist militants based in the nearby North Caucasus provinces.

In early July, insurgent leader Doku Umarov revoked a previous order to refrain from attacking Russian targets outside the North Caucasus and urged militants to use "maximum force" to prevent Putin staging the Games.

Published in the official newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta on Friday, the decree enters into force on January 7, a month before the opening ceremony, and expires on March 21, a month after the Olympics end.

Human rights activists said the restrictions were draconian.

Barring cars from outside Sochi restricts Russians' freedom of movement and the ban on most public gatherings violates their constitutional right to free assembly, said Pavel Chikov, a human rights lawyer and head of the legal aid group Agora.

He told Ekho Moskvy radio such restrictions required passage of a law or imposition of a state of emergency.

"Under such conditions the Olympics, which are supposed to be celebration of sport and democracy, will become the exact opposite," prominent Russian environmental activist Alexei Yablokov said in a comment posted on the Internet.

"Nature is being destroyed, people are being evicted from their homes, and now it turns out that a state of emergency is being imposed," he said.

Gay rights activist Nikolai Alexeyev said he planned to hold a gay pride march in Sochi on the opening day of the Olympics and that it could not be prohibited by presidential decree.

"Are the Olympics an emergency situation, like a war or a natural disaster?" Alexeyev was quoted as saying by the website grani.ru. "There has been no precedent in history in which peaceful demonstrations have been banned in a city where the Olympics were being held."

A law Putin signed this year banning gay "propaganda" has been criticized by Western governments and prompted calls for a boycott of the Olympics. Russia has offered assurances that the law will not affect athletes or spectators.

In the decree, Putin said its purpose was the "implementation of increased security measures" called for in a law adopted in 2007, when the Olympics were awarded to Sochi.

Kremlin officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday.

byline: By Dave Graham

Schoolteachers in Mexico City staging disruptive protests against education reform have fired a warning shot at President Enrique Pena Nieto's government as it prepares to push an ambitious economic agenda through Congress.

On Friday, thousands of teachers held up traffic bound for Mexico's main international airport a day after federal lawmakers were forced to meet in a convention center next to a race course when the demonstrators blocked access to Congress.

Teachers are fighting measures that seek to improve oversight of their profession and stamp out the abuse of privileges they enjoy. If the protests continue, they risk generating momentum that could hit other bills in Congress.

Lawmakers are already discussing central planks of Pena Nieto's plans to ramp up growth in Latin America's no. 2 economy, including a contentious proposal that aims to open up the state-run oil industry to more private investment.

Another of the president's biggest plans, a drive to increase Mexico's weak tax take by about 4 percentage points of gross domestic product, is due to be presented by September 8.

Some government and opposition lawmakers have privately voiced concern that the demonstrations could undermine the administration's resolve to pursue troublesome measures.

"This is going far beyond a simple street protest, it's a clear challenge to the institutions (of the state)," said Ruben Camarillo, a lawmaker in the opposition National Action Party, or PAN, who has been a key negotiator on energy reform.

Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, attempted to defuse tensions this week by setting aside one of the three laws at the heart of his education reform to give time to the teachers to air their grievances.

But PRI lawmakers said that third bill would be passed, and Pena Nieto addressed the protests on Friday by stressing the need to sign off on the legislation.

"Society demands of those whose vocation is to educate that they really are committed to provide (this) to children and young people," he said in a speech in the capital.

The reform would take away control of teacher assessment from the sector's trade union and seeks to end the practice of educators passing on posts to relatives, or simply selling them.

Teachers are one of the most militant groups in Mexico, and have periodically staged vigorous resistance when the government has tried to change education practices.

MORE PROTESTS IN PIPELINE

Many inhabitants of Mexico City have suffered delays and traffic chaos because of the demonstrations by the teachers, although the airport continued to operate normally on Friday. Local media reported many travelers arrived late because of the protests and missed their flights.

If the protests keep interfering with Congress, it could encourage opponents of other pending legislation to take to the streets to turn up the pressure on Pena Nieto.

For its part, the government is eager to avoid any bloodshed or violence so as not to aggravate the situation. But further demonstrations are almost certain to follow.

Next month, leftist firebrand Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, twice a runner-up for the presidency, plans to try to mobilize mass protests against the energy bill, and the fiscal reform will also be in his sights once the government unveils it.

As part of its fiscal reform, the government has been considering widening the application of the value-added tax to include food and medicine, which have avoided the charge so far.

Levying VAT on food and medicine is controversial because of the effect it would have on the poor. Government officials have stressed the need to offset any negative impact with other measures - for example, broadening social security coverage.

Some PRI lawmakers said the teachers' protests made for a trickier environment for divisive measures, and that the government might lower its sights on fiscal reform.

But other PRI officials in Congress, also speaking in private, said the government should not be put off, and must press ahead with a broadening of the VAT regime.

Colombia's government and Marxist FARC rebels suspended their participation in peace talks in Cuba on Friday, complicating nine months of painstaking negotiations aimed at ending five decades of bloodshed.

President Juan Manuel Santos called his negotiating team home from Havana hours after the FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, said it would "pause" the talks to review a government plan to put any peace deal to a popular vote.

It was the first interruption to the talks that began last November and a sudden dent to hopes the two sides would soon see the difficult talks through to the end, after recent comments from the FARC had given cause for optimism.

While the halt to talks will worry Colombians, analysts said there is little reason to suspect the two sides will not resume talks again.

Santos, who bet his political legacy on bringing peace to the Andean nation, sent a bill on Thursday to Congress that calls for a referendum on any peace accord during national elections in either March or May next year.

"The FARC has decided to pause the discussions at the table, to focus exclusively on analyzing the implications of the government's proposal," Pablo Catatumbo, one of the lead FARC negotiators, said in a statement.

Santos said discussions would only resume when the government considered it appropriate.

"We are going to assess their statement, their behavior toward the government initiative (which aims) to accelerate the solution of the conflict," Santos said in a brief statement at Bogota's military airport.

"In this process, the one who makes pauses and establishes the conditions, is not the FARC."

The FARC has said repeatedly it sees a constituent assembly as the best way to enshrine the tenets of the peace accords in the country's constitution and does not trust that a referendum would protect agreements reached in Havana.

Colombians are desperate to see an end to the war that has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced millions since it began in 1964. Santos is also eager to negotiate peace with the National Liberation Army, a smaller rebel group known as the ELN. He has said he wants the FARC peace accord by November.

LIMITED PATIENCE

In the final year of his four-year term, Santos has ruled out a constituent assembly and said the Colombian people must support any deals reached before an end to the war can be declared. Santos has not said if he will seek re-election.

He accepted the FARC's right to study the government proposal, but urged the rebel negotiators not to take too long.

"The FARC has left the negotiating table to study the proposal and it's legitimate and valid that it should, but time is passing and the patience of the Colombian people has a limit," Santos said earlier on Friday.

Some analysts say the unilateral decision by the government to seek a referendum goes against the spirit of the initial agreement that led to talks, in which it was clear both sides would decide jointly how to ratify any deal.

"This incident weakens the peace process," said Carlos Lozano, political analyst and editor of the left-leaning weekly magazine Voz. "But it is not at risk because it is just an incident and can be overcome."

The FARC has battled a dozen governments since it began as an agrarian struggle against rural inequality. Even while it has been severely weakened in the past 10 years by a heavy U.S.-backed offensive, it remains a formidable threat to the government and civilian population.

More than three dozen FARC commanders are in Havana working through a five-point agenda involving agrarian reform, reparation to victims, stemming the illegal drug trade, an end to the conflict and the FARC's inclusion in the political system.

The disruption in talks comes on the heels of several comments from the FARC in recent days that appeared to show irritation with comments from Santos, but the group also recently expressed optimism that progress had been made.

In a recent interview, Santos told Reuters the rebel leadership could face jail terms if peace were achieved. He also said FARC negotiators would need to return to Colombia's jungle and face capture or death in battle if talks collapse.



headline: Obama, national security team hash out options on Syria

7:26pm EDT

U.S. military and national security advisers presented President Barack Obama on Saturday with a range of options for responding to the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, the White House said.

Obama met with top advisers including Vice President Joe Biden, national security adviser Susan Rice, and CIA Director John Brennan to hash out responses.

Obama has been reluctant to intervene in Syria's civil war, which he has described as a "sectarian complex problem." But he said a year ago that chemical weapons would be a "red line" for the United States.

Syrian opposition accounts that between 500 and well over 1,000 civilians were killed this week by gas in munitions fired by pro-government forces, and video footage of victims' bodies, have stoked demands abroad for a robust, U.S.-led response after 2-1/2 years of international inaction on Syria's conflict.

The White House said Obama spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron about Syria on Saturday and both men expressed "grave concern" about the reports of chemical weapons use.

"In coordination with international partners and mindful of the dozens of contemporaneous witness accounts and record of the symptoms of those killed, the U.S. intelligence community continues to gather facts to ascertain what occurred," the White House said in a statement.

"The president also received a detailed review of a range of potential options he had requested be prepared for the United States and the international community to respond to the use of chemical weapons."

After completing a bus tour through New York state and Pennsylvania on Friday, the president returned to a White House that was concentrating on its latest foreign policy crisis.

Vehicles pulled up in front of the West Wing on Saturday morning, bringing officials to the meeting. Secretary of State John Kerry, who is on vacation in Massachusetts, and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, who is traveling in Asia, both participated remotely.

The White House declined to say when the meeting ended, although it appeared to have lasted about three hours. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was seen exiting the building around 12:45 p.m. (1645 GMT).

Other participants included Samantha Power, the U.S. representative to the United Nations; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey; and Deputy Attorney General James Cole.

CAUTIOUS

Administration officials were cautious in describing the content of the discussions.

"We have a range of options available, and we are going to act very deliberately so that we're making decisions consistent with our national interest as well as our assessment of what can advance our objectives in Syria," a White House official said before the meeting on Saturday.

Obama said in a CNN interview broadcast on Friday that the United States was still gathering information about the apparent chemical weapons attack that killed as many as 1,000 civilians in a Damascus suburb.

He noted, however, that chemicals weapon use on a large scale would start "getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region."

American and European security sources have said U.S. and allied intelligence agencies made a preliminary assessment that chemical weapons were used by Syrian forces in the attack.

Before the Saturday meeting, officials warned not to expect a decision until concrete intelligence assessments were made.

"Once we ascertain the facts, the president will make an informed decision about how to respond," a White House official said.

The United States is repositioning naval forces in the Mediterranean to give Obama the option for an armed strike on Syria, although officials have cautioned that Obama had made no decision on such action.

A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. Navy would expand its presence in the Mediterranean to four destroyers from three.

Hagel said on Friday that Obama had asked the Pentagon for options on Syria.

"The Defense Department has responsibility to provide the president with options for all contingencies," Hagel said en route to Asia. "And that requires positioning our forces, positioning our assets, to be able to carry out different options - whatever options the president might choose." He did not elaborate.

Syrian state television said soldiers found chemical materials on Saturday in tunnels that had been used by rebels, rejecting the blame for carrying out a nerve gas attack.

The Syrian government denies being responsible for the attack and has in the past accused rebels of using chemical weapons, an allegation that Western officials have dismissed.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani weighed in on the issue for the first time, saying chemical weapons had killed people in Syria, its ally. Although Rouhani stopped short of saying who he thought had used the weapons, Iran's Foreign Ministry said evidence pointed to rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The U.S. Central Command and the Jordanian armed forces were planning to host a meeting of regional defense chiefs from Sunday to Tuesday in Jordan. The group will discuss "the region's dynamic security environment." The meeting was scheduled in June and not called in response to the recent attacks in Syria, a Pentagon spokesman said.



headline: Mystery African meat piques appetites during China trial

flying Communist Party aristocrat.

But perhaps no tidbit has attracted as much attention as the piece of exotic meat Bo's son, Guagua, brought back from a visit to Africa in 2011.

The trip was paid for by entrepreneur Xu Ming, once close to the Bo family and now detained, accused of paying bribes to Bo.

The mystery meat was a given by Guagua to his father, according to written testimony at the trial from his wife, Gu Kailai, a transcript of which was published by the court.

Gu said she did not remember what animal it came from, only that it was from a rare species.

The story of the meat is one of a slew of revelations to come out of Bo's trial which began on Thursday. He faces charges of corruption, taking bribes and abuse of power.

The court also heard allegations that Xu hired private jets for Guagua, paid for him to stay in posh hotels and even bought the family a luxury villa in southern France.

The testimony offers a glimpse into the lifestyles of China's elite politicians, and reinforces a campaign by President Xi Jinping against corruption and opulence.

Bo's wife, Gu, was imprisoned last year after being found guilty of the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.

Their son, Guagua, is living in the United States, where he is preparing to start law studies at New York's Columbia University. He has yet to comment on the trial.

In her testimony, Gu told of a dispute between father and son over the meat.

"Guagua said it could be eaten raw, but Bo Xilai said it needed to be cooked. That made Guagua mad, and he said it was very expensive and that preparing it like that would spoil it," Gu said.

In the end, the elder Bo prevailed and they steamed the meat. The taste "wasn't bad", according to Gu. "We ate this meat for a whole month," she added.

Bo told the court he knew nothing of the Africa trip. He did not mention the meat.

Online, users of China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo puzzled over the meat. "What kind of meat can you keep for a month, and where can I get some?" one microblog user asked.

On Taobao, China's most popular online shopping site, a user posted what appeared to be a joke advertisement offering meat "the same as Guagua's, eat it for a month".

"Don't hurt father's feelings by worrying about whether to eat it raw or cooked; eat it any way you like," the advertisement read.

Hong Kong's Phoenix Television carried a guide on its mainland China microblog to what kinds of meat could last a month, including legs of Parma ham. Many people said Bo's meat was probably a cured meat from South Africa known as biltong.



headline: U.S. defense chief hints at asset positioning ahead of Syria decision
byline: By Phil Stewart
6:20pm EDT

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel strongly suggested on Friday the United States was positioning naval forces and assets in anticipation of any decision by President Barack Obama to order military action on Syria after apparent chemical weapons use.

Hagel's comments to reporters traveling with him to Malaysia came after a defense official said the Navy would expand its presence in the Mediterranean with a fourth cruise-missile armed warship because of the escalating civil war in Syria.

Hagel said Obama had asked the Defense Department for options on Syria, where an apparent poison gas attack has mounted pressure on the United States to intervene in the country's 2-1/2-year-old civil war.

"The Defense Department has responsibility to provide the president with options for all contingencies," he said. "And that requires positioning our forces, positioning our assets, to be able to carry out different options - whatever options the president might choose."

Asked whether it was fair to report that the United States had moved assets, Hagel said: "I don't think I said that. I said that we're always having to prepare - as we give the president options - prepare our assets and where they are and the capability of those assets to carry out the contingencies we give the president."

The defense official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the USS Mahan had finished its deployment and was due to head back to its home base in Norfolk, Virginia, but the commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet has decided to keep the ship in the region, the defense official said.

The official stressed the Navy had received no orders to prepare for any military operations regarding Syria.

The comments came as senior U.S. officials weighed choices ranging from increased diplomatic pressure to the use of force, including possible air strikes on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, administration sources said.

Hagel said he believed the international community was moving swiftly in getting the facts about what took place. At the same time, he cautioned that if Assad's forces did indeed use chemical weapons against its own people, that "there may be another attack coming." That adds urgency to any decisions by the international community, he said.

"So a very quick assessment of what happened, and whatever appropriate response should be made, that needs to happen within that time frame of responsible action," said Hagel, who declined to specify a time frame.

The Syrian government denies being responsible for the attack and has in the past accused rebels of using chemical weapons, an allegation that Western officials have dismissed.

Asked about the possibility of unilateral action, Hagel said the United States would never give up its sovereign right to act, but added that Syria was an international issue.

"The international community, I believe, should and will act in concert on these kinds of issues," he said. "If the intelligence and the facts bear out, which it appears to be what happened, use of chemical weapons, then that isn't just a United States issue. This is an international community issue."



headline: U.N. appeals to Sudan to continue transporting South's oil
headline: Egypt's bruised Brotherhood fails to show street power
byline: By Maggie Fick and Lin Noueihed
3:59pm EDT

Mass protests called by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood mostly failed to materialize on Friday as the movement reels from a bloody army crackdown on followers of ousted President Mohamed Mursi.

Troops and police had taken relatively low-key security measures before the "Friday of Martyrs" processions that were to have begun from 28 mosques in the capital after weekly prayers.

But midday prayers were canceled at some mosques and few major protests unfolded in Cairo, although witnesses said at least 1,000 people staged a march in the Mohandiseen district.

There were no reports of violence in that procession, but the Brotherhood's website said one person had been killed in the Nile Delta town of Tanta in clashes with security forces. The Interior Ministry confirmed the death.

Brotherhood supporters also turned out in Alexandria, several Delta towns, the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, the north Sinai town of Rafah, and Assiut in the south, with minor skirmishes reported in some places.

The Health Ministry said 54 people had been wounded on Friday in Cairo and two Delta provinces, without giving any details of the violence or who was injured.

"We are not afraid; it's victory or death," said Mohamed Abdel Azim, a retired oil engineer who was among about 100 people marching slowly from a mosque near Cairo University.

"They intend to strike at Muslims," the grey-bearded Azim said. "We'd rather die in dignity than live in oppression. We'll keep coming out until there's no one left."

Despite his defiant words, the mood of the protesters seemed subdued, perhaps a sign that the crackdown and the round-up of Brotherhood leaders has chilled the rank-and-file.

Some marchers carried posters of Mursi, who was toppled by army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on July 3 after huge demonstrations against his rule. "No to the coup," they chanted.

A militant Islamist group active in the lawless Sinai Peninsula threatened new attacks on the army and police. In a statement published on a jihadist website, the Salafi Jihadi group condemned security forces for what it called the "heinous crime" of killing Brotherhood supporters.

It was the first statement from any of the militant groups in the Sinai desert bordering Israel since last Wednesday's violent move by security forces on the Brotherhood sit-ins in Cairo.

The number of attacks on security forces in Sinai has jumped since the army removed Mursi. Suspected Islamist militants killed at least 24 policemen on Monday.

"GOD WILL BRING DOWN SISI"

At another small protest in Cairo, a veiled nursery teacher with four children, who gave her name as Nasra, said: "God will make us victorious, even if many of us are hurt and even if it takes a long time. God willing, God will bring down Sisi."

Egypt has endured the bloodiest civil unrest in its modern history since August 14 when police destroyed protest camps set up by Mursi's supporters in Cairo to demand his reinstatement.

The violence has alarmed Egypt's Western allies, although President Barack Obama acknowledged that even a decision to cut off U.S. aid to Cairo might not influence its armed forces.

But he said Washington was re-evaluating its ties with Egypt. "There's no doubt that we can't return to business as usual, given what's happened," he told CNN in an interview.

Some U.S. lawmakers have called for a halt to the $1.5 billion a year given mostly in military assistance to Egypt to bolster its 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Military cooperation includes privileged U.S. access to the Suez Canal.

The Brotherhood, hounded by the new army-backed rulers, had called for demonstrations across Egypt against the crackdown, testing the resilience of its battered support base.

Security forces kept a watchful eye, but did not flood the streets, even near Cairo's central Fateh mosque, where gun battles killed scores of people last Friday and Saturday.

The mosque's metal gates and big front door were locked and chained. Prayers were canceled. Two armored vehicles were parked down the street, where people shopped at a busy market.

Only one riot police truck stood by near Rabaa al-Adawiya square in northeastern Cairo, home to the Brotherhood's biggest protest vigil until police and troops stormed in, killing hundreds of people, bulldozing barricades and burning tents.

SYMBOLIC VICTORY

The mosque there was closed for repairs. Workmen in blue overalls stood on scaffolding as they covered its charred walls with white paint. Children scavenged through piles of garbage.

Troops used barbed wire to block a main road to Nahda Square, the site of the smaller of the two Brotherhood sit-ins.

The authorities declared a month-long state of emergency last week and they enforce a nightly curfew.

An official of the interim government said in a television interview on Friday that the state of emergency and curfew would be reconsidered if the security situation calmed.

Security forces have arrested many leading figures from the Brotherhood, all but decapitating an organization that won five successive votes in Egypt after the overthrow of autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

In a symbolic victory for the army-dominated old order, Mubarak, an ex-military man who ruled Egypt for 30 years, was moved out of jail on Thursday. His successor Mursi, Egypt's first freely-elected president, remains detained incommunicado.

The Brotherhood's "General Guide" Mohamed Badie, who was arrested on Tuesday, is due to go on trial on Sunday along with two other senior figures, Khairat al-Shater and Saad al-Katatni, on charges that include incitement to violence.

More than 1,000 people, including over 100 soldiers and police, have been killed since Mursi's overthrow. Brotherhood supporters say the toll is much higher.

Graffiti on a mosque wall in a rundown Cairo neighborhood illustrated the deep divisions that have emerged since Sisi's takeover. The spray-painted message "Yes to Sisi" had been crossed out and painted over with the word "traitor."

Slogans elsewhere read "Mursi is a spy" and "Mursi out". Someone had also written "Freedom, Justice, Brotherhood".

The Brotherhood, founded in 1928, emerged as Egypt's best-organized political force after Mubarak fell. Its popularity waned during Mursi's year in office when critics accused it of accumulating excessive power, pushing a partisan Islamist agenda and mismanaging the economy.

The Brotherhood, which the new government has threatened to dissolve entirely, says Mursi's administration was deliberately undermined by unreformed Mubarak-era institutions.

Mubarak, 85, still faces retrial on charges of complicity in the killings of protesters, but he left jail on Thursday for the first time since April 2011 and was flown by helicopter to a plush military hospital in the southern Cairo suburb of Maadi.

The authorities have used the state of emergency to keep him under house arrest, apparently to minimize the risk of popular anger if he had been given unfettered freedom.



headline: Initial Western intelligence finds Syrian forces used chemical weapons

Assad, according to American and European security sources.

The early intelligence finding could increase pressure for action by President Barack Obama, who made clear that he planned to tread cautiously even as his aides sought to narrow their differences in debate over possible military responses to the Syrian government.

The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, cautioned that the assessment was preliminary and, at this stage, they were still seeking conclusive proof, which could take days, weeks or even longer to gather.

But with a mounting international outcry over the apparent mass poisoning of hundreds of people, the issue appeared to have taken on a sense of urgency for the Obama administration.

In his first public comments since Wednesday's attack in the Damascus suburbs, Obama called the incident a "big event of grave concern" and one that demanded U.S. attention, but said he was in no rush to get war-weary Americans "mired" in another Middle East conflict.

Obama's wary response, which underscored a deep reluctance by Washington to intervene in Syria's 2-1/2-year-old civil war, came as senior U.S. officials weighed choices ranging from increased international sanctions to the use of force, including possible air strikes on Assad's forces, administration sources said.

A meeting of members of Obama's National Security Council, the Pentagon, State Department and intelligence agencies was held at the White House late on Thursday, but made no decisions on what to recommend, officials said.

With further talks planned as early as this weekend, a senior U.S. defense official said a decision on a course of action could come soon. But it appeared unlikely any military response would take place without extensive consultation with allies and further review of U.S. intelligence about the attack.

One U.S. official acknowledged that the participants aired "differing viewpoints," but pushed back against the notion that the administration, whose Syria policymaking has been marked by internal dissent in the past, was sharply divided on a response.

"It's not like people were screaming at each other," the official said.

International powers - including Russia, which has long shielded Assad from U.N. action - have urged Assad to cooperate with a U.N. inspection team that arrived on Sunday to pursue earlier allegations of chemical weapons attacks.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said there was "some evidence" of chemical weapons use in the latest incident, but stopped short of saying an official conclusion was reached.

The Syrian government denies being responsible and has in the past accused rebels of using chemical weapons, an allegation that Western officials have dismissed.

CROSSING THE 'RED LINE'

While the preliminary U.S. assessment was that Assad loyalists carried out Wednesday's attack with high-level authorization, one U.S. source closely monitoring events in the region said it was also possible that a local commander decided on his own to use gas to clear the way for a ground assault.

"What we've seen indicates that this is clearly a big event, of grave concern," Obama said in an interview on CNN's "New Day" program that aired on Friday, as anti-Assad rebels braved the front lines around Damascus to smuggle tissue samples to U.N. inspectors from victims of Wednesday's apparent mass poisoning.

Asked about his comment - made a year and a day before the toxic fumes hit sleeping residents of rebel-held Damascus suburbs - that chemical weapons would be a 'red line' for the United States, Obama expressed caution.

"If the U.S. goes in and attacks another country without a U.N. mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it," Obama said. "The notion that the U.S. can somehow solve what is a sectarian complex problem inside of Syria sometimes is overstated."

At Thursday's White House meeting, which lasted more than three hours, Obama's aides had a "robust discussion" of the diplomatic and military options available to the president, U.S. officials said.

Among the military options under consideration are targeted missile strikes on Syrian units believed responsible for chemical attacks or on Assad's air force and ballistic missile sites, U.S. officials said. Such strikes could be launched from U.S. ships or combat aircraft capable of firing missiles from outside Syrian airspace, thereby avoiding Syrian air defenses.

Seen as more risky - and unlikely - would be a sustained air assault, such as the one conducted in Libya in 2011.

Secretary of State John Kerry, who took part in Thursday's meeting by secure video link, advocated the use of air strikes in White House meetings in early June preceding an announcement of military aid to the rebels, a person familiar with the talks said. Joint Chiefs Chairman General Martin Dempsey argued that such a mission would be complex and costly.

The White House on Friday reiterated Obama's position that he did not intend to put "boots on the ground" in Syria, and an administration official said Thursday's meeting also steered clear of the idea of enforcing a "no-fly" zone there.

Another possibility would be to authorize sending heavier U.S. weaponry, such as shoulder-fired anti-aircraft rockets, to the rebels in addition to lighter arms approved in June. But even those limited supplies have yet to start flowing to the rebels.

The top Democrat on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee urged Obama on Friday to order air strikes against Assad's government.

Representative Eliot Engel cited Obama's statement that the use of chemical weapons by Assad's forces would cross a "red line" and cause the United States to act to halt such violations of international law.

"If we, in concert with our allies, do not respond to Assad's murderous uses of weapons of mass destruction, malevolent countries and bad actors around the world will see a green light where one was never intended," Engel wrote in a letter to Obama and obtained by Reuters.

'CREDIBILITY ISSUE'

With Obama's international prestige seen on the line, a former senior U.S. official said the suspected chemical attack was likely to prompt Obama to use limited force, but he did not expect him to try to topple Assad.

"They will feel obliged to do something because â&euro;Ś the credibility issue is very high here," the former official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Something like a finite use of stand-off force is quite possible here."

Obama's failure to confront Assad with the serious consequences he has long threatened would likely reinforce a global perception of a president preoccupied with domestic matters and unwilling to act decisively in the volatile Middle East, a picture already set by his mixed response to the crisis in Egypt.

The consensus in Washington and allied capitals is that a concerted international response can only succeed if the United States takes the lead.

But Obama has shown no appetite for intervention. Polls by Reuters/Ipsos and others have shown that most Americans, weary of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, are increasingly aware of the Syria conflict but remain opposed to U.S. involvement there.



headline: On Syria, Obama says no rush toward costly interventions
byline: By Erika Solomon
6:20pm EDT

President Barack Obama called the apparent gassing of hundreds of Syrian civilians a "big event of grave concern" but stressed on Friday he was in no rush to embroil Americans in a costly new war.

As opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad braved the frontlines around Damascus to smuggle out tissue samples from victims of Wednesday's mass poisoning, Obama brushed over an interviewer's reminder that he once called chemical weapons a "red line" that could trigger U.S. action.

A White House spokesman reiterated Obama's position that he did not expect to have "boots on the ground" in Syria.

Obama's caution contrasted with calls for action from NATO allies, including France, Britain and Turkey, where leaders saw little doubt Assad's forces had staged pre-dawn missile strikes that rebels say killed between 500 and well over 1,000 people.

But two years into a civil war that has divided the Middle East along sectarian lines, a split between Western governments and Russia once again illustrated the international deadlock that has thwarted outside efforts to halt the killing.

While the West accused Assad of a cover-up by preventing the U.N. team from visiting the scene, Moscow said the rebels were impeding an investigation.

The United Nations released data showing that a million children were among refugees forced to flee Syria, calling it a "shameful milestone". And mosque bombings that left at least 42 dead and hundreds wounded in neighboring Lebanon were a reminder of how Syria's conflict has spread. But, for now, there seems little prospect of an end to the violence.

According to U.S. and European security sources, U.S. and allied intelligence agencies have made a preliminary assessment that Syrian government forces did use chemical weapons in the attack this week and that the act likely had high-level approval from President Bashar al-Assad's government.

Obama played down the chances of Assad cooperating with the U.N. experts who might provide conclusive evidence of what happened, if given access soon.

Noting budget constraints, problems of international law and a continuing U.S. casualty toll in Afghanistan, Obama told CNN:

"Sometimes what we've seen is that folks will call for immediate action, jumping into stuff that does not turn out well, gets us mired in very difficult situations, can result in us being drawn into very expensive, difficult, costly interventions that actually breed more resentment in the region.

"The United States continues to be the one country that people expect can do more than just simply protect their borders. But that does not mean that we have to get involved with everything immediately," he said, reflecting long-standing wariness to follow the example of his predecessor, George W. Bush, and his ultimately unpopular ventures in Afghanistan and Iraq.

"We have to think through strategically what's going to be in our long-term national interests."

RED LINE?

Asked about his comment - made a year and a day before the toxic fumes hit sleeping residents of rebel-held Damascus suburbs - that chemical weapons would be a 'red line' for the United States, he replied: "If the U.S. goes in and attacks another country without a U.N. mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it."

Russia and China have vetoed United Nations Security Council moves against Assad in the past and oppose military action.

Having abstained to allow NATO powers a U.N. mandate to back Libyan rebels against Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Moscow and Beijing have closed ranks against what they see as a desire by Western states to change other countries' systems of government.

The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, despite a failure to secure a specific U.N. mandate for it, led to long wrangling over whether Washington and its allies broke international law.

In June, Washington agreed in response to evidence of small chemical attacks to arm rebel groups, despite misgivings about Islamist radicals in their ranks, some allied with al Qaeda. But rebel leaders say it is too little, leaving only a stalemate.

INSPECTION TEAM

International powers, including Moscow, have urged Assad to cooperate with the U.N. inspection team which arrived on Sunday to pursue earlier allegations of chemical weapons attacks.

However, there was no public response from the Syrian government, whose forces have been pounding the region for days, making any mission by the international experts perilous - as well as possibly destroying evidence. Syria denies being responsible and has in the past accused rebels of using gas.

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he intends to conduct a "thorough, impartial and prompt investigation" into the latest allegations. Top U.N. disarmament official Angela Kane was due to arrive in Damascus on Saturday to push for access to the site for the U.N. inspectors.

"I can think of no good reason why any party - either government or opposition forces - would decline this opportunity to get to the truth of the matter," Ban said.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he believed the Syrian government was responsible for the casualties, which go on rising as medical staff and others fall sick. "It seems the Assad regime has something to hide," he said.

"Why else have they not allowed the U.N. team to go there?" he added, saying that the attack was "not something that a humane and civilized world" could ignore.

But Russia, Assad's main arms supplier, said the opposition was preventing the objective investigation of what happened.

In an apparent rebuttal of that, Syria's opposition pledged to guarantee the safety of U.N. inspectors.

"We will ensure the safety of the U.N. team ... It is critical that those inspectors get there within 48 hours," Khaled Saleh, spokesman for the opposition Syrian National Coalition, told a news conference in Istanbul.

Opposition activists said they had been in contact with the specialist U.N. team in Damascus and had sent tissue samples with couriers trying to slip across from the Ghouta region into the government-held center to deliver them to the inspectors.

Speaking from the town of Arbin, one of those affected by mysterious deaths from poisoning, opposition activist Abu Nidal told Reuters: "The U.N. team spoke with us and since then we prepared for them samples of hair, skin and blood and smuggled them back into Damascus with trusted couriers."

Activist Abu Mohammed, in Harasta, said: "We're being shelled and on top of that Ghouta is surrounded by regime checkpoints. But even that isn't a problem - we can smuggle them out. The problem is the location of the U.N. committee in the hotel. They're under heavy guard and government minders."

Another opposition leader, Syrian National Coalition Secretary General Badr Jamous, said in Istanbul that samples from victims had already been smuggled out of Syria for testing. He declined to say where they were sent.

The rebels' efforts could prove futile; only material that has a clear provenance and a "chain of custody" would generally be treated as evidence by U.N. inspectors.

The longer the team waits for permission to investigate, the less likely it is to get to the bottom of an incident in which opponents say Syrian government forces fired rockets or missiles laden with poison gas canisters into rebel-held neighborhoods.

Western experts suspect an organophosphate agent, most likely sarin gas, was used in the attack.

"Because they are non-persistent agents, they dissipate very quickly," said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former head of Britain's military counter-nuclear, biological and chemical warfare force and now a private contractor.

Images, including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters, showed scores of bodies laid out on floors with no visible signs of injury. Some had foam at the nose and mouth.

CALLS FOR ACTION

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on Thursday that world powers must respond with force if allegations that Syria's government was responsible for the deadliest chemical attack on civilians in a quarter-century prove true. Fabius stressed, however, there was no question of sending in troops.

European officials said that options ranging from air strikes or a no-fly zone to providing heavy weapons to some rebels were all still on the table. But there was little prospect of concrete measures without U.S. backing. "Without U.S. firepower, there's little we can do," one said.

Turkey, fearful of instability on its long southern border, called for an end to talk and time-wasting. "There is nothing left to say now," said President Abdullah Gul. "It is now time for actual concrete action ... The price of playing down the events and procrastinating through diplomatic maneuvering and trickery in the U.N. Security Council will be very high."

Three people were missing after a helicopter carrying 18 people crashed into the sea off the coast of Scotland on Friday.

The Coastguard said 15 people had been rescued and were taken to hospital, but three are unaccounted for.

The incident happened near the Shetland Islands, northeast of Edinburgh, and involved a Super Puma helicopter taking 16 passengers and two crew members to and from oil and gas platforms.

The Department of Transport issued an statement on behalf on the Air Accidents Investigation Branch stating it was "aware of incident" and has deployed a team.

An air and sea search is continuing, with three helicopters and two lifeboats involved.

"Our two lifeboats are searching for those three unaccounted for," said Tim Ash, a spokesman for Royal National Lifeboat Institution.

Wreckage from the crash has been spotted, said Ash, who added that rescue teams were dealing with strong tides and poor visibility.

"Winds are not particularly strong but visibility is not good. Those are the circumstances that our volunteers are facing," he said.

A spokeswoman for the Coastguard said two life rafts from the helicopter were located and found empty.

"They are still searching but they will stand down at some point and then resume at first light," she added.



headline: Bombs kill 42 outside mosques in Lebanon's Tripoli

6:20pm EDT

Bombs hit two mosques in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli on Friday, killing at least 42 people and wounding hundreds, intensifying sectarian strife that has spilled over from the civil war in neighboring Syria.

The apparently coordinated blasts - the biggest and deadliest in Tripoli since the end of Lebanon's own civil war - struck as locals were finishing Friday prayers in the largely Sunni Muslim city. Lebanese officials appealed for calm.

The explosions in Tripoli, 70 km (40 miles) from the capital Beirut, came a week after a huge car bomb killed at least 24 people in a part of Beirut controlled by the Shi'ite Muslim militant movement Hezbollah.

A recent resurgence of sectarian violence in Lebanon has been stoked by the conflagration in Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad is fighting a largely Sunni-led rebellion. Both Hezbollah and radical Sunni groups in Lebanon have sent fighters over the border to support opposing sides in Syria.

Medical and security sources said the death toll from Friday's blasts in Tripoli had risen to 42 by late afternoon. Hundreds more were wounded, they said.

The first explosion hit the Taqwa mosque, frequented by hardline Sunni Islamists, and killed at least 14 people there, according to accounts earlier in the day.

Further deaths were reported from a second blast a few minutes later outside the al-Salam mosque, which the Interior Ministry said was hit by a car laden with 100 kg (220 pounds) of explosives.

foot) stretch of the road was charred black and the twisted remains of cars littered the area.

"We were just bowing down to pray for the second time and the bomb went off. The air cleared, and I looked around me and saw bodies," said Samir Jadool, 39.

Lebanon's Red Cross said more than 500 people were wounded in the two explosions. Television footage showed people running through the streets, some of them carrying bloodied victims.

Near the Taqwa mosque blast site, angry men toting AK-47 assault rifles took to the streets and fired in the air while other men threw rocks at Lebanese soldiers nearby.

"Back off," said one militant, when journalists approached the scene. Soldiers peeked out at the mosque from a nearby base but did not approach it.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the bombings and called on all Lebanese people to "exercise restraint, to remain united, and to support their state institutions, particularly the security forces".

"BEGINNING OF THE STORM"

Witnesses at the scene of the blasts said anger was rising among locals, who were shouting out accusations that Assad's government or Hezbollah were behind the attack.

"This is the work of a criminal," seethed Jadool, who held a bloodied bandage against his head, the result of flying debris from the blast at the al-Salam mosque.

Video obtained by local news channel LBC showed the moment of the explosion at al-Salam mosque. The blast ripped through a wall of the mosque, showering clouds of dust on people sitting on prayer mats and sending dozens running out of the building.

Lebanese officials called for calm as tensions rose in Tripoli, a Mediterranean port that has seen some of the worst Syria spillover violence. Sunni gunmen have sporadically clashed with fighters from the city's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam to which the Assad family belongs.

Former internal security chief Ashraf Rifi, whose home was damaged by the second blast, warned Lebanon was facing a growing threat. "We are still in the beginning of the storm and we must remain aware and try to protect this nation," he said, speaking outside his home. "This storm has become a huge, grave danger."

Officials in Tripoli called on the government in a joint statement to step up security in the city. Mohammed Kabara, a member of parliament who read out the statement, accused the Syrian government of carrying out the Beirut and Tripoli bombings to create strife in Lebanon.

Prominent Salafist sheik, Dai al-Islam Shahhal, also blamed the Syrian government for the Tripoli bombs and said it was "pure terrorism".

Hezbollah released a statement condemning the Tripoli blasts and expressing solidarity with the victims, saying they were targets of efforts to fan more violence in Lebanon.

"We consider this the completion of an effort to plunge Lebanon into chaos and destruction," the statement said.

Hezbollah's political opponents called on the group to withdraw its forces from Syria in response to Friday's attack.

Lebanese Defence Minister Fayez Ghosn warned against being dragged into deeper sectarian bloodshed. "We are calling for calm and vigilance, because the aim of this (the bombings) is to stoke strife between sects," he told LBC.

Salem al-Rafei, chief cleric of the Taqwa mosque, is a staunch supporter of Syrian Sunni rebels as well as Lebanese Sunni militants who have joined the anti-Assad battle in Syria.



headline: Suicide bomber targets busy Baghdad cafe, killing 25

6:20pm EDT

A suicide bomber killed 25 people and wounded more than 50 in Baghdad on Friday when he detonated his explosives inside a busy cafe near a park popular with families, police and medical sources said.

It was one of the worst attacks in Iraq since suicide bombers hit the same district two months ago, targeting a Shi'ite mosque and killing 29 worshippers during noon prayers.

Friday's bombing took place in al-Qahira, a northern district of the capital that is home to mainly Shi'ite Muslims. Children were among the casualties at the site, which is in an area with cafes and restaurants. The wounded had been taken to four different hospitals, the sources said.

"There was a crowd of people, and the suicide bomber detonated himself right inside it. Most of the people were killed or injured by ball bearings from the device," police officer Ahmed Jassim said.

His patrol heard the blast and arrived at the site to find people lying dead or injured on the ground in pools of blood. Police hesitated to help the wounded because they feared a second bomb, he said.

In a separate attack in central Baghdad, gunmen on motorcycles shot dead four people who were in a car, police and health sources said.

Iraqis have suffered extreme violence for years, but since the start of 2013 the intensity of attacks on civilians has dramatically increased. More than 1,000 Iraqis were killed in attacks in July, the worst monthly toll since 2008.

Since the start of 2013, bomb attacks by mainly Sunni Muslim insurgents have increasingly targeted cafes and other places where families gather, as well as the usual targets of military facilities and checkpoints.

Eighteen months since U.S. troops withdrew, deep-rooted sectarian tensions have been aggravated by the civil war in neighboring Syria and growing political divisions between Shi'ite, Sunni and ethnic Kurdish factions.



headline: Ivory Coast lawmakers pass critical land, nationality laws
byline: By Ange Aboa
6:20pm EDT

Ivory Coast's parliament on Friday approved new laws to ease access to citizenship for millions of foreigners and improve state regulation of land ownership, two issues at the heart of a decade of political crisis and violence.

Immigrants from Ivory Coast's arid neighbors flocked to the West African nation following independence in 1960, lured by then President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's promises of land for anyone willing to develop it for agriculture.

The open-door policy helped build Ivory Coast into the world's top cocoa grower and a regional economic powerhouse. But millions of immigrants and their children were unable to become Ivorian nationals.

When soldiers launched a failed coup attempt in 2002, igniting a civil war that divided the country between a rebel-held north and loyalist south, they claimed to be fighting discrimination against northerners and foreigners.

Changes to the laws on nationality and land tenure were conditions of the first peace agreement signed between the government and the rebels in 2003.

"The political crisis ... put back on the agenda the question of the abnormally prolonged foreign status of certain populations," President Alassane Ouattara wrote in an introduction to one of the proposed nationality laws.

"Despite having entirely integrated the social fabric and considering themselves Ivorian, (they) remain legally non-nationals," he wrote.

Ouattara was himself initially barred from running for the presidency amid accusations he was of foreign origin.

He won a 2010 election, but incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo refused to accept his defeat leading to months of fighting that killed an estimated 3,000 people.

Lawmakers passed two laws concerning nationality on Friday. One will allow foreigners to acquire Ivorian citizenship upon marriage to an Ivorian national.

The second will allow foreign-born residents living in Ivory Coast since before independence to become citizens along with their descendents. Foreign nationals born in Ivory Coast between 1961 and 1973 and their children will also qualify.

Parliament also voted to extend by 10 years a grace period for the implementation of a 1998 law meant to codify land transactions.

Land sales in Ivory Coast are currently carried out according to traditional customs, and the law is intended to give them legal weight. However it was never applied.

The resulting vagueness surrounding land sales, coupled with the requirement that landowners must be Ivorian citizens, is at the root of simmering conflicts in Ivory Coast's western cocoa heartland.

Landholders will now have 10 years to prove their legal claim to their properties. Those unable to do so will lose their land to the state.

headline: Kremlin critic says he would allow gay rallies if elected mayor
byline: By Steve Gutterman
7:26pm EDT

An opposition leader running for mayor of Moscow said on Friday he would allow gay rights rallies if elected, making clear he believes the authorities' frequent practice of denying them permission is unconstitutional.

Alexei Navalny, who is seeking to boost the opposition and increase his own political clout by challenging the Kremlin-appointed acting mayor, weighed in on an issue that has gained prominence in Russia and drawn the attention of the world.

Western governments have criticized a law against spreading gay "propaganda" among minors, part of the conservative course President Vladimir Putin has charted in his third term following protests against his 13-year rule.

Polls show most Russians support the law, which activists say amounts to a ban on gay rights rallies. It has hurt Putin's image in the United States and Europe and led to calls for a boycott of the 2014 Olympics in February in Sochi, Russia.

For years, Moscow authorities have denied applicants permission to hold gay rights marches, and attempts to demonstrate have often ended in attacks by anti-gay activists who call themselves allies of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Navalny, a leader of the protests that erupted in December 2011 but which have since faded, said he would change that.

"The constitution says that everyone can (demonstrate), and the mayor of Moscow cannot ... forbid this," he said when asked about gay rights rallies in an interview on Ekho Moskvy radio.

"I will adhere to the constitution. The constitution says all people have the right to demonstrate peacefully and unarmed" Navalny," he added.

"If everyone is clothed and marches in an orderly way with their slogans, I do not care at all what their sexual orientation is, where they are going and what they are saying."

Navalny, 37, was sentenced to five years in prison last month for theft after a trial he has said was Putin's revenge for his opposition activities, but he is free pending a ruling on his appeal.

Opinion polls suggest Navalny has no chance of beating acting mayor Sergei Sobyanin, appointed by the Kremlin in 2010, but he believes he might have a chance if Sobyanin falls short of the simple majority needed to avoid a runoff.

In the interview, Navalny also set out a position on labor migrants that may appeal to Muscovites wary of foreigners, saying all people from ex-Soviet states of Central Asia and the Caucasus should be required to obtain visas to enter Russia.

He said performing a regional folk dance on a square outside the Kremlin - something that has stirred ethnic tension in recent years - would be a "violation of public order".

headline: U.N. Intervention Brigade fires on Congo rebel positions

7:26pm EDT

A special U.N. brigade formed to neutralize armed groups in Congo has taken its first military action, firing artillery at rebels menacing the border city of Goma, U.N. and Congolese military officers said on Friday.

The force of Tanzanian, South African and Malawian soldiers was backing the Congolese army against M23 fighters, whose brief occupation of the city last year damaged the image of the U.N. mission in Congo and led the Security Council to create the brigade.

The United Nations pledged in July to prevent the rebels from getting back within range of the city of about a million people on the Rwandan border.

But M23 this week entered a security zone ringing Goma that was established by the new, robustly-mandated Intervention Brigade earlier this month.

At least three people were killed on Thursday when shells landed on the city.

Colonel Felix Basse told Reuters by telephone from Goma referring to Thursday's fighting.

Clashes between M23 and the Congolese army resumed early on Friday with peacekeepers again involved to hold back the rebels.

"Not just the Intervention Brigade but the complete MONUSCO force is acting to protect Goma," Basse said, adding that the army had by late afternoon taken territory from the rebels, including a strategic hill in Kibati, 11 km (7 miles) north of the city.

A Congolese army spokesman acknowledged the brigade was supporting government troops with artillery fire.

Meanwhile an M23 spokesman claimed the rebels were trying to avoid direct clashes but would respond to attacks.

"If the army carries on attacking us we're going to defend ourselves," Amani Kabasha said.

M23 has rejected responsibility for shelling Goma, but U.N. officials were quick to accuse the rebels of deliberately targeting civilians and U.N. positions. France followed suit.

" particularly condemns the attacks perpetrated by M23 against the civilian population and installations of MONUSCO, which constitute war crimes," a foreign ministry spokesman said on Friday.

READY OR NOT

Though it received its mandate in March, only around 2,000 of the Intervention Brigade's total force of 3,000 troops are currently in place in Congo and supplies and weaponry are still en route from contributing countries.

But Jason Stearns, director of the Rift Valley Institute's Usalama Project, said the force had little choice but to engage.

"The current fighting comes at a time of almost unparalleled pressure on the U.N. mission to do something. Unfortunately, it also comes before their Intervention Brigade is completely operational," he said.

The special brigade was established after M23 fighters marched past U.N. soldiers to briefly seize Goma last November.

The rebels withdrew after receiving promises of peace talks with the Congolese government. But the city's fall dealt a serious blow to the image of MONUSCO - with 17,000 troops the world's largest U.N. mission - and the U.N. is under pressure to ensure Goma is not retaken.

Some in the Intervention Brigade's contributing countries have voiced concern over their troops' daunting task of fighting and disarming rebel groups in the difficult terrain of Congo's volatile eastern borderlands.

A military spokesman in South Africa, which saw 14 of its soldiers killed in clashes with rebels in the Central African Republic in March, said South African troops had not been involved in clashes with M23.

"The fight is taking place near where our troops are positioned. We have a defensive line but we have not engaged," Siphiwe Dlamini said.



headline: Syrian opposition says has smuggled attack samples out of Syria

Assad had smuggled samples from victims of an alleged chemical weapons attack out of Syria for testing by experts.

"We took them and sent them outside Syria," Syrian National Coalition Secretary General Badr Jamous told Reuters in Istanbul, but declined to say where the samples had been sent.

President Bashar al-Assad is under increasing international pressure to allow U.N. inspectors access to the rebel-held site of Wednesday's reported mass poisoning, which if confirmed would be the world's deadliest chemical attack in decades.

The opposition coalition said it would ensure the safety of U.N. chemical weapons inspectors in areas of Syria it controls.

"We will ensure the safety of the U.N. team ... It is critical that those inspectors get there within 48 hours," coalition spokesman Khaled Saleh told a news conference.

Saleh's comments were an apparent rebuttal of suggestions from Moscow earlier that the opposition was preventing an objective investigation into allegations that the Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons attack.

"Much needed signals from the opposition, including its readiness to guarantee the safety and effective work of U.N. experts on territory controlled by militants, unfortunately are not forthcoming," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

"It is directly preventing an objective investigation into the possible use of chemical weapons in Syria."

Syrian activists have said they are trying to get body tissue samples from victims of the attack near Damascus to the team of U.N. inspectors staying in a hotel a few miles away.

The U.N. experts have been in Syria since Sunday to investigate three previous alleged chemical attacks in the country dating from months ago.

In what it said was a preliminary report into Wednesday's attack based on multiple sources, including a source within Assad's forces and testimony from opposition activists, the opposition coalition said 16 missiles were launched in an initial assault shortly after 2:30 a.m. (2330 GMT).

Local residents reported missiles falling in the Zamalka neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of the capital, far from the front lines, and hundreds of people died in their homes as exposure to the gas spread, the report said, noting that not all of the missiles were carrying chemical warheads.

It said a second district came under missile attack around ten minutes later and that shortly after 4:00 a.m. another 18 missiles were launched towards a southern suburb. Citing activists, it said four of the missiles to hit that neighborhood were loaded with chemical weapons.

"Medical reports show the victims exhibited symptoms consistent with exposure to sarin gas," the report said.

"However, we cannot definitively ascertain the exact nature of the materials and the deployment method used to target civilians in the Damascus suburbs," it said, and urged an immediate visit by the U.N. inspectors.

moon said on Friday he intends to conduct a "thorough, impartial and prompt investigation" into the latest alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria, an issue his top disarmament official will raise in Damascus shortly.

A United Nations statement said U.N. High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Angela Kane was due to arrive in the Syrian capital on Saturday to push for access to the reported attack site for U.N. inspectors, who were already in Syria to investigate previous chemical attack claims.

"It is (Ban's) intention to conduct a thorough, impartial and prompt investigation on the reports of the alleged use of chemical weapons during these attacks," U.N. spokesman Eduardo del Buey said in the statement.

"The secretary-general urges the Syrian authorities to respond positively and promptly to his request without delay, taking into account in particular that the Syrian Government has publicly expressed its own concerns regarding these events," he said.

It is the second day in a row Ban publicly appealed to Syria to grant the U.N. experts access to the alleged attack site.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government is under increasing pressure from Western and Gulf Arab countries and Assad's ally Russia to allow access to the rebel-held site of Wednesday's alleged pre-dawn attack. The opposition Syrian National Coalition has also urged U.N. access.

Assad opponents braved the front lines around Damascus on Friday to smuggle tissue samples to U.N. inspectors from victims of Wednesday's reported mass poisoning, which if confirmed would be the world's deadliest chemical attack in decades.

So far Assad's government has not said whether it will allow chief U.N. chemical investigator Ake Sellstrom's team to visit the site in the suburbs east of Damascus. Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari has not responded to a Reuters query about possible access for Sellstrom's team.

The U.N. experts have been in Syria since Sunday to investigate three previous alleged chemical attacks in the country's 2-year-old civil war dating from months ago.

STOCKPILES OF WEAPONS

Assad opponents gave death tolls from the attack ranging from 500 to well over 1,000. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons.

The United Nations has received a total of 14 reports of possible chemical attacks - one from Syria's government and the rest from Britain, France and the United States.

The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday stopped short of demanding an immediate investigation of the incident by Sellstrom's team, though it did voice support for Ban's intention to pursue a swift inquiry.

The Syrian government and the opposition have accused each other of using chemical weapons, and both have denied doing so. The U.N. inquiry will try to establish only whether chemical weapons were used, not who used them.

Ban said on Monday that if the experts found that chemical weapons had been used then it would be up to "the international community to determine what course of action should be taken to prove ... accountability and what needs to be done."

"Use of chemical weapons is a violation of international law and international human rights law," Ban told a news conference.

The United Nations has been demanding unfettered access in Syria to conduct the investigation. Sellstrom's team consists of experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the World Health Organization.

Ban appointed Sellstrom to lead the inquiry in March, but diplomatic wrangling and concerns over safety prevented his team from entering Syria until this week.

Syria is one of seven countries that have not joined the 1997 convention banning chemical weapons. Western countries believe it has stockpiles of undeclared mustard gas, sarin and VX nerve agents.

The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict since 2011.



headline: Libya oil port blockade reflects national disarray
byline: By Tom Heneghan
7:26pm EDT

The regional unrest blocking Libyan oil ports is a microcosm of the disarray plaguing the country and sapping the authority of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan's shaky central government, Libyan and foreign analysts say.

While local autonomy activists have been holding ports in the east, the legislature in the capital Tripoli in western Libya has been full of talk of voting no confidence in Zeidan.

The Muslim Brotherhood seems to be gaining influence amid the crises shaking the country, the analysts say, and the army ousting of Egypt's Islamist government may have prompted some Libyan radicals to step up violence against secular critics.

The Brotherhood and more radical Islamists active in several countries across the region bring a politicized form of Islam that is foreign to the area's traditional religious practices.

But Libya is so split along political, regional and tribal lines two years after the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi that no one group can effectively take control, they said.

Even factors as visible as the state of security in Tripoli are so fluid that residents cannot agree about them. "It's improved," one told Reuters by telephone. "It was pretty bad last week, with lots of attacks," another reported.

"Libya is essentially beholden to local and regional interest groups," said Henry Smith of the Control Risks consultancy group. "The government doesn't really have the coercive capacity to be able to stop them."

The ports blockage, a major factor in a 70 percent drop in Libya's oil exports, stems mostly from regionalists aiming to seize control over oil revenues to benefit the autonomous area they want to establish in the eastern region of Cyrenaica.

REGIONAL RIVALRY

The region, centered around Benghazi, has traditionally been a rival to Tripoli in the west and the ports blockage has been the most dramatic step regionalists have taken to press their demands for regional control of the oil riches.

"They're talking about a federal way of running the country," said Salah Gaouda, vice chairman of the Tripoli parliament's national security committee. He declined to discuss this political aspect of the standoff.

Regionalist sentiment has also stirred in the southern region of Fezzan, where local tribes who accuse Tripoli of underfunding them have begun calling for autonomous status too.

The legislature, or General National Congress (GNC), can hardly deal with these challenges because it is deadlocked in a standoff between its largest bloc, the secular National Forces Alliance, and the second-largest led by the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Alliance is officially boycotting the GNC but sometimes attends sessions, leaving Libyans confused about what is happening in their national assembly.

Tripoli analysts also report uncertainty about Zeidan's future after GNC members seemed ready to call a vote of no-confidence. Zeidan's deputy prime minister and interior minister both quit this month in disagreement with him.

On Tuesday, Zeidan told the GNC he would not resign and they would have to vote him out. "Other names to replace him were mentioned, but nobody came forward," said a Tripoli analyst who asked not to be named. "There was no vote."

RISE IN VIOLENCE

Another Libyan expert, who also requested anonymity, said the Muslim Brotherhood's Justice and Construction Party had grown in influence in the GNC since the Alliance boycott began.

"The GNC is losing its legitimacy," he said.

GNC President Nouri Abusahmain, an independent member, has boosted Brotherhood influence in Tripoli by bringing in men from the so-called Libyan Shield militia to boost security in the capital after a wave of violence there.

"They are mostly from Misrata and under the command of a Muslim brother," the expert said.

With no effective army or police, Tripoli's security is tested by rival militias that often clash with each other over control of parts of the city.

Benghazi, Libya's second city, has seen a rise in violence in recent weeks against secular political activists that seems to be partly stoked by Islamist forces there, both Smith and the Libyan expert said.

But Smith stressed this did not imply a larger coalition of interests in the east between the Muslim Brotherhood and the federalists, because the Islamists saw the latter as a source of division.

GNC security official Gaouda said escaped criminals were also targeting judicial officials and attacking court buildings, hoping to take revenge for their jailing and destroy any records of their time behind bars.

The Libyan expert expressed fears the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists could lead to the emergence of a jihadist zone near the Egyptian border that fugitive Egyptian Islamists could use as a base against their homeland.

Smith thought local tribes would oppose any "rear base", such as Egyptian militants seem to have established in the Sinai region, because that could lead to the closing of the border with Egypt they want to keep open for trade.

The risk analyst said many Libyans hoped that Tripoli could exert more control once a new constitution was finally drawn up, but he said more work would be needed.

Libya's instability "will probably persist beyond having a constitution", he said. "People need to regain faith in the state, the state needs to reassert itself in some way, and all that is going to take a lot of time."

appointed Roma king Florin Cioaba, who died at the weekend.

They lined the roads in silence as Cioaba's coffin was driven in a convoy 7km (4 miles) from his home to a cemetery, with riot police and private security guards in attendance.

"The king is dead, long live the kings," relatives had shouted earlier beside his coffin as his two sons were named monarchs in his place, and crowns made of gold coins placed on their heads.

Cioaba died of a heart attack in a Turkish hospital on Sunday, aged 58. He proclaimed himself king in 1997, taking over the ceremonial role from his father. He was a popular leader in the Roma community, and pushed for modernization and education.

He counted as a friend Romanian President Traian Basescu, who brought a wreath to Cioaba's home earlier in the week but did not attend the funeral.

There are an estimated 10 million Roma living across Europe, and they are one of its oldest minorities. The Council of Europe, which monitors human rights, says they are also the most discriminated against minority on the continent.

The majority of Europe's Roma live in the Balkans, and there are about 2 million in Romania where many of them struggle with prejudice, poverty and high illiteracy rates.

Before the funeral procession left Cioaba's home in Sibiu, central Romania, representatives of the International Romani Union crowned his two sons, Dorin and Daniel, as international king of Roma and king of Roma in Romania, respectively.

"My brother and I will complement each other and we will try to come close to my father's worth, which will be difficult," Dorin Cioaba, the eldest son, told reporters.

Their father set up a council in 2010 to mediate disputes inside the community.

Cioaba was no stranger to controversy. In 2003, he drew the ire of the EU and Romanian officials when he married his 12-year-old daughter Ana Maria to a 15-year-old boy against her will, in accordance with an ancient Roma custom. Cioaba himself married his wife Maria at the age of 14.

producing region late last year.

In the past week, government satellite images show more than 400 fires were ignited in territory belonging to Xavante Indians in Mato Grosso state, according to the indigenous affairs agency Funai.

The Maraiwatsede reserve, which Reuters profiled in a special report in April, has become an emblematic case of rising tensions in Brazil as farmers push into new territory, hoping to profit from the country's surging output of corn, soybeans and other commodities in recent years.

Hundreds of such land disputes have erupted nationwide, prompting President Dilma Rousseff to intervene to try to prevent violence. In Maraiwatsede, the federal government ordered some 7,000 non-Indian residents to leave without compensation after courts ruled last year that the land belonged to the Indians.

The government had officially made the land an indigenous reserve in 1998, but some non-Indian farmers and ranchers stayed on.

Violent protests by gun-bearing ranchers broke out when the evictions were ordered in October of last year, prompting federal troops to fire rubber bullets and tear gas.

The apparent arson in Maraiwatsede suggests former farm owners are still seeking revenge, and tensions may continue to escalate on remote agricultural frontiers.

Brazil's Indian affairs agency "believes it is quite possible that this is a retaliation against the evictions," said Tatiana Vilaça, the agency's coordinator for prevention of illicit activity, in a phone interview from Brasilia.

Brazil has followed a mandate in its 1988 constitution and set aside nearly 13 percent of its vast territory for Indian reservations to try to address historical wrongs. Enforcement has only become an issue since the crop boom. (Many of the reserves are in the uninhabited Amazon and aren't as controversial.) Rousseff, however, has pledged to protect private property and has occasionally been forced to send troops to disputed land.

State and federal laws frequently don't match up in Brazil, and farmers say they have legitimate property titles on land the federal government says was made into Indian reservations based on anthropological studies.

Rousseff's government has indicated it will start paying farmers and ranchers for territory on other existing reservations across Brazil and slow the approval of new territories.

Vilaça said firefighters dispatched to Maraiwatsede reported seeing outsiders with trucks near the flames. Funai lacks evidence of anyone starting the fires and has asked federal police to find the perpetrators and give the Indians more security.

Mato Grosso state police in Alto Boa Vista, a town bordering the reserve, said some residents had accused the Indians of starting the fires. State police do not plan to investigate as Indian reserves are federal territories, a spokeswoman said.

The government's environmental affairs agency, Ibama, said 31,000 of Maraiwatsede's 165,000 hectares, an area about the size of greater London, had been scorched by flames of "criminal origin" as of August 16. The agency said the frequency of the fires means they can't be natural, and the fact they are started close to roads suggests they were set by outsiders. No injuries have been reported.

"There is a risk of the fires losing control and spreading to fields and property outside of the reserve," Ibama said in a written statement.

Maraiwatsede straddles Brazil's Amazon rain forest and the dry, savannah-like Cerrado, which is prone to fire in the August dry season that precedes the start of soy and corn planting.

Between July 15 and August 15 Ibama reported 654 fires started on Indian lands in Brazil's top soy state, Mato Grosso, not all of them criminal. Funai's Vilaça said fires on Indian territory are common because tribes use flames for cooking and ceremonies, but Maraiwatsede was clearly a criminal attack.

Xavante Chief Damião Paridzané, who was taken away from the area by the Brazilian army as a young boy in 1966 and has spent much of his adult life lobbying authorities and protesting to recover ancestral territory, previously told Reuters he wants the deforested land to again become worthy of the name Maraiwatsede, which means thick forest in Xavante.

Brazil's powerful farm lobby sharply criticized Rousseff, a pragmatic leftist expected to run for reelection next year, for going so far as to bulldoze an entire city in Maraiwatsede and ordering productive farmland to be left to Indians, who want it to return to its natural state with only small-scale agriculture.



headline: Smuggling bonanza on Turkish border as Syrian war drags on

up cars and trucks weighed down with blue jerry cans rumbles along the muddy lane, ferrying fuel smuggled into Turkey from over the border in Syria.

The thousands of liters of diesel that make their way by cover of darkness to Turkey's southern Hatay province are a financial lifeline for Syria's rebels, as well as a source of income for Turkish middlemen.

Much of the oil is sourced from Syria's eastern Deir al-Zor province, a region critical to the country's overall output, which largely fell under the control of a network of tribes and smugglers earlier this year.

Fuel is heavily taxed in Turkey, meaning the black market for illegal imports from Syria, however crudely refined in makeshift facilities, is thriving and sends cash back to the rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.

Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition throughout the uprising, now in its third year, sheltering an estimated half a million refugees and allowing the opposition to organize on its soil.

But the booming illegal fuel trade has further destabilized the border zone in recent weeks, with the Turkish military exchanging fire with groups of smugglers trying to cross the frontier, sometimes numbering several thousand.

"They arrive in hundreds, sometimes thousands, so the army can't stop them," said Ismail, 36, a middleman selling jerry cans of smuggled fuel from his backyard in the village of Kusakli, which sits on the border.

"They don't need to hide. The soldiers know there is smuggling going on here," he said, breaking off to try to make a sale to the driver of a passing car.

Turkey has maintained an "open-door" policy to refugees from Syria, and officials in Ankara insist that will not change despite conceding there may be smugglers intermingled with the refugees. It has, nonetheless, been forced to tighten security.

The army said last week it had deployed armored vehicles and a tank along the frontier after spotting up to 1,000 people on foot, a separate group of 150 people on horseback, and some 40 vehicles forming a line along the border near Kusakli.

After rounds were fired from a pump action rifle among the crowd, soldiers returned fire, the latest in a series of such confrontations. [ID:nL4N0GG24Z]

However, it has yet to deter the illicit trade.

"Syrian rebels are doing this because they need the money. It's not even so much the money, they're hungry. Aid isn't really reaching them," said Hasan Cemiloglu, Kusakli's "muhtar", an elected local official.

"These guys end up pulling jerry cans at night through the border so that they can buy bread. Not because they are bad people," he told Reuters.

EARNING A LIVING

Villagers say the oil flows through a network of middlemen inside Syria, who all charge a fee for handling the safe passage of the cargo through their territory and usually bring it to the Bab al-Hawa or Tel Abyad border posts.

Mehmet, a middleman whose small truck can carry up to 50 jerry cans, shuttles back and forth from the border up to five times a night, picking up fuel and ferrying it to buyers in Kusakli on the Turkish side, where he can charge a premium.

Pricing depends on where the fuel is delivered. The average price per jerry can right at the border is around 80 lira ($40), but rises to 125 lira once shipped into town, where hundreds of jerry cans sit in the yards in front of almost every house.

"I think they will shut this down soon. It's become too obvious, everyone is doing it now ... People are making the most of it because they think it will be stopped," Mehmet said, declining to give his full name.

With its hilly terrain and thick vegetation, Hatay, the panhandle province that juts down into Syria in which Kusakli sits, makes a relatively easy crossing point for smugglers, as well as Syrian rebels and the refugees fleeing the fighting.

In another border village, Hacipasa, there is a similar scene. Backseats of cars are filled with jerry cans, clumsily covered with cloth, sometimes spilling fuel as they drive.

As violence has spilled over the border, Ankara has become increasingly concerned about the fallout of Syria's civil war and has periodically shut some of its border gates.

Twin bomb attacks in Reyhanli, the nearest main town, killed 52 people in April, while a Syrian minibus exploded at the nearby Cilvegozu border post in February, killing more than a dozen people.

But smuggling has long been part of life in the border regions and villagers who live off the illicit trade say neither the war, nor efforts to tighten security, will snuff it out.

"I have been doing this trade for years. After each bombing, it became more difficult. They closed one route, but people opened another," said Mehmet. "They had to."

graft campaigners.

The arrest of Xu Zhiyong, who has pushed for greater civil rights, could trigger an international outcry over Beijing's tightening grip of a fledgling movement. It also exposes shortcomings in the government's drive against corruption.

Western governments have sparred repeatedly with Beijing over human rights and the United States raised Xu's case this month during its annual rights dialogue with China.

Xu, the founder of the "New Citizens' Movement", advocates working within the system to press for change.

On the Internet, he has called on officials to disclose their assets and fellow activists have gone into the streets to urge citizens to combat corruption.

Beijing police arrested Xu on Thursday on a charge of "gathering a crowd to disturb order in a public place", one of Xu's lawyers, Zhang Qingfang, said by telephone.

Xu was detained last month on the same charge. Before that, he had been under house arrest for three months, with no reason given by the authorities. Xu had previously told Reuters that "it could be due to my campaign to push for asset disclosure".

Wang Gongquan, a venture capitalist and an old friend of Xu, said he was shocked at the arrest.

"What I'm shocked about is that the government and the police have gone farther and farther down the wrong road on the matter of Xu Zhiyong," he said.

"I feel sorry because there was an opportunity to release him before his arrest, but they are too overconfident and accustomed to doing their own thing regardless of right and wrong."

Police in Beijing could not be reached for comment.

China has detained at least 16 activists involved in pushing for asset disclosure by officials, in what rights groups say is a new, coordinated crackdown by the stability-obsessed ruling Communist Party against graft campaigners.

Xu's arrest coincided with the opening of the trial of former senior leader Bo Xilai on corruption charges, a case which has so far focused on Bo's alleged ill-gotten gains.

LAWYERS PRESS FOR ACTIVIST'S RELEASE

In China, a formal arrest usually leads to a trial, though Zhang said he was relatively confident that Xu could be released before the case comes to trial.

"I'm convincing Xu Zhiyong to express his views on social issues more rationally, in a more moderate way," Zhang said. "Xu has accepted this point."

Zhang said the lawyers were also trying to persuade authorities that litigating the case "is not necessarily the best way".

In a rare video-taped message from a detention center issued in early August, Xu, wearing handcuffs and an orange vest, urged the Chinese people to fight for their rights.

"Somebody has to pay for the society's progress, I am willing to bear all the costs for freedom, justice, love and faith," Xu said in his video.

In 2009, Xu was briefly arrested on tax evasion charges his defenders said were trumped up in a bid to stifle his work. The charges were dropped after a furor.



headline: U.N. combat brigade fires on Congo rebel positions
byline: By Kenny Katombe
7:26pm EDT

A new U.N. combat brigade formed to try to neutralize armed groups in Congo by force if needed fired artillery at M23 rebels menacing the eastern border city of Goma anew, U.N. and Congolese military officers said on Friday.

It was the brigade's first clash with M23 in support of government forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The U.N. force, composed of Tanzanian, South African and Malawian soldiers, was created by the U.N. Security Council in March.

Fighting entered a third successive day near Goma, a city of about a million people on the Rwandan border, after a relative lull in the 18-month-old M23 rebellion. Goma was briefly seized by the M23 last year and the United Nations pledged in July to prevent the rebels from getting back within range of the city.

But the rebels this week entered a security zone ringing Goma that had been established by the robustly-mandated U.N. Intervention Brigade earlier this month, and at least two people were killed when three shells landed in the city center.

U.N. Lieutenant-Colonel Felix Basse said another M23 shell crashed near Munigi on Goma's outskirts, where a U.N. peacekeepers' base is located, causing some civilian casualties.

"Of course we responded with artillery, as we cannot accept any threat to the population. That's why we retaliated," he told Reuters by telephone from Goma.

Clashes between M23 and the Congolese army continued early on Friday with government forces repelling two rebel assaults, according to Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the Congolese army, known as FARDC. "The (U.N.) brigade is engaged on our side, they're supporting us with their artillery," he said.

Basse could not confirm further brigade involvement in Friday's fighting.

An M23 spokesman did not confirm on Friday that they had been fired on by U.N. peacekeeping troops and said the group was trying to avoid direct clashes with them.

"It's not just the brigade we're trying to avoid fighting but the FARDC too ... If the army carries on attacking us we're going to defend ourselves," Amani Kabash said. "The army has got tanks and helicopters and they haven't pushed us back at all. That's why they're crying for MONUSCO to help."

A South African military spokesman said the country's troops in Congo had not clashed with M23. "The fight is taking place near where our troops are positioned. We have a defensive line but we have not engaged," Siphiwe Dlamini said.



headline: Turkey calls for action after Syria attack
byline: By Jonathon Burch
5:56pm EDT

Turkey urged the U.N. Security Council on Friday to take "concrete action" after a deadly attack in Syria in which it said chemical weapons had clearly been used.

Syria's opposition has accused government forces of gassing hundreds of people near Damascus by firing rockets that released deadly fumes over rebel-held suburbs. Damascus has dismissed the allegation.

"There is nothing left to say now regarding the events that are taking place in Syria, it is now time for actual concrete action," Turkish President Abdullah Gul told reporters in Istanbul on Friday.

"The price of playing down the events and procrastinating through diplomatic maneuvering and trickery in the U.N. Security Council will be very high."

In a live television interview late on Thursday, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said it was "very obvious" chemical weapons had been used in that attack.

"Some are still debating this, 'was it like this, was it like that?' What do you mean 'was it like this?' There are no bullets, no blood traces, no gunpowder, there is nothing. It is very obvious and clear, everything is evident," Erdogan said.

The United Nations stepped up demands on Syria for access to rebel-held Damascus suburbs hit by the apparent poison gas attack and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's opponents said they had sent tissue samples with couriers to try to get them to a U.N. inspection team in the country.

President Barack Obama stressed on Friday that he would not rush to embroil Americans in a costly new war.

Turkey, once an ally of Assad but now one of his fiercest critics, has long been concerned about the possible use of chemical weapons across its southern border and has repeatedly criticized the U.N. Security Council for inaction.

Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met his British and German counterparts in recent days to discuss the attack and telephoned Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in the hope that Tehran, an Assad ally, would lean on him to allow U.N. inspectors access to the site.



headline: China's Bo calls wife mad after she testifies against him
byline: By John Ruwitch
7:26pm EDT

Fallen Chinese politician Bo Xilai called his wife insane after she testified at his landmark trial on Friday that he knew of money and a villa in the French Riviera that prosecutors say were given to the couple by a businessman friend.

The video and written testimony by Gu Kailai directly contradicted Bo's robust defense on Thursday, and appear to set him up to be found guilty in China's most dramatic trial since the Gang of Four were dethroned in 1976 at the end of the Cultural Revolution.

"He should know about it all," Gu said in a video recording shown in court and posted on the court's microblog, when asked whether Bo knew that she and their son, Bo Guagua, had received money from plastics-to-property entrepreneur Xu Ming.

Bo dismissed Gu's testimony as the ravings of a madwoman.

"Bogu Kailai has changed, she's insane, often tells lies," Bo said, according to transcripts on the court microblog, using Gu's official but rarely used name. "Under the circumstances of her mental illness, the investigators placed huge pressure on her to expose me.

"Her testimony as far as I am concerned, was (given) under psychological pressure, and driven by (hope of) a reduced sentence," he added.

Gu has been jailed for the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in November 2011, the crime which eventually led to Bo's downfall.

The businessman Xu, who is also in custody, was once close to the Bo family, but also testified against him on Thursday, according to the transcripts. Foreign reporters were not allowed into the court.

Bo, the 64-year-old former Communist Party chief of Chongqing metropolis, has been charged with illegally taking almost 27 million yuan ($4.41 million), corruption and abuse of power. Of that amount, about 21.8 million yuan came from Xu and another businessman Tang Xiaolin, the court said, citing the indictment.

Bo was a rising star in China's leadership circles when his career was stopped short last year by the scandal involving Gu.

Supporters of Bo's Maoist-themed social programs say he lost out in a power struggle with capitalist-leaning reformists in Beijing, exposing divisions within the ruling party as well as Chinese society.

Last week, two sources told Reuters that Gu would only testify against her husband if a deal had been reached with authorities to protect their son.

A deal in which Bo can be swiftly convicted and sent to jail, sparing him a death penalty and with no repercussions for his son, would be in the interest of China's leadership, which wants the trial to be concluded without causing open friction between Bo's followers and critics.

On Thursday, observers said the court proceedings were probably scripted and that Bo could receive a pre-arranged sentence in exchange for limited outbursts that would show that the trial was fair, appeasing his followers.

The trial will continue for a third day on Saturday, the court said, despite expectations it could last just a single day.

VILLA IN NICE

In written testimony, Gu said she had shown Bo the graphics and slideshows for the design of a villa in Nice, France that was paid for by Xu. Bo asked her about the slideshows and according to Gu, she told Bo about Xu's involvement.

"Therefore he knew that I asked Xu Ming to pay for this villa in France," Gu said in her written statement.

In the poorly shot video, Gu appeared soft-spoken and composed as she was questioned by a worker from the state prosecutor's office. She laughed when asked whether she had been coerced into giving evidence.

Gu did not link Bo with Heywood's murder, but said he was aware she considered the Briton a threat to their son. According to testimony at Gu's trial, she killed Heywood because he had threatened Guagua after a business dispute with Gu.

Gu said Bo was also aware of her fears about the safety of Guagua, who is now in the United States preparing for a law degree at Columbia University. Gu said she was afraid Guagua "would be kidnapped and killed in America".

"In 2011, Guagua's personal safety was threatened and Bo Xilai understood this," she said in her written testimony.

"We drew up a blacklist of suspicious people. One of them was Neil Heywood. I explained all of this to Bo Xilai."

Bo could face the death sentence, though a suspended death sentence is more likely, which effectively means life imprisonment, or a 20-year term.

season debate about how the country treats asylum seekers.

"We are of course very much interested, not in the election itself, but in the debate about asylum policy in Australia," said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres.

Opinion polls predict the government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's Labor Party will be unseated by the conservative coalition led by Tony Abbot when Australians vote on September 7.

In a pitch to voters concerned about immigration, Abbott promised last week to revive tough laws barring thousands of asylum seekers already in Australia from settling there permanently.

"The debate about these questions, not only in Australia but in many other parts of the world, is unfortunately not always based only on realities. It's based on perceptions, on prejudice, on other aspects," Guterres told Reuters.

"But we hope that in the end common sense will prevail."

Abbot has said he would appoint a military commander to take charge of asylum issues in an operation dubbed "sovereign borders", and would give the 30,000 asylum seekers in Australia only temporary protection visas if they were found to be refugees, meaning they could be sent to their home country in the future.

Australia had always been generous about resettling refugees and has one of the most successful programs to integrate resettled refugees anywhere in the world, Guterres said.

"I hope... Australia understands also the need to provide protection to those that seek protection in Australia," he said.

Rudd's government was recently rapped by a U.N. human rights watchdog for mistreating a group of 46 refugees, including 42 Tamils from Sri Lanka, after judging them to be a potential security risk.

A U.N. committee that monitors compliance with a major human rights treaty ruled in July that Australia must compensate, release and rehabilitate the refugees, according to a statement from the U.N. human rights office on Thursday.

headline: Leading activist says Egypt revolution back at square one
byline: By Tom Perry
7:26pm EDT

Ahmed Maher's April 6 movement helped lead the uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak in 2011. With Mubarak now out of jail, he says the revolution is back to square one, and could take a generation to prevail.

After the bloodiest week in Egypt's modern history, Maher fears the consequences of the hatred that has split the country into two rival camps: the army-led state and its backers, and the Islamists they removed from power on July 3.

"Our problem is there is a wave of madness. People tell you: 'We must eradicate them'," Maher said, saying such attitudes had emerged on both sides. "There must be a third voice."

The assessment from one of Egypt's best-known activists underlines the bleak outlook for the country whose January 25, 2011, uprising inspired pro-democracy revolts across the Arab world.

Maher, 32, says it may now be another generation before the goals of the revolution - freedom, social justice and dignity - are secured.

He spoke at a rundown Cairo office where the walls were covered with stickers bearing witness to non-stop activism since 2011: campaigns first against the generals who replaced Mubarak, and later against the elected Muslim Brotherhood-led government.

Protest work itself is becoming a victim of the latest bloodshed: April 6 canceled a rally on Friday against Mubarak's release out of fears it might lead to violence.

"We view ourselves back at square one, because what is happening now could be more dangerous, more complicated than what was there before January 25, 2011," Maher said.

"We don't fully understand what is happening in the new regime," he said. "There are fears of the return of the old regime, its people and methods."

"There are also extremist, radical armed groups."

Maher's April 6 was one of the youth movements that galvanized Egyptians during the 18-day uprising that ended when the army forced Mubarak aside on February 11, 2011.

But like most secular groups, it failed to make much of a political mark once Mubarak was toppled - a failure that helped the Islamists win election after election, culminating with last year's presidential vote that brought Mohamed Mursi to power.

April 6 backed Mursi in that vote, but later turned its countrywide activist network against him, echoing critics who said his Muslim Brotherhood was seeking to entrench its power even as it failed in government.

It gathered 2 million signatures for the Tamarod petition campaign that helped to mobilize protests against Mursi.

"When the army came to power after January 25, the alternative was the Brotherhood. Then the Brotherhood came, and the alternative was the military," he said. "The problem was the two-sided equation from the start. There must be a real alternative."

DIFFICULT TO SPEAK OUT

The Brotherhood is now facing one of the toughest crackdowns in its 85-year history.

Since Mursi's downfall, the security forces have killed at least 1,000 of his supporters, most of them last week when the police used force to break up their two Cairo protest camps.

Some 100 soldiers and police were also killed in bloodshed that has raised fears that an armed Islamist insurrection could ensue, even as the Brotherhood continues to disavow violence.

The police are arresting Brotherhood leaders and supporters across the country. State media say Egypt is fighting terrorism.

Maher said public hatred of the Brotherhood was now running so deep that it was difficult for activists to speak out about worrying trends such as the re-imposition of a state of emergency. "Everyone is directed towards the idea of the 'war on terror', and if there are violations, they are being ignored."

Mubarak's release on Thursday was a symbolic victory for supporters of the veteran autocrat. Though he is being retried for ordering the killing of protesters in the 2011 uprising, there are no longer any legal grounds for his detention.

"Naturally, there are fears, especially after the release of Mubarak," Maher said. "But as a revolution, we knew at the start there could be many setbacks ... We were expecting difficulties. But nobody thought it would be this complicated."

"I should be depressed, and I am depressed, but I still have hope, even with these complications, the violence, these fears. I still have confidence that one day we will see a new Egypt," he said. "My generation might not see these changes. We might be paving the way for the new generation to see these changes."

long disabilities and health problems for which there are few effective treatments.

The death toll from the incident, the latest grisly episode in Syria's two-and-a-half-year civil war, could well rise in coming days as doctors and other health workers who suffered secondary exposure via the direct victims start to succumb to the agent's poison.

Antidotes and emergency treatments do exist for patients suffering the immediate effects of poisoning by a nerve agent - something many experts fear happened to the thousands affected in rebel-held areas of the Syrian capital on Wednesday.

But if no help comes within the first hour or so, the chances become slim that an antidote drug like atropine or oxime, or the sedative diazepam, will do much good.

"(Treatment) needs to be immediate. The damage is done very quickly," said Ray Zilinskas, a chemical and biological weapons expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in the United States.

"Longer term, the major risk is the result of significant restricted breathing," which could also lead to brain damage, said Alastair Hay, a professor of environmental toxicology and chemical weapons expert at Britain's Leeds University.

ONE BREATH COULD BE DEADLY

Nerve gases are the most potent and deadly of the known chemical agents. "They are rapidly lethal and are hazardous by any route of exposure," says Sharon Ruetter of the U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center in Maryland.

In a review of chemical weapons hazards in the Environmental Health Perspectives journal, Ruetter said it was theoretically possible to release nerve gases in high enough concentrations that "one breath would be incapacitating or deadly".

Nerve gases include tabun, soman and sarin - the agent experts think is most likely to have been used in Syria.

They interfere with transmissions between nerves, or between nerves and muscle cells, causing muscle weakness or paralysis, including paralysis of the diaphragm and heart. They also cause seizures, loss of body control, restricted breathing, sweating, profuse nasal and lung secretions and constricted pupils.

"With the number of casualties we've seen - the figures I'm seeing at the moment are up to 2,000 dead - and the sorts of symptoms, the rapidity of death ... the only plausible explanation is a chemical weapon," said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the former commander of the chemical, biological and nuclear counter-terrorism unit at Britain's defense ministry.

"If it is a chemical weapon, it's most likely to be a nerve agent - and we know that sarin has been used in the past in Syria. We know that Assad has very large stockpiles of sarin, and a delivery of sarin would create these kinds of casualties."

Hay said that from pictures and videos he'd seen, nasal and lung secretions - signs consistent with nerve gas poisoning - were "very evident in many of the victims".

ANTIDOTE STOCKPILES?

Then there's the question of whether the antidote is available - and if so, in what quantities.

If the victims - whose writhing bodies and agonized faces shocked the world when Syrian activists published pictures and videos - did suffer a nerve agent attack, then atropine would be the treatment of choice.

A generic medicine, it is used in anesthesia as a premedication, in emergency situations or during surgery to make the heart beat faster, and to reverse the effects of poisons that make people hyper-salivate, or foam at the mouth.

Troops at risk of chemical weapons attacks often carry atropine auto-injectors to administer into thigh muscles.

Since it is a core medicine on the World Health Organization's "Essential Drugs List" - a list of minimum medical needs for any basic healthcare system - hospitals in Syria should have it, but may not have enough to treat a large number of people quickly.

"We have emergency (atropine) stockpiles here in the United States that could be accessed in a short time - and most industrialized countries would be the same," said Zilinskas.

In Syria, while most hospitals should have small amounts when they are functioning properly, the fear now is that supplies will be severely limited, and that any stockpiles are most likely to be held by the military.

"The question is how quickly would the military share? How quickly would they get it to victims?" said Zilinskas. "It doesn't do much good if it arrives two or three hours later."



headline: Tunisian opposition demands Islamist government quit
byline: By Tarek Amara
3:59pm EDT

Tunisia's secular opposition said on Friday that the governing Islamists must quit power before they would join negotiations to resolve the country's worst crisis since its Arab Spring revolt, declaring otherwise the talks would be a waste of time.

Opposition leaders said an agreement in principle by the Islamist party Ennahda on Thursday to start talks soon with the mediation of the country's powerful UGTT trade union federation was only a government attempt to buy time.

Commentators said Ennahda's apparent concessions this week kindled hope that Tunisia, the birthplace two-and-a-half years ago of the Arab Spring revolts, might find a consensus to save its nascent democracy rather than see it collapse as in Egypt.

However, as rival parties squabbled over the UGTT offer to mediate, opposition groups went ahead with plans for a large rally on Saturday outside the country's constituent assembly in Tunis to pressure the Islamist-led government to quit.

"Any negotiation without the immediate dissolution of the government would be a waste of time," Taieb Baccouche, secretary general of the main opposition party Nida Tounes, said after meeting UGTT chief Hussein Abassi.

Samir Bettaib, a leader in the "Salvation Front" grouping of several opposition groups, said: "Ennahda continues to maneuver ... the only initiative we accept is the announcement to dissolve the government immediately."

Abassi, whose million-strong Tunisian General Labor Union gives him a central role in pressuring the two sides towards consensus, was due to hold another meeting with Ennahda chairman Rached Ghannouchi later on Friday.

RAY OF HOPE?

The current crisis began late last month after the second assassination of a leftist leader this year by suspected Islamist radicals outraged secular groups already opposed to what they called Ennahda's religious agenda, mismanagement of the economy and failure to assure law and order.

Emboldened by the protests that led to the army ouster of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Mursi, Tunisian opposition groups stepped up demands for Ennahda to quit.

Ghannouchi announced on Thursday his agreement in principle to meet opposition leaders to discuss the UGTT's proposal that the Ennahda-led government resigns and a technocrat cabinet steps in to organize parliamentary elections.

However, opposition parties insist Ennahda quit before any talks, saying they do not trust it to hold the free and fair poll due at the end of the stalled work on a new constitution, which may be quickly finished if the parties can agree to resolve the crisis.

Ghannouchi, the key player on the Islamist side although he has no official role in the government, has been offering concessions that could pave the way to a caretaker cabinet without appearing to be a defeat for his party Ennahda.

But commentators say it is not clear this will lead to a solution, especially if other factors such as rising popular discontent get out of hand or the two sides cannot agree.

"It's too early for a final verdict, but the evolution of the situation gives a ray of hope for a calming down and a quick end to the standoff," the daily Le Temps wrote.

Although Egypt and Tunisia are both in turmoil over the role of Islamists in their post-revolutionary governments, analysts in Tunisia rule out a Cairo-style military takeover in the small country in North Africa of 11 million people.

Unlike its Egyptian counterpart, the Tunisian army has no tradition of interfering in politics.



headline: Rebels smuggling Syria chemical weapons strike evidence to U.N. experts
byline: By Erika Solomon
6:20pm EDT

Syrian activists say they are smuggling out body tissue samples from victims of an alleged chemical weapons attack outside Damascus and are trying to get them to a team of United Nations inspectors staying in a hotel a few miles away.

"The U.N. team spoke with us and since then we prepared samples of hair, skin and blood and smuggled them back into Damascus with trusted couriers," said activist Abu Nidal, speaking from the town of Arbin.

Some activists worry their efforts could be for naught - with little equipment and under constant shelling it hard for them to prove their evidence has not be tampered with or damaged before it reaches U.N. experts.

The opposition accuses President Bashar al-Assad's forces of firing rockets before dawn on Wednesday loaded which poison gas in the midst of a fierce offensive on the rebel-held suburbs that ring the capital.

The army has been pummeling the area, known as the Ghouta region, since Tuesday night with air raids and artillery strikes that could hinder access to the sites and potentially damage evidence. Chemical weapons experts say every hour counts - the longer it takes, the more likely evidence can be covered up or tampered with.

Only a few activists said they were confident that they had a contact who would be able to hand their samples to the U.N. inspectors.

Most activists in the area who spoke to Reuters said they had also prepared samples to smuggle into the capital, but had little to zero contact with the U.N. experts and were unable to find a way to access the monitors inside their hotel.

"We're being shelled and on top of that Ghouta is surrounded by regime checkpoints. But even that isn't a problem, we can smuggle them out," said activist Abo Mohammed, from the suburb of Harasta.

"The problem is the location of the U.N. committee in the hotel. They're under heavy guard and government minders."

"CONFIDENTIAL DESTINATION"

Opposition sources say that in addition to tissue samples they have taken photographs of bomb sites, written witness accounts, and samples of soil and animals in areas affected by the attacks.

An activist in Damascus who calls herself Alexia Jade confirmed that medics and activists in the suburbs have been trying to get samples out of the suburbs and were sending them to a secret location. She hinted there may be several organizations that the opposition would try to deliver the samples to, but would not give further details.

and there may be more than one destination. The plan is to get the samples to someone who can actually do something about," she told Reuters on Skype.

Some medical centers in eastern Ghouta placed notices on Facebook calling on all doctors and medics that treated victims of the alleged attack to send tissue samples and reports to a centralized opposition medical center in the area in order to prepare them for use.

It asked for activists to maintain confidentiality as they prepared the reports.

Syria's uprising against four decades of Assad family rule has turned into a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people.

Foreign powers have said chemical weapons could change the calculus in terms of outside intervention and have negotiated with Damascus to allow a U.N. team of experts to examine the site of three small-scale attacks where poison gas was allegedly used earlier this year.

WASTED EFFORT

The United Nations is now seeking to expand the group's mandate to allow them to investigate the most recent attack, whose death toll ranges from 500 to more than 1,000 people.

Syria has given no response to the demands. On Wednesday it denied using chemical weapons, calling the claims "illogical and fabricated."

Many activists in Ghouta said that while they were helping to collect samples, they were not hopeful their efforts would lead to any results from the United Nations.

"The last time we sent them evidence we had to smuggle it all the way north through Syria up to Turkey. And when investigators got it, they said the evidence could have been tampered with and was therefore not totally credible," said activist Abu Nidal.

"We have very little faith that the U.N. or the world will do anything for us no matter how hard we try to meet their demands. I personally think its time to let the rebels handle this on their own."

Pansy Ho, Hong Kong's richest woman and the daughter of Macau gambling godfather Stanley Ho, is lining up her chips for a new era in the world's casino capital that promises much more than gambling.

Born into a family that developed a flourishing gambling culture in the southern Chinese territory more than 50 years ago, Ho is now a key player spearheading a move to diversify Macau into an arts, culture and entertainment hub, and away from the gaudy casino halls which raked in $38 billion last year.

Co-chair of U.S. casino MGM China and managing director of property to transport conglomerate Shun Tak, Ho is positioning her sprawling business empire to capitalize on Macau's new generation of growth, boosted by the influx of affluent Chinese holiday makers.

"Macau has become an entirely different destination," the petite 50-year-old said in an interview at one of her several offices in Hong Kong's financial district, adamant that the world's casino capital can't rely just on gaming to fuel growth.

About a third the size of Manhattan, Macau is the only place in China where casinos are allowed, and it relies on casino taxes for more than 80 percent of its revenue. Beijing, which can control visitor numbers entering the former Portuguese colony, has made Macau's transformation into a global tourism destination part of its current 5-year plan.

"This is exactly where my job leads me in the future," said Ho, with neatly cropped black hair and dressed in a maroon collared blouse. Apart from her business interests, Ho sits on several political committees in China and the Macau government's tourism development committee.

Art galleries, music festivals, cultural shows and theatre are some of the initiatives Ho plans to bring to Macau. She is also positioning Shun Tak in hotel management, aviation and property, further expanding the family business's extensive footprint in the Pearl River Delta.

BIG CHANGES

One of 17 children of Stanley Ho's four wives, Pansy Ho has emerged as the most prominent heir to her 91-year-old father's empire. As the sole license holder in Macau for more than four decades, Stanley Ho's influence has reigned strong through casino company SJM Holdings, which operates more than half of Macau's casinos, and privately-held STDM, which has investments in gaming, aviation, retail and property.

While Pansy is not involved in SJM, she has a strategic role at MGM and is in charge at Shun Tak, which her father established as a small ferry operator in the 1970s. Since joining Shun Tak over 15 years ago, she has helped grow it into a sprawling conglomerate worth HK$11 billion ($1.42 billion).

Forbes estimates Ho's net worth at $4.4 billion.

Educated at a Catholic girls' school in Hong Kong, Ho says she never intended to work in the family business. Passionate about the arts from a young age, particularly the stage and musicals, she was keen to study literature and drama at Vassar College in the United States, but her father disapproved.

"He said in this age and time, why would you want to take up something so passive?" she recalls, smiling.

Ho instead opted to study marketing and international business management at the University of Santa Clara in California before returning to Hong Kong where she ran her mother's jewelry company, did charity work and set up her own PR company, Occasions, which still operates today.

Ho was appointed managing director of Shun Tak during Macau's handover to China in 1999 and prior to the liberalization of the gaming industry, so she has seen first-hand how the market has been radically transformed.

"It was very much the local, traditional style, which is really just a lot of gaming parlors ... Now, throughout the past decade, because of the opening up of the market and the introduction of new operators, we all vie to get our own positioning and our own edge," she said.

Prior to the build-up of opulent multi-billion dollar resorts by the likes of Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts, Macau's casinos tended to be dark and dingy with few shopping or fine dining options.

The difference today is stark, says Pansy, noting that 10 years ago Macau had only one short street of high-end stores compared to hundreds of luxury outlets today. One Central, an up-market shopping arcade adjacent to MGM Macau, is testament to the change, with stores such as Louis Vuitton among the brand's largest in the world.

Alongside the growth of retail, Ho is betting on a long-term vision of integrated transport infrastructure in southern China. In June, Shun Tak paid $66 million for a one-third stake in budget carrier Jetstar. And last month, Shun Tak, which has one of the largest land banks in Macau and the biggest fleet of high-speed ferries in Asia, launched Artyzen Hospitality Group, a company focused on developing luxury hotel brands in China and internationally.

"We should be able to hit 12-15 ... properties under our management in three years," Ho said.

IN THE BLOOD

Ho, whose siblings include Lawrence Ho, co-chairman of Melco Crown Entertainment, a joint casino venture with Australian billionaire James Packer, has a reputation as a shrewd business executive, not unlike her father, who dabbled in trading, kerosene and construction, befriending the Portuguese and Hong Kong governments, prior to making his casino fortune.

Ho says she is tough and pragmatic.

"I almost always have a strong passion about the things I do. I wouldn't say aggressive, but I am always trying very hard to make sure that things will succeed," she said.

Ho says she still discusses business with her father, who has withdrawn from the day-to-day running of the family business, and benefits from his experience, "especially on the relationship side of things".

"We all respect Dr Ho's vision and this is still very much a core driving initiative for all of us. We really strongly believe in the future development of Macau and how it rests on ingenuity. This is what he brought to Macau 50 years ago and we need to continue to push the envelope."



headline: U.N. combat brigade fires on Congo rebel positions
byline: By Jonny Hogg
7:26pm EDT

A new U.N. combat brigade formed to try to neutralize armed groups in Congo by force if needed fired artillery at M23 rebels menacing the eastern border city of Goma anew, U.N. and Congolese military officers said on Friday.

It was the brigade's first clash with M23 in support of government forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The U.N. force, composed of Tanzanian, South African and Malawian soldiers, was created by the U.N. Security Council in March.

Fighting entered a third successive day near Goma, a city of about a million people on the Rwandan border, after a relative lull in the 18-month-old M23 rebellion. Goma was briefly seized by the M23 last year and the United Nations pledged in July to prevent the rebels from getting back within range of the city.

But the rebels this week entered a security zone ringing Goma that had been established by the robustly-mandated U.N. Intervention Brigade earlier this month, and at least two people were killed when three shells landed in the city center.

U.N. Lieutenant-Colonel Felix Basse said another M23 shell crashed near Munigi on Goma's outskirts, where a U.N. peacekeepers' base is located, causing some civilian casualties.

"Of course we responded with artillery, as we cannot accept any threat to the population. That's why we retaliated," he told Reuters by telephone from Goma.

Clashes between M23 and the Congolese army continued early on Friday with government forces repelling two rebel assaults, according to Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the Congolese army, known as FARDC. "The (U.N.) brigade is engaged on our side, they're supporting us with their artillery," he said.

Basse could not confirm further brigade involvement in Friday's fighting.

An M23 spokesman did not confirm on Friday that they had been fired on by U.N. peacekeeping troops and said the group was trying to avoid direct clashes with them.

"It's not just the brigade we're trying to avoid fighting but the FARDC too ... If the army carries on attacking us we're going to defend ourselves," Amani Kabash said. "The army has got tanks and helicopters and they haven't pushed us back at all. That's why they're crying for MONUSCO to help."

A South African military spokesman said the country's troops in Congo had not clashed with M23. "The fight is taking place near where our troops are positioned. We have a defensive line but we have not engaged," Siphiwe Dlamini said.

headline: Syria government, rebels ramp up conventional weapons use
byline: By Peter Apps
7:26pm EDT

Syria's warring sides might have struggled to get the foreign arms they want, but even before this week's apparent chemical attack both government and opposition were using ever more powerful conventional weapons.

On Wednesday, opposition forces accused the government of President Bashar al-Assad of killing hundreds with a nerve gas attack in the suburbs of the capital Damascus.

The government of Bashar al-Assad denied the charge, but with international condemnation mounting, analysts said it was becoming ever more likely that western states and their Gulf allies would finally get on with seriously arming the rebels.

What is certain, activists and analysts say, is that recent months have seen a move towards larger weapons, from bunker-busting bombs being used by Syria's air force to increased rebel use of captured tanks, artillery and rockets.

For now, there are few if any signs that high-profile talk of weapons supplies from Western and Gulf states to the rebels and from Russia to Assad have been followed through in anything like the quantities needed to shift the balance.

"Outsiders - both the West and the Russians - have been holding back," says David Hartwell, a former British Ministry of Defense official now Middle East analyst for IHS Jane's. "But in reality that may not matter as there are plenty of weapons within Syria, and the more jihadist opposition elements in particular seem to be really upping their game and using them."

Earlier this month, opposition fighters widely believed to include Al Qaeda-linked elements captured a major military air base at Mannagh near the border with Turkey. They also pushed deeper into the Assad government's ethnic Alawite heartland of Latakia.

While there is no sign the rebels have the capability to operate the government attack helicopters they claimed to have captured at Mannagh, analysts say online videos have shown them increasingly using T-54 and T-62 Soviet-built tanks.

The Free Syrian Army - as well as the Al-Qaeda affiliated al-Nusra Front and other groups - have also been using increasingly potent captured artillery. This has included Grad surface-to-surface rockets analysts say were vital to the Islamist-led push into Latakia.

FOREIGNERS HOLD BACK

As with militants in Iraq and Afghanistan, rebel fighters in Syria appeared to have become increasingly adept at designing their own weapons. One set of online videos shows rebel commanders showing off their "Hell Cannon", a 4-metre long rocket said to be capable of delivering 120 kg of high explosive more than 3 kilometers (1.9 miles).

One image showed one such launcher apparently built into an industrial digger, perhaps for stability. ( <a href="http://brown-moses.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/diy-weapons-in-syria-syrian-opposition.html">here</a> )

Pictures from within Syria also suggest Assad's allies Hezbollah are also improvising their own systems, increasing the payload capacity to make their basic handheld rockets carry more explosive.

Some foreign weaponry has continued to slip in, with ongoing reports of Chinese-manufactured handheld anti-tank and anti-aircraft rockets widely suspected to have been bought by Qatar, possibly from Sudan, for delivery to Islamist fighters.

Saudi Arabia has also provided some weapons, experts and foreign officials say. But long-touted shipments of military aid from Britain, France and the United States have never arrived.

When the White House announced in June that chemical weapons usage by Assad's forces had changed the strategic equation and that it would supply military support, officials suggested the first major shipment would arrive in August.

In reality, however, decisions were delayed by a lack of agreement in Congress. Even with some Congressional roadblocks now cleared, U.S. and other foreign officials see a growing reluctance to follow through on the talk, particularly as Islamist influence in the anti-Assad forces continues to grow.

As Western, Russian, regional and UN officials tried to tiptoe ever closer to some kind of Geneva-based peace talks, Moscow too appears to have held back on some of its more serious weaponry offers to the Assad government.

Foreign officials and analysts say there has so far been no sign of Russia moving to deliver on its offer of sophisticated S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. That offer, many analysts believe, was largely designed to block any suggestion that the West might impose a Libya-style no-fly zone.

With the likelihood of such action now seen much reduced - although that could change in the aftermath of Wednesday's reported chemical strike - Assad's air force now appears to have abandoned any thoughts of holding back its heavier weaponry.

BUNKER BUSTERS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES

Most analysts believe Assad has probably received some new supplies of basic ammunition and artillery shells, possibly from Russia and almost certainly from Iran. In general, however, he is believed to be still largely relying on Syria's pre-war stockpiles.

Eliot Higgins, a UK-based blogger with the pseudonym "Brown Moses" who has emerged as an unexpected and largely self-taught expert on weaponry in Syria, says videos posted online after air raids show ever heavier weaponry being used.

"It's been going on for a while," says Higgins, whose work has been praised and used by rights groups such as Amnesty International. "We've been seeing some cluster munitions and incendiaries used since late last year. Now they seem to be using almost everything they have got, even if it's not always that effective."

Recent months, he says, have seen the first appearances of the S-25, an air-to-surface missile, and the also Soviet-built AS-14 Kedge, designed to penetrate military bunkers and perhaps used to target rebel tunnels and cellars.

Improved rebel anti-aircraft capability may also be forcing a change in tactics. As well as truck-mounted heavy machine guns, the rebels have also increasingly been seen with foreign-supplied Chinese-made FN-6 handheld MANPAD portable missiles.

Last month, Liwa al-Islam - one of the groups operating outside the Free Syrian Army - published a video purporting to show it operating the most sophisticated rebel anti-aircraft weaponry yet. The footage appeared to show the interior of a 9K33 Osa surface-to-air missile battery apparently captured from the government.

"A lot of this is about propaganda," said Afshon Ostovar, Middle East analyst at the Centre for Naval Analyses near Washington DC. "We don't know if they know how to use it. We don't even know if they have the missiles."

founded.

Tusk's Civic Platform (PO) has trailed the main right-wing opposition party in most recent polls with a rising number of Poles unhappy over his handling of the economy, which earlier this year barely escaped its first recession in two decades.

The party has also suffered at the ballot box in local elections. Last month, PO lost an election for mayor of the city of Elblag, near Poland's Baltic Sea coast, that had been one of its strongholds. The party's deputy head, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, could be sacked as mayor of Warsaw in a vote in October.

Tusk was challenged by his former justice minister, Jaroslaw Gowin, who was fired in April after the two clashed over issues such as in vitro fertilization and civil partnerships for gay couples.

The party said on Friday Tusk won 79.6 percent of the votes cast by party members, his fourth straight victory in a leadership contest. Gowin took the remaining 20.4 percent.

But with turnout at just 51 percent, the vote was hardly the ringing endorsement Tusk had been hoping for.

Most observers had expected Tusk, who has maintained an iron grip on his party since ousting two other co-founders soon after it was launched in 2001, to win by an even wider margin.

"More than 20 percent for Gowin is a strong signal," said sociologist Andrzej Rychard. "A large part of his support is a reflection of dissatisfaction with Tusk."

Tusk had moved up the leadership election by nearly a year to quash internal bickering, which also came from the centrist wing led by former ally Grzegorz Schetyna, who decided not to challenge the prime minister.

Tusk congratulated Gowin for his "quite a good result" and asked party members to drop a motion to expel his former minister from the party for not backing a budget vote last month with two others.

Poland is not scheduled to hold a general election until late 2015, but the Civic Platform will face a strong opposition in next year's polls to pick local officials and representatives in the European Union parliament.

going tourists.

More than two dozen foreign airlines operate regular flights from Asia and the Middle East to Nepal, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest. Six airlines fly wide-body planes into the capital, Kathmandu.

Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, head of the state-owned Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, said a request had been sent to all foreign airlines to switch to narrow-body aircraft or to reduce payloads as authorities filled the holes.

It was not immediately clear how long it would take to eliminate the potholes, discovered last week.

The airline industry said the request was not mandatory and would be difficult to comply with.

"It is not a binding order to the airlines," said Saroj Kumar Kasaju, chairman of the Board of Airlines Representatives Nepal, a body of airlines operating flights to Kathmandu.

He said airlines had already booked passengers and issued tickets as the peak tourism season begins in September. "It will, therefore, be difficult to off-load passengers now," Kasaju said.

Tourism accounts for some 30 percent of foreign currency earnings.

Kathmandu sits in a bowl surrounded by forested, rugged hills. Its airport is known as a tricky landing spot requiring a steep descent.

A propeller-driven Dornier aircraft, headed to Lukla, the gateway to Mount Everest, crashed minutes after take off from Kathmandu last September, killing 19 people and highlighting concerns about air safety.

Cambodian staff at a Khmer Rouge war crimes tribunal renewed threats to go on strike amid a deepening funding crisis at a court already bogged down by resignations and the ill health of its elderly defendants.

Some 250 Cambodians have not been paid since June and July at the U.N.-backed court and around 100 staff planned to strike on September 1, caught up in a standoff between donors and a government criticized for its lack of support for hearings into one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century.

The funding dispute puts the spotlight on the commitment of the government, which has been accused of interfering behind the scenes to put the brakes on the court and limit the scope of investigations that could implicate powerful political figures.

Between 1.7 million and 2.2 million people, almost a quarter of Cambodia's population, died between 1975 and 1979 under the ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge, many of them from overwork and torture.

"A total of around 100 staff planned to boycott their work from September 1, 2013, if any solution will not be found related to their delayed salaries," said a court spokesman, Neth Pheaktra. "Some of them started to suspend their jobs since mid August and take their time to find other jobs."

The court, dogged from the outset by allegations of corruption, political interference and profligacy, had spent $175.3 million by the end of last year and handed down just one conviction - that of former prison chief Kaing Guek Eav, alias "Duch", who was jailed for life for the deaths of more than 14,000 people.

The European Union, who had called on Cambodia to come up with more cash for the tribunal, pledged $4 million this week, but that will only go to pay salaries of the international staff at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC).

"This new contribution to the ECCC, the first to its international component, is a renewed proof of the commitment of the European Union to deliver justice for the Cambodian People," said EU Ambassador Jean-Franรงois Cautain in a statement.

Under the agreement for the tribunal, the U.N. was to pay for international staff and operations, while Cambodia paid for the national side, but the government has been repeatedly criticised for its lack of support.

7:26pm EDT

The head of the U.N. mission in Congo on Thursday ordered peacekeeping troops to act to protect civilians after shelling hit the city of Goma in renewed fighting between the army and M23 rebels.

The fighting close to Goma, a city of a million people on the Rwandan border, comes after a relative lull in the 18-month rebellion. Late last month, the United Nations pledged to keep the M23 rebels out of range of the town, which they briefly seized last year.

Rwanda, which has long had strained relations with its neighbor, accused the Congolese army of deliberately firing artillery into its territory. Kinshasa denied the reports and repeated its accusation that Rwanda backs M23. Rwanda denies it.

Martin Kobler, head of the U.N. mission known as MONUSCO, said populated areas and U.N. positions had been directly attacked during the clashes on Thursday.

"I have ordered the MONUSCO Force to react and to take necessary action to protect civilians and prevent an advance by the M23," he said, without elaborating.

A Reuters reporter in Goma said three shells landed in the town and saw the bodies of two children killed in one of the explosions. Another civilian was killed and four others wounded, officials at a local hospital said. Two Congolese soldiers were also wounded, they said.

Fighting initially broke out late on Wednesday.

A senior U.N. official, who asked not to be named, said that on Thursday the rebels entered a security zone surrounding Goma, which was established by a new, robustly-mandated U.N. Intervention Brigade earlier this month.

The official said M23 had fired the shells that fell on Goma and across the border in Rwanda.

RWANDA BLAMES CONGO ARMY

Rwanda's defense ministry acknowledged a rocket had hit the Rwandan border village of Buga but blamed it on the Congolese army, calling it "completely unprovoked and senseless".

No casualties were reported in Rwanda, but the ministry said the explosion had damaged property.

In New York, deputy U.N. peacekeeping chief Edmond Mulet asked the U.N. Security Council to condemn M23's attacks, diplomats told Reuters on condition of anonymity. France drafted a council statement that would have "condemned in the strongest terms the attacks by M23 rebel group against civilians" and M23's attacks on MONUSCO, according to a draft seen by Reuters.

But the delegation of Rwanda, currently a council member, objected to that wording and proposed an amended text, also seen by Reuters, that would condemn both the Congolese FARDC army and M23 and urge the "FARDC and M23 to cease violence immediately."

Rwanda also proposed deleting language noting that targeting peacekeepers is a war crime. Rwanda was the sole member of the 15-nation council that objected to the French-drafted statement, envoys said.

Two Western diplomats said the Rwandan amendments were an attempt to equate the Congolese army with the M23 rebels and therefore unacceptable.

The rebels rejected accusations they were behind Thursday's shelling, saying it was done by Congolese soldiers in an attempt to draw peacekeepers and Rwandan troops into the fight.

"We want the (Congolese army) removed from Goma and for it to be protected by the neutral forces of MONUSCO and the police. We have no intention of entering Goma," M23 spokesman Amani Kabasha said. "We are waiting for negotiations to start."

The M23 rebels began taking large swathes of Congo's volatile east early last year, accusing the central government of failing to honor a previous peace deal.

They dealt a serious blow to the image of MONUSCO - at 17,000 troops the world's largest U.N. mission - last November by marching past U.N. soldiers to briefly seize Goma.

They withdrew under a deal that called for peace negotiations between the rebels and Congolese government representatives. However the talks in the Ugandan capital Kampala have made little headway.

The 3,000-member U.N. Intervention Brigade - made up of South African, Tanzanian and Malawian troops - was established in the wake of Goma's seizure by M23 and is tasked with fighting and disarming rebel groups in Congo's volatile east.

MONUSCO said last month the new security zone established by the Intervention Brigade would keep Goma beyond the range of M23 and said the city would not come under attack again.

headline: China makes big show of Bo trial, but it's still just theatre

7:26pm EDT

With detailed online transcripts carried by China's version of Twitter, Beijing is making an unprecedented effort to show its people that the trial of ousted politician Bo Xilai is fair and above board, but the court case is little more than theatre.

Never before has the stability and unity-obsessed ruling Communist Party allowed the gritty and colorful details of such a sensitive trial to be publicized almost real-time to the population at large.

None of this means, however, that China has turned a corner in efforts to push the rule of law and official transparency.

Bo, the 64-year-old former party chief of the southwestern city of Chongqing, has been charged with illegally taking almost 27 million yuan ($4.41 million), corruption and abuse of power and will almost certainly be found guilty in China's most political trial in decades.

The party is almost certainly preventing any really embarrassing outbursts from Bo from appearing, has banned the world's media from the courtroom and is certainly not broadcasting it live on national television.

Even the "Gang of Four" trial Mao Zedong's wife Jiang Qing in 1980 for crimes committed during the Cultural Revolution, previously the country's most dramatic case, was only shown in part on state television.

Jiang was removed from the courtroom several times after shouting down judges and insulting witnesses - a scene the party would never want to risk the whole country seeing with Bo.

The party is simply hoodwinking people with its use of the court microblog, Jiang's former defense lawyer, Zhang Sizhi, told Reuters.

"Making a microblog public is just their ruse, it's meaningless," Zhang said.

"Because if you can post microblogs, why can't you broadcast it live?" he added. "It shows that they aren't transparent, they are just pretending to be."

Still, the court's Sina Weibo microblog has proved a huge hit, and an apparent temporary relaxation of censorship has allowed users to post comments about Bo which normally are swiftly removed, many supportive of his fiery defense and ridiculing the prosecution for relying on hearsay.

"Too funny! I can't believe they actually believed those casual comments and brought them out as evidence. Are they stupid or do they have some secret motive? Go Bo Xilai!" wrote one Weibo user.

"Looks like he'll only be sentenced to 3-5 years in the end. Great happiness," wrote another.

On Thursday, the number of people following the court's microblog feed jumped from 40,000 early morning to more than 250,000 in the late afternoon.

"This is the most difficult case since the trial of the Gang of Four and Chinese society has profoundly changed over the three decades," said Cheng Li, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "You can't have a completely secret trial."

a reason that authorities typically give for politically sensitive cases.

"No one in China believes that Bo is getting a fair trial," said Nicholas Bequelin, senior researcher at New York-based Human Rights Watch.

"This is not sufficient to enhance the trust that the citizenry has in its judicial system. This is a very carefully crafted piece of political theatre."

But some transparency to the trial is better than none, said He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University who has followed Bo's downfall closely.

"Bo Xilai is of course a popular political star, so publishing some of the transcript will allow many people to understand better what's going on," He said.

"Many people have serious doubts about this case. He's a hero to lots of people."

starting the stagnating economy.

Sharif began a third term as premier after the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party won a landslide victory in national polls in May. He has since been attempting to stamp his authority on a nation long plagued by instability and violence.

The results showed his party won at least another five seats in the 15 by-elections held on Thursday, reinforcing its comfortable majority with at least 189 seats in the 342-seat National Assembly.

The by-elections on Thursday were held in seats that were forced to annul results from the May vote because of violence or because candidates had since vacated their seats, among other reasons.

The populist Pakistan Peoples' Party, which held power for five years before Sharif's victory, won three seats, with corruption a lingering concern among voters.

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, led by former cricket star Imran Khan, also won two seats after promising to crack down on graft.

The secular Awami National Party, which has frequently been attacked by the Taliban in their stronghold in Pakistan's often lawless northwest, also won one seat.

Turnout from the polling was generally lower than the May vote, Pakistani media reported, and several areas reported problems.

In Peshawar, the High Court intervened to stop vote counting in two areas and ordered polls to be held again amid reports that elders had prevented women from voting.

Another poll was postponed amid security fears in the town of Dera Ismail Khan, where a militant raid on a jail freed 250 prisoners last month.

In the financial center of Karachi, a roadside bomb aimed at a military vehicle on election duty on Thursday killed a soldier and a civilian, as well as wounding 20 people, said Seemin Jamali, a doctor from the Jinnah medical center.

The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was their response to the government's offer of peace talks if the militants put down their arms.

"We wanted to convey a message to ... Nawaz Sharif that we would never lay down arms for the sake of meaningless talks and today's attack was to prove that we can strike wherever we wish," Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said.

held Damascus suburbs where poison gas appears to have killed hundreds just a few miles from the U.N. team's hotel.

There was no sign, however, that scientists would soon be taking samples at the scene of horrors that have drawn comparison with the gassing of thousands of Iraqi Kurds at Halabja in 1988.

The administration of President Barack Obama said it was "appalled" by the death reports.

A U.S. official familiar with initial intelligence assessments said the attack appeared to be the work of the Assad government. It was "the regime acting as a regime," the official said. But the Obama administration made clear that any response would await confirmation of a chemical attack and its origin.

Assad's opponents gave death tolls from 500 to well over 1,000 and said more bodies were being found in the wake of Wednesday's mysterious pre-dawn killer fumes, which the Syrian government insists were not its doing.

Images, including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters, showed scores of bodies laid out on floors with no visible signs of injury. Some had foam at the nose and mouth.

Talk, notably from France and Britain, of a forceful foreign response remains unlikely to be translated into rapid, concerted action given division between the West and Russia at Wednesday's U.N. Security Council meeting, and caution from Washington on Thursday.

Moscow has said rebels may have released gas to discredit Assad and urged him to agree to a U.N. inspection. On Wednesday, Russian objections to Western pressure on Syria saw the Security Council merely call in vague terms for "clarity" - a position increasingly frustrated Syrian rebels described as "shameful".

On Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Syria must let the U.N. team already in Damascus investigate "without delay". He said he would send a top U.N. disarmament official, Angela Kane, to lobby the Syrian government in person.

Ban said he expected a swift, positive answer.

Obama has directed U.S. intelligence agencies to urgently help establish what caused the deaths, a State Department spokeswoman said while acknowledging it may be difficult given the United States does not have diplomatic relations with Syria.

"At this time, right now, we are unable to conclusively determine CW (chemical weapons) use," the State Department's Jen Psaki told reporters. "We are doing everything possible in our power to nail down the facts," she added.

Another U.S. official said intelligence agencies were not given a deadline and would take the time needed to "reach a conclusion with confidence."

Former weapons investigators say every hour matters.

"The longer it takes, the easier it is for anybody who has used it to try to cover up," said Demetrius Perricos, who headed the U.N.'s team of weapons inspectors in Iraq in the 2000s.

Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons, and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas, sarin and VX nerve agents.

Syria's government, which has accused the rebels of using chemical weapons in the past, offered no public response to calls for wider U.N. access.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said world powers must respond with force if allegations that Syria's government was responsible for the deadliest chemical attack on civilians in a quarter-century prove true. But even Fabius stressed there was no question of sending in troops on the ground.

Britain, too, said no option should be ruled out "that might save innocent lives in Syria". But European forces can do little without U.S. help, and Washington shows little appetite for war.

Syrian officials have called allegations against their forces "illogical and fabricated". They point to the timing of the attack, days after U.N. inspectors arrived after months of argument, and to previous assurances that, if they possessed chemical weapons, they would never use them against Syrians.

After months of negotiating with Assad's government to let inspectors into Syria, a U.N. team arrived in Damascus four days ago. Their task is to check on the presence, but not the sources, of chemical weapons that are alleged to have been released in three specific, small incidents several months ago.

'WE'RE BEING EXTERMINATED'

Many rebels and activists in the opposition area say they have lost interest in promises of U.N. investigations or in help from abroad: "We are 7 km away, just a 5-minute car ride from where they are staying," said activist Bara Abdelrahman.

"We're being exterminated with poison gas while they drink their coffee and sit inside their hotels."

Qassem Saadeddine, a commander and spokesman for the rebels' Supreme Military Council, said the group was still deliberating on how or if it should respond: "People are growing desperate as they watch another round of political statements and U.N. meetings without any hope of action," he told Reuters.

Syria's revolt against four decades of Assad family rule has turned into a brutal civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people in two and half years and divided the Middle East along largely sectarian lines. Among world powers the conflict has revived Cold War-era East-West tensions and on the ground the struggle has limped to a poisonous stalemate.

Assad's Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam and has the backing of Iran and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

Western powers back the opposition but have been reluctant to fully commit to an Arab Sunni-backed revolt increasingly overtaken by Islamists linked to al Qaeda. Yet they have said the large-scale use of widely banned chemical weapons would be a game changer.

WORLD PAYING "LIP SERVICE"

Syria's southern neighbor Israel, still technically at war with Damascus, said it believed Syrian forces had used chemical weapons and accused the world of turning a blind eye: "The world condemns, the world investigates, the world pays lip service," Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz said.

In Paris, Fabius said that if the Security Council could not make a decision, one would have to be taken "in other ways", but he did not elaborate.

Immediate international action is likely to be limited.

European officials speaking on condition of anonymity said that options ranging from air strikes, creating a no-fly zone, or providing heavy weapons to some rebels were all still on the table - but that there was little prospect of concrete measures without U.S. backing, which still seemed unlikely.

"The American reaction following yesterday's attack was cautious," said one. "And without U.S. firepower there's little we can do."

While France and Britain took a lead in attacking Muammar Gaddafi's forces to help Libya's revolt in 2011, the ultimately successful campaign against an enemy far weaker than Assad's military also relied heavily on U.S. firepower and logistics.

Assad's forces continued a heavy bombardment of the Ghouta region for a third day on Thursday, which activists say will further hinder U.N. investigators from entering the area.

A spokesman from the opposition's Syrian National Coalition said bodies were still being found on the outskirts of Damascus.

"We expect the number to grow because we just discovered a neighborhood in Zamalka where there are houses full of dead people," said Khaled Saleh, speaking in Istanbul.

Fahad Almasri, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army in Paris, said local fighters had counted 29 separate projectiles fired from three military positions during Wednesday's pre-dawn attack, though not all appeared to have chemical warheads.

The firing from Qasioun mountain, Almezzah air base and a military compound in the suburb of Damascus hit targets across a swathe of towns and neighborhoods northeast of the capital.

headline: U.N. peacekeepers in Congo ordered to protect civilians after city shelled
byline: By Kenny Katombe
7:26pm EDT

The head of the U.N. mission in Congo on Thursday ordered peacekeeping troops to act to protect civilians after shelling hit the city of Goma in renewed fighting between the army and M23 rebels.

The fighting close to Goma, a city of a million people on the Rwandan border, comes after a relative lull in the 18-month rebellion. Late last month, the United Nations pledged to keep the M23 rebels out of range of the town, which they briefly seized last year.

Rwanda, which has long had strained relations with its neighbor, accused the Congolese army of deliberately firing artillery into its territory. Kinshasa denied the reports and repeated its accusation that Rwanda backs M23. Rwanda denies it.

Martin Kobler, head of the U.N. mission known as MONUSCO, said populated areas and U.N. positions had been directly attacked during the clashes on Thursday.

"I have ordered the MONUSCO Force to react and to take necessary action to protect civilians and prevent an advance by the M23," he said, without elaborating.

A Reuters reporter in Goma said three shells landed in the town and saw the bodies of two children killed in one of the explosions. Another civilian was killed and four others wounded, officials at a local hospital said. Two Congolese soldiers were also wounded, they said.

Fighting initially broke out late on Wednesday.

A senior U.N. official, who asked not to be named, said that on Thursday the rebels entered a security zone surrounding Goma, which was established by a new, robustly-mandated U.N. Intervention Brigade earlier this month.

The official said M23 had fired the shells that fell on Goma and across the border in Rwanda.

RWANDA BLAMES CONGO ARMY

Rwanda's defence ministry acknowledged a rocket had hit the Rwandan border village of Buga but blamed it on the Congolese army, calling it "completely unprovoked and senseless".

No casualties were reported in Rwanda, but the ministry said the explosion had damaged property.

The rebels rejected accusations they were behind Thursday's shelling, saying it was done by Congolese soldiers in an attempt to draw peacekeepers and Rwandan troops into the fight.

"We want the (Congolese army) removed from Goma and for it to be protected by the neutral forces of MONUSCO and the police. We have no intention of entering Goma," M23 spokesman Amani Kabasha said. "We are waiting for negotiations to start."

The M23 rebels began taking large swathes of Congo's volatile east early last year, accusing the central government of failing to honor a previous peace deal.

They dealt a serious blow to the image of MONUSCO - at 17,000 troops the world's largest U.N. mission - last November by marching past U.N. soldiers to briefly seize Goma.

They withdrew under a deal that called for peace negotiations between the rebels and Congolese government representatives. However the talks in the Ugandan capital Kampala have made little headway.

The 3,000-member U.N. Intervention Brigade - made up of South African, Tanzanian and Malawian troops - was established in the wake of Goma's seizure by M23 and is tasked with fighting and disarming rebel groups in Congo's volatile east.

MONUSCO said last month the new security zone established by the Intervention Brigade would keep Goma beyond the range of M23 and said the city would not come under attack again.



headline: Kenyan police warn of militant attacks in Mombasa over slain cleric
byline: By Joseph Akwiri
7:26pm EDT

linked militants may be planning attacks in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa to mark the anniversary of the assassination of a Muslim cleric, police said on Thursday.

Mombasa, which is Kenya's second-largest city and lies on the Indian Ocean coast, is a magnet for tourists and a trade gateway to the east and central African region.

Muslim cleric Aboud Rogo, accused by the Kenyan government and the United States of helping Islamist al Shabaab militants in Somalia, was killed on August 27 last year when unidentified gunmen sprayed bullets into his car. His killing sparked days of deadly riots in the city, where about 70 percent of residents are Muslim.

Police, who have not yet arrested the cleric's killers, said that al Shabaab may be planning to mark the anniversary of his death with violence.

"We have received intelligence information and are aware of threats by the al Shabaab terrorist network to launch attacks in sections of Mombasa city, to commemorate the killing of Sheikh Aboud Rogo last year," Robert Kitur, Mombasa county police chief, told Reuters.

"We are specifically alert about next week because that is when it will be exactly one year since his killing."

Kitur said security had been beefed up in the city, and that police had banned demonstrations to mark Rogo's death by his supporters.

Mombasa hosts the region's sole oil refinery, and its airport was temporarily used by international flights diverted from the region's main airport in Nairobi after the arrivals terminal was gutted in a fierce inferno in early August.

Kenyan troops entered Somalia two years ago to try to root out al Shabaab, which had been blamed for attacks in Kenya, triggering apparent revenge grenade and gun attacks in Mombasa, the capital Nairobi and frontier towns last year.

The riots that followed Rogo's death exposed deep social, political and sectarian divides in Mombasa and the coastal region. The government said the violence was organized by Kenya's "enemies" and blamed Muslim radicals for supporting al Shabaab.

Many Muslims blamed the authorities for the cleric's killing, and said it was part of a campaign against their community and faith.



headline: Fear of new showdown on Egypt streets in 'Friday of martyrs'
byline: By Lin Noueihed and Maggie Fick
7:26pm EDT

Supporters of Egypt's deposed president will stage a "Friday of martyrs" of mass protests, risking more potential bloodshed to show they can still claim the streets after a week in which hundreds were gunned down and their leaders jailed.

Egyptians are enduring the bloodiest civil unrest of their modern history after the military overthrew Mohamed Mursi on July 3 following demonstrations against his rule.

In a symbolic victory for the army-dominated old order, former autocrat Hosni Mubarak - toppled in a 2011 pro-democracy uprising - was freed from jail on Thursday, while his freely elected successor Mursi remains imprisoned.

A seven-week standoff turned into a bloodbath when the security forces dispersed Mursi's supporters' protest camps on August 14. They have since launched a campaign of arrests designed to break Mursi's 85-year-old Muslim Brotherhood, seizing figures that include its "general guide", Mohamed Badie.

At least 900 people, including 100 soldiers and police, have been killed in the past eight days, according to government sources. Brotherhood supporters say the real figure is far higher.

In recent days, Brotherhood protests that once attracted tens of thousands of people at locations across the country have ebbed, suggesting the group's famed organizational strength may have been damaged by the arrest of its leaders. Friday's protests will be a test of its resilience.

"We will remain steadfast on the road to defeating the military coup," a pro-Mursi alliance called the National Coalition to Support Legitimacy and Reject the Coup said in a statement. It named 28 mosques in Greater Cairo as points of departure for the protests.

The clampdown appears to have weakened the Arab world's oldest and most influential Islamist group, which survived for generations as an underground movement before emerging as Egypt's most organized political force when Mubarak fell.

The Brotherhood won five successive votes in Egypt following the 2011 uprising, but many Egyptians accused it of trying to monopolize power during Mursi's year in office, and huge crowds rallied against Mursi before the army removed him.

MUBARAK'S RELEASE

For Mubarak's enemies, the former autocrat's release marked a reversal of the 2011 pro-democracy uprising that brought down a military man who ruled for three decades as one of the pillars of authoritarianism in the Middle East.

A blue-and-white helicopter took Mubarak on Thursday from Cairo's Tora prison, where scores of his supporters had gathered to hail his release. He was flown to a military hospital in the nearby southern suburb of Maadi, officials said.

Mubarak's release plays into the Brotherhood's argument that the military is trying to rehabilitate the old order. The army-installed government casts its conflict with the Islamist movement as a life-or-death struggle against terrorism.

"Mubarak will never be an important political player, but symbolically, it's a victory dance by the reconstituted old state," Joshua Stacher, an Egypt expert at Kent State University in the United States, said of the former leader's release.

Adding to a sense among some activists that the freedoms won in the 2011 revolt are in danger, planned amendments to the constitution leaked to the media this week appear designed to place limits on political parties and ease restrictions on the participation of Mubarak-era officials in politics.

But some Egyptians, many of whom have rallied behind the army's crackdown, expressed fondness for the 85-year-old former air force commander whose tight grip on power brought stability.

"He protected the country," said Lobna Mohamed, a housewife in the crowd of Mubarak well-wishers. "He is a good man, but we want (Abdel Fattah) Sisi now," she said, referring to the army commander who overthrew Mursi and has become the face of the new army-backed government.

Mubarak was sentenced to life in prison last year for failing to prevent the killing of demonstrators. A court accepted his appeal earlier this year and ordered a retrial in the case, for which he has already served the maximum amount of pretrial detention.

MORE UPHEAVAL?

The military's declared plan for a return to democracy has yet to calm the most populous Arab nation, where security forces impose a nightly curfew as they hunt down Brotherhood leaders.

Alarmed by the bloodshed, the United States and European Union are reviewing their aid to Cairo.

Saudi Arabia, an enemy of the Brotherhood, has promised to cover any shortfall. It and other rich Gulf Arab states have already pledged $12 billion since Mursi's fall.

EU foreign ministers stopped short of agreeing immediate cuts in aid to Egypt on Wednesday, in part because of concern that doing so could damage any future EU mediation effort.

An EU attempt to broker a compromise collapsed before security forces cleared out the Brotherhood protest camps.

James Moran, the bloc's ambassador in the Egyptian capital, described reconciliation prospects as a huge challenge.

"Passions are high, emotions are high. Things have to cool off a little bit," he said. "One thing is for sure - the Islamist constituency is there, and you are going to have to find a way somehow of living with it."



headline: Colombia's farm protest has been infiltrated by FARC, government says
byline: By Helen Murphy
7:26pm EDT

A protest by thousands of Colombian farmers and truckers, which has blocked roads nationwide and become increasingly violent, has been infiltrated by Marxist FARC rebels, Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said on Thursday.

Clashes between police and agricultural workers became violent this week as authorities sought to remove dozens of roadblocks that have snarled travel on Colombia's highways and prevented produce getting to market.

Rocks and explosives were thrown as police launched teargas to clear protesters that Pinzon said have been mobilized in some areas by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

The demonstrations, which began on Monday, are the second wave of so-called national strikes against President Juan Manuel Santos' agriculture and economic policies which farmers say leave them unable to make any profit.

Much of the violence took place in central Boyaca province, a key farming area, as well as southwestern Cauca.

"Everyone knows that the terrorist FARC end up infiltrating these kinds of protests and cause disorder," Pinzon told reporters in Bogota.

"There are sectors that infiltrate these situations because, let's be frank, potato farmers, valuable people, workers, are not really prepared to use explosives against the police or burn cars; there has to be evil minds behind that."

Potato, corn and milk producers complain that free trade agreements with Europe and the United States have made it difficult to compete with cheap imports.

Some coffee growers have joined the protests, seeking more effort by the government to weaken the currency. They also want help to pay for fertilizers and other farming chemicals.

The FARC, which began as an agrarian struggle against rural inequality in 1964, on Monday issued a statement of support for the protest.

Pinzon's accusation against the FARC comes as the rebel group seeks to raise its influence in rural areas while it negotiates with the government on a peace deal to end its insurgency.

The two sides are currently discussing the rebels' inclusion in the political system if peace is achieved after reaching partial accord on agricultural reform.

run firms, jeopardizing a key plank of Finance Minister P.Chidambaram's blueprint to reverse the country's economic malaise.

Investor confidence has evaporated amid fears over the rising cost of funding India's gaping current account deficit, prompting New Delhi to delay plans to raise much-needed funds through partial privatizations, finance ministry sources said.

Hit by the U.S. Federal Reserve's preparations to wind down monetary stimulus, which is driving up borrowing costs globally, India's rupee has lost 17 percent since May - touching an all-time low of 65.56 to the dollar on Thursday - and the stock market is close to its lowest in 12 months.

"In the current situation, we cannot go to the market. We may have to wait for some more time before the market stabilizes," said an official who attended a meeting with the finance minister on Monday to plan for the next three months.

Three weeks ago the cabinet deferred a decision on selling an 11 percent stake in hydropower producer NHPC, which it had hoped would raise $300 million, after the power ministry raised concerns it would be undervalued in the current market.

Chidambaram announced in February a target of 400 billion rupees ($6.2 billion) for this fiscal year through partial sell-offs of state-run firms, as part of his efforts to stave off a threatened ratings downgrade by reducing the fiscal deficit to 4.8 percent of GDP.

His ministry has not officially abandoned the target - which many private sector economists already considered optimistic - and is hopeful conditions will improve before the financial year ends next March.

The top official from the finance ministry's divestment department, Ravi Mathur, is on a tour this week to Singapore and Malaysia to drum up investor interest in the stake sales and in a proposed exchange-traded fund of state-run companies.

"We need a short window of two months to raise the funds," a senior government official with direct knowledge of the stake-sale program said. He asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

"No one can say with certainty for how long the market will remain volatile," he said, adding that if it stabilized by the end of next month, the government could sell stakes in companies in October and November.

CURRENCY SLIDE

Past experience, however, shows that hitting the stake-sale target might be difficult. Similar goals were missed in each of the last three fiscal years, when market conditions were better.

India raised 239.56 billion rupees in fiscal 2012/13 against an initial target of 300 billion, and 138.94 billion rupees in the previous year against a target of 400 billion.

While a weak rupee makes Indian assets more affordable to foreign buyers, with no end in sight to the current crash rupee assets bought now will likely lose value in dollar terms.

Currency weakness particularly reduces the attractiveness of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). Sales of shares in IOC and Coal India Limited were expected to raise the bulk of the total stake sale target for this year.

IOC, the country's biggest refiner and retailer, sells fuels at state-set lower prices and gets partial compensation for the revenue losses through federal subsidies. However, because of the rupee's slide, its oil import bill has risen sharply, which has derailed plans to end subsidies on diesel by June 2013.

IOC's shares have dropped 30 percent since the beginning of May, when the rupee began its descent.

"All our oil companies now face difficult times," another finance ministry official said, noting it would not be easy to sell the stake in IOC because of the growing revenue losses.

In this fiscal year, which began in April, the government has so far raised $203 million by selling stakes in seven companies, including Hindustan Copper, MMTC Indian Tourism Development Corp. and Neyveli Lignite Corp..

UNION PUSHBACK

Plans to sell a 10 percent stake in Coal India have already been scaled back to 5 percent because of resistance from unions that now oppose any privatization of the world's largest coal company. They plan a three-day strike next month to stop the 5 percent sale from going ahead.

"Maybe the process (stake sale) itself might get delayed. (It) may not take place unless the market looks up," Coal India's personnel and industrial relations director, R. Mohan Das, told Reuters.

In June, Chidambaram said the government planned to raise nearly 200 billion rupees ($3.15 billion) from the sale of the 10 percent stake in Coal India alone. Now the government could expect to raise just $2 billion jointly from the sales of Coal India and IOC stakes, given current market valuations.

The cabinet approved the IOC share sale this month, the officials said. Divestments in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. before March 2014 are also key to the government's plans. ($1 = 64.2900 Indian rupees)



headline: Rockets from Lebanon fired at northern Israel; no casualties
byline: By Jeffrey Heller
6:20pm EDT

linked Islamist militants are opening a new front for confrontation with Israel.

The Israeli military said four rockets were fired from southern Lebanon. Two struck Israeli communities without causing casualties, a third was intercepted by the "Iron Dome" missile shield and the fourth fell outside Israeli territory, it said.

A U.S.-based group which monitors Islamist militants said the Brigades of Abdullah Azzam, an organization linked to al Qaeda, claimed credit for the rocket attack.

"A group official, Sirajuddin Zurayqat, who has appeared in prior releases from the Brigades, posted on his Twitter account that its Ziad Jarrah Battalions is 'behind the firing of the four rockets'," the SITE monitoring group said.

Southern Lebanon is a stronghold of Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas, who fought a 2006 war against Israel. But Israel blamed Thursday's salvo on a "global jihadi organization", its term for the Sunni Muslim al Qaeda and its offshoots.

HEZBOLLAH AND ASSAD

In Syria, Sunni Muslim jihadi fighters are battling alongside rebels trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad, who is supported by militants from the Shi'ite Hezbollah.

A strike on Israel by jihadists would be a show of force just a day after opposition activists in Syria accused Assad's loyalists of using chemical weapons to kill hundreds of people in a rebel-held Damascus suburb. Syria denied the allegations.

Israel believes jihadi groups in Egypt's lawless Sinai along Israel's southern border have been behind sporadic rocket attacks on its Red Sea resort of Eilat, where an Iron Dome battery shot down a rocket on August 13. On Monday, suspected Islamist militants killed 25 Egyptian policemen in Sinai.

Israeli leaders have said they fear al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria could eventually turn their sights on Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, or that Hezbollah might do so to deflect criticism from much of the Sunni Arab world for its potent support for Assad.

"(Thursday's rocket strike) is directly connected to all of the events taking place in the Middle East," said Brigadier-General Yoav Mordechai, the Israeli military's chief spokesman.

"Global jihad is looking for areas in which there is anarchy and chaos. We see them in Sinai, we find them in the Golan Heights, we find them in Lebanon, too," he said.

"They exploit opportunities ... and sometimes they try to attack Israeli citizens."

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, commenting on Thursday's strike, said in a statement that "anyone who tries to attack us should know that we will hurt them".

Israel's military, however, signaled it would not retaliate for now for the bombardment, which triggered warning sirens and sent residents in the north scrambling for shelter.

"The IDF (military) is regarding this as a one-time incident. There is no change in regulations or orders," Mordechai told Channel 2 television, looking to play down the attack, the first on northern Israel since May.

Israeli television showed photos of Iron Dome blowing up an incoming rocket. The military said it was destroyed between the Israeli coastal towns of Acre and Nahariya.

The military first said that in addition to the intercepted rocket, three fell in Lebanon.



headline: U.S. imposes financial sanctions on four Hezbollah leaders
byline: By Anna Yukhananov
5:56pm EDT

The United States on Thursday imposed financial sanctions on four men it said were leaders of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, accusing them of trying to spread terrorism in the Middle East, including Syria, Egypt and Yemen.

The United States considers Hezbollah a terrorist group and has sought to convince allies to adopt the same label, in part by highlighting what it says are illegal or destabilizing actions carried out by the group beyond Lebanon's borders.

One of the four men, Khalil Harb, planned attacks in Israel and neighboring countries, the Treasury Department said in a statement. Last year Harb started channeling money to Yemen, including a $50,000 monthly payment to a Yemeni political party, it said, but it did not say which party.

Treasury said another man, Muhammad Kawtharani, funded armed groups in Iraq and helped transport Iraqi fighters to Syria to join President Bashar Al-Assad's effort to halt the two-year-old revolt against his rule.

The other two men, Muhammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur and Muhammad Qabalan, were accused of leading attacks against tourists in Egypt as part of a Hezbollah cell.

Hezbollah's intervention in Syria helped spur the European Union last month to put the armed wing of the group on its terrorist blacklist.

The Treasury move on Thursday, although largely symbolic, effectively cut the four men off from the U.S. financial system and any dealings with U.S. citizens.

David Cohen, Treasury's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said U.S. sanctions could also encourage foreign banks, including those in Lebanon, to stop dealing with the men.

"By laying out in detail the activities of these Hezbollah leaders, we have exposed for the entire world to see ... what Hezbollah really is all about, which is exporting terrorist activity in a number of jurisdictions around the world," Cohen told reporters.

He said further information could also prompt U.S. partners in the European Union and Gulf countries to further restrict Hezbollah's activities and funding.

In prior actions, the Treasury also sanctioned what it said were Hezbollah's money laundering and drug trafficking in West Africa, and accused the group of carrying out terror attacks in places like Bulgaria and Thailand.

With a military force that rivals the Lebanese army, Shi'ite Hezbollah has used a mixture of political power and force since the end of Lebanon's 15-year civil war in 1990 to pursue its goals - officially defending the country from neighbor Israel.



headline: U.S. says unable to conclusively determine chemical weapons used in Syria
headline: Pakistan army says India kills two soldiers in Kashmir, envoy summoned
byline: By Katharine Houreld
7:26pm EDT

The Pakistani army said two of its soldiers were killed on Thursday in "unprovoked" Indian fire along the border dividing the disputed territory of Kashmir, and Islamabad summoned the Indian envoy to protest at the second such incident in two days.

A series of clashes that began this month has undermined a push by Pakistan's new civilian government to improve ties with old rival India. Lodging a protest with the Indian envoy appeared to mark a diplomatic escalation, but Pakistani officials say they still hope to hold talks.

A security official said one soldier was killed near Rawalakot in the Poonch district, about 130 km (81 miles) from the capital, Islamabad, "due to unprovoked Indian firing".

A second soldier was killed later in the day and two others were wounded 45 km (25 miles) away in Hotspring in the Tatta Pani area further south. India said it came under automatic weapons fire in roughly the same area in the evening and reported "effective retaliation" by its own soldiers, but made no mention of casualties.

Another Pakistani soldier had been killed on Wednesday.

The violence came two weeks after the killing of five Indian soldiers along the so-called Line of Control that separates the two sides in the Himalayan region.

India said the five were killed by Pakistani forces and said it had given its army a free hand to respond. Pakistan denied involvement and the government has issued a series of conciliatory statements despite constant tit-for-tat firing since.

"Pakistan will also continue to seek dialogue and resolution of all outstanding issues with India peacefully," the Pakistani government said in a statement on Thursday.

"The ceasefire should be maintained in letter and spirit. All military and diplomatic channels should be used to prevent ceasefire violations," it added.

A later statement said Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani called Indian High Commissioner T.C.A Raghavan to the foreign office in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad to express "serious concern over the continued and unwarranted ceasefire violations." Previous complaints by both sides have been made at a lower level in the diplomatic hierarchy.

The nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars since 1947, two of them over Kashmir. Both control a part of the Muslim-majority region but claim it in full.

A truce along their Kashmir border has held for nearly a decade, even though it has been broken every now and then by tit-for-tat artillery fire and an occasional cross-border ambush.

India has faced an insurgency in its part of Kashmir since 1989 and has long accused Pakistan of supporting the militants fighting Indian rule.

Pakistan denies arming the militants, saying it only offers moral support to the Muslim people of Kashmir, who are living under what Pakistan characterizes as harsh Indian rule.

Nevertheless, despite Pakistan's denials that it helps the militants, fighters have for years slipped from the Pakistani side of Kashmir into the Indian side to battle Indian forces.

India says this year it has seen a spike in attempts by militants to infiltrate into its part of Kashmir.

Many analysts expect the trend to continue as the two countries jostle for influence in Afghanistan, from which a NATO force is preparing to withdraw by the end of 2014.

Each nation fears the other is trying to install a proxy government in Kabul.

The new security law approved a force that will comprise 5,000 officers and will also allow judges and prosecutors to process drug-trafficking cases electronically from outside the Central American country for their own safety.

Honduras, home to the world's highest murder rate, has seen drug-related violence grow dramatically in recent years as traffickers use its territory to transport cocaine from producers in South America to consumers in the United States and Europe.

"Violence is in every neighborhood and every town and it needs to be confronted," said Honduran Security Minister Arturo Corrales. The Honduran army has led the fight against drug gangs until now.

President Porfirio Lobo is expected to sign the measure into law in the next few days.

In Mexico, where almost 80,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence since 2007, President Enrique Pena Nieto is seeking to build up a new militarized police force to tackle the country's drug war instead of the army.

moon asked the Syrian government on Thursday to allow U.N. inspectors to investigate the latest alleged chemical attack in the country's civil war "without delay" and grant them access to the site near Damascus.

Ban has asked the U.N. High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Angela Kane, to travel to Damascus to push for access for the U.N. team, which arrived in Syria on Sunday to investigate several previous claims of chemical weapons use.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government is under increasing pressure from Western and Gulf Arab countries and Assad's ally Russia to allow access to the rebel-held site of Wednesday's pre-dawn attack. The opposition Syrian National Coalition has also urged U.N. access.

"The Secretary-General believes that the incidents reported yesterday need to be investigated without delay," Ban's press office said in a statement. "A formal request is being sent by the United Nations to the government of Syria in this regard. He expects to receive a positive response without delay."

Syria's government offered no immediate public response to calls on Thursday for the U.N. team to inspect the site.

Assad opponents gave death tolls from the attack ranging from 500 to well over 1,000 and said on Thursday that more bodies were still being found. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons.

The U.N. team, led by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom, is already looking into three claims of chemical use in Syria's conflict. The United Nations has received a total of 14 reports of possible chemical attacks - one from Syria's government and the rest from Britain, France and the United States.

INQUIRY WON'T PLACE BLAME

The Syrian government and the opposition have accused each other of using chemical weapons, and both have denied doing so. The U.N. inquiry will try to establish only whether chemical weapons were used, not who used them.

Ban said on Monday that if the experts found that chemical weapons had been used then it would be up to "the international community to determine what course of action should be taken to prove ... accountability and what needs to be done."

"Use of chemical weapons is a violation of international law and international human rights law," Ban told a news conference.

The United Nations has been demanding unfettered access in Syria to conduct the investigation. Sellstrom's team consists of experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the World Health Organization.

Ban appointed Sellstrom to lead the inquiry in March, but diplomatic wrangling and concerns over safety prevented his team from entering Syria until this week.

Syria is one of seven countries that have not joined the 1997 convention banning chemical weapons. Western countries believe it has stockpiles of undeclared mustard gas, sarin and VX nerve agents.

The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict since 2011.

More than 1.9 million Syrians have fled the country - two-thirds of those since the start of the year - and more than 4.2 million people have been internally displaced, the United Nations has said. Most of those in need are women and children.



headline: Madagascar pushes back presidential election to October

Madagascar pushed back the date of its presidential elections for the third time on Thursday, to October 25, as the Indian Ocean island struggles to end years of political crisis.

The former French colony has been in chaos since Andry Rajoelina seized power with military support in 2009, ousting former President Marc Ravalomanana after opposition protests.

Its tourism industry has suffered badly from the turmoil, and foreign companies have been wary of committing to investment in its oil, gold, chrome and nickel reserves.

Rajoelina and Ravalomanana reached a deal with regional states in January to restore order, based on the condition neither of them would stand in the election, initially planned for May.

However, Ravalomanana's wife said she would run for the presidency instead, prompting Rajoelina also to declare his bid.

The election was postponed to July when the electoral commission said it was unprepared to hold the poll. It was then pushed back to late August because the decision by Rajoelina and Ravalomanana's wife to stand led to donors suspending financing for the poll.

At the weekend, the electoral court banned Rajoelina and Ravalomanana's wife, Lalao, from standing in the poll. The court also struck former President Didier Ratsiraka from the list of candidates.

The electoral commission said on Thursday that it was pushing back the election date to October 25 so it could change the list of candidates to exclude the three.

Beatrice Atallah, president of Madagascar's electoral body, said in a statement that a possible presidential run-off as well as parliamentary elections would be held on December 20.

The court's ruling barring the three candidates was widely welcomed by Western and regional powers who say the country needs a fresh start with new candidates.

The African Union, the South African Development Community (SADC) and key donors such as France and the European Union had applied heavy pressure to try to prevent the candidacies.

Norbert Ratsirahonana, special adviser to Rajoelina, said the president would respect the court's decision to block him from the race and had also accepted the new election date.

Lalao Ravalomanana was not immediately available to comment on her exclusion from the election.

On Monday, her supporters said they would take to the streets to protest against the "illegal" court ruling barring her from running, but this has failed to materialize.

Madagascar's economy shrank 4.6 percent in 2009, the year of the coup, after growing at 7.1 percent the year before. It is forecast to expand by just 2.6 percent this year, according to the World Bank.

election and vowing to press ahead with nationalist economic policies.

After taking the oath of office before bewigged Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku at a sun-drenched soccer stadium in Harare, Mugabe praised African countries that endorsed the July 31 vote and told his critics to "go hang".

"Except for a few Western dishonest countries, our elections have been hailed as peaceful, free, fair and credible," he said in an hour-long speech to thousands of cheering supporters, diplomats and six African presidents.

"For those odd Western countries who happen to hold a different negative view of our electoral process and outcome, there is not much that we can do about them. We dismiss them as the vile ones whose moral turpitude we must mourn," he added.

As he was sworn in, former colonial power Britain and the European Union repeated serious reservations about the credibility of the vote, already rejected by Mugabe's main rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, as a fraudulent "coup by ballot".

The new term will be Mugabe's fifth as president and extends his 33-year rule. He also served as prime minister after the end, in 1980, of white minority rule in the country previously known as Rhodesia.

Mugabe was declared the overwhelming winner in the July vote, putting an end to the unity government cobbled together after a disputed and violent poll in 2008.

That power-sharing deal with Tsvangirai's MDC party brought stability to an economy crushed by hyperinflation. Analysts are worried that with Mugabe's ZANU-PF now back in full control, the government may roll back reforms that had helped spur some growth.

Mugabe said his ZANU-PF party would advance an "indigenization" policy that forces foreign mining firms in the country to turn over majority stakes to local blacks, making it the centerpiece of its post-election economic revival program.

"The time has now come for us to extend our dominion to all those resources which the Almighty has been generous enough to give. That is the next revolution whose first step is this administration, this new government," he said.

His opponent in the last three elections, Tsvangirai, who has branded the election a "huge fraud", boycotted the ceremony.

A Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman said the party did not want to be associated with "election thieves". ZANU-PF has rejected all allegations of vote-rigging.

In his speech, Mugabe praised Tsvangirai for helping ensure a peaceful vote and being a partner in the coalition that produced a new constitution in March.

"FLAWED VOTE"

Britain said on Thursday Mugabe's re-election could not be deemed credible without an independent investigation into allegations of voting irregularities.

U.S. officials this week said the election was flawed and Washington had no plans to loosen sanctions until there were signs of change in the country.

Mugabe and senior ZANU-PF officials are the target of sanctions imposed by governments in the West, who accuse them of a history of human rights violations and vote rigging.

The European Union will review relations with Zimbabwe because of its "serious concerns" about the election, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said on Thursday. Its verdict on the fairness of the vote will be crucial to a decision on whether it continues to ease sanctions.

The stadium was filled with cheering, dancing supporters wearing ZANU-PF colors.

"It's Africa versus Europe, with Zimbabwe as the new battlefront," read one banner, reflecting the support former guerrilla chief Mugabe can still muster as a liberation war hero.

Unlike African monitors, Western observers were barred from travelling to Zimbabwe to scrutinize the July 31 vote.

After the voting went ahead peacefully, domestic monitors from the Zimbabwe Election Support Network said registration flaws might have disenfranchised up to a million people.

But observer missions from the regional 15-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union broadly endorsed the vote as free and peaceful and called on all parties to accept its results.

Mugabe, once dubbed the "thinking man's guerrilla" because of his bookish demeanor and the academic degrees he earned in jail in Rhodesia, used his speech to fire fresh barbs at his "neo-colonialist" foes.

He accused Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia of seeking to impose their political will on his state.

"Having struggled for our independence, our fate has irrevocably orbited out of colonial relations, indeed can no longer subsist in curtseying and bowing to any foreign government, however powerful it feigns itself to be and whatever filthy lucre it flaunts," he said to cheers.



headline: British police say seized Snowden-linked data could put lives at risk
byline: By Costas Pitas
7:26pm EDT

British police said on Thursday that documents seized from the partner of a journalist, who has led coverage of Edward Snowden's leaks about U.S. and British electronic spying, were "highly sensitive" and, if disclosed, could put lives at risk.

Counter-terrorism detectives said they had begun a criminal investigation following a preliminary examination of the material taken from David Miranda, partner of American journalist Glenn Greenwald, after he was held for nine hours at London's Heathrow Airport on Sunday.

The inquiry is the latest twist in a surveillance scandal that has pitted U.S. President Barack Obama against the Kremlin and prompted British Prime Minister David Cameron's advisers to demand the return of secrets from the Guardian newspaper.

Miranda, a Brazilian citizen who had been ferrying documents between Greenwald and a Berlin-based journalist contact of Snowden's, was held at Heathrow under anti-terrorism powers, before being released without charge minus his laptop, phone, a computer hard drive and memory sticks.

"Initial examination of material seized has identified highly sensitive material, the disclosure of which could put lives at risk," London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

The police refused to give any further details about the criminal inquiry, and Miranda's lawyer, Gwendolen Morgan, told reporters she knew very little about the investigation or what the basis for it was.

Earlier, Miranda's lawyers went to London's High Court to try to prevent British authorities from looking at the tens of thousands of documents on the seized devices.

However, two judges gave the authorities until August 30 to sift through the documents on the proviso it was for the defense of national security and to investigate any possible links to terrorism.

"We welcome the decision of the court which allows our examination of the material - containing thousands of classified intelligence documents - to continue in order to protect life and national security," the police statement said.

Greenwald, who is based in Brazil and writes for Britain's Guardian, has published articles based on documents leaked by Snowden, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor who faces criminal charges in the United States.

MEDIA FREEDOM

British security officials say the Snowden leaks, which showed the scale of U.S. and British eavesdropping on everything from phone calls and emails to internet and social media use, have undermined national security and could put lives at risk.

But the detention of Miranda and British government pressure on the Guardian have dragged Cameron into an international row over media freedom and the powers of the security services.

Germany has criticized Britain while Russia, which has granted Snowden temporary asylum, accused the British government of double standards over press freedom.

The Brazilian government, which has complained about the "unjustified" detention of Miranda, asked Britain to return the electronic equipment seized from him.

It was unclear what documents Miranda was carrying or what secrets could have forced Britain to act in such a way. Greenwald has vowed that Britain would come to regret its actions which he said were an attempt to intimidate him.

David Anderson, a lawyer who acts as Britain's Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, wrote to Home Secretary (interior minister) Theresa May on Thursday to say he would investigate whether the powers under which police detained Miranda were used lawfully.

Miranda's lawyers have also started legal action to ask judges to rule that his detention was illegal and his lawyer Morgan said they might seek to appeal the High Court's decision allowing the police to continue to inspect his material.

The Guardian said on Thursday that Miranda had been involved in legitimate journalistic activity. "We ... have grave concerns that today's judgment allows police to examine without any legal oversight journalistic material seized from David Miranda," it said in a statement on its website.

headline: MPs find German security shamefully negligent on neo-Nazi cell
byline: By Alexandra Hudson
7:26pm EDT

Nazi cell blamed for nine racist murders to go undetected for more than a decade, a parliamentary committee has concluded.

The stinging report came after a 19-month inquiry into the National Socialist Underground (NSU), whose chance discovery in late 2011 scandalized Germany and forced authorities to recognize the far-right fringe was more brutal and organized than previously thought.

Their investigation revealed a multitude of mistakes at all levels, by Germany's patchwork of state and national police, prosecutors and intelligence agencies - and a systematic failure to consider racist motives behind the shootings of eight Turks and a Greek between 2000 and 2007, later attributed to the NSU.

Authorities assumed the killings must be due to feuds within the Turkish underworld and their one-sided investigations led to a series of dead-ends. Victims' families have spoken of their despair at finding themselves the object of suspicion in the midst of their grief.

"Turks murder Turks, that seems to have been the mentality," said Sebastian Edathy, the Social Democrat (SPD) chairman of the committee.

"Changing this will take longer than changing laws... I don't think it is a case of institutional racism, but we do have racists working within the security authorities," he added.

The committee urged state bodies to work together better and said possible racist motives for a crime should always be considered. It recommended that security forces hire more people from ethnic minorities to reflect a multicultural society.

But lawmakers did not find evidence that anyone within the security forces deliberately protected the NSU and helped them avoid detection, though they did recommend new guidelines on the use of informants, after allegations that officers were often more interested in protecting informants than pursuing leads.

MUNICH TRIAL

Beate Zschaepe, the only suspected member of the NSU who is still alive, went on trial in Munich in May. She is charged with complicity in the shooting of eight Turks, a Greek and a German policewoman, two bombings in immigrant areas of Cologne and 15 bank robberies.

Her two presumed male accomplices both committed suicide in 2011. Zschaepe faces life imprisonment.

The case shook a society that believed it had learned the lessons of the past, as well as undermining the trust of the migrant community in the German state's security apparatus.

"The only way to win back this trust is through the detailed and comprehensive study of these murders. The inquiry by the parliamentary committee makes a key contribution to this," said Maria Boehmer, minister of state for migrants.

The existence of the NSU came to light in November 2011 when the two men believed to have founded the cell with Zschaepe, Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Boehnhardt, committed suicide after a botched bank robbery and set their caravan ablaze.

In the charred vehicle, police found the gun used in all 10 murders and a grotesque DVD claiming responsibility for them.

Zschaepe has kept silent since her arrest, leaving people struggling to make sense of her motives and to understand how an ordinary teenager could sink so deeply into the neo-Nazi scene.

The head of the domestic intelligence agency (BfV) resigned last year after it emerged that files on the use of informers were destroyed after the NSU's discovery. The BfV was singled out for failing to analyze the threat posed by the far right.



headline: Senior Sicilian mafia member denied bail in London court

7:26pm EDT

A Sicilian mafioso arrested after living in Britain quietly under an assumed name for 20 years was denied bail for a second time on Thursday by a London court, as Italian authorities seek his extradition to serve a jail term.

Domenico Rancadore, known to his neighbors in the London suburb of Uxbridge as Marc Skinner, has been described by the Italian Interior Ministry as a leading member of the Cosa Nostra and accused of mafia association, extortion and other serious crimes.

Rancadore, 64, was first arrested at his London home on an Italian warrant on Aug 8. After concerns were raised about the warrant, Italy later issued a new one and he was re-arrested on court premises and denied bail.

Nicknamed "u profissuri" (the professor) in Sicilian dialect, he is the son of Giuseppe Rancadore, former boss of a Mafia clan in Trabia near Palermo, who is serving a life sentence in jail.

Dressed in a navy blue and red-striped rugby shirt, the tanned, grey-haired Rancadore sat in the dock on Thursday clutching what appeared to be a white copy of the Bible.

He shook his head and made frequent eye contact with his British wife Anne, who sat in the public gallery of Westminster Magistrates' court.

Defense lawyer Alun Jones said the family's suburban semi-detached home, estimated to be worth between 360,000 and 370,000 pounds ($570-580,000), was being offered as a surety for bail, in addition to 10,000 pounds.

He argued Rancadore would not abscond, saying he suffered from angina and reflux, underwent a heart procedure in December, and was only sleeping two hours a night.

But Judge Quentin Purdy told Rancadore: "It seems to me clear that if you are released on bail there is a risk you will disappear. Your family has every reason to support you in that course of action."

The prosecution has said Rancadore was considered "a man of honor" in Cosa Nostra, a group that "spread terror in Sicily". He was said to be in charge of a territory around Trabia and had ensured strict compliance with the organization's rules in the area.

The father of two came to Britain in 1993, where he used his wife's family name, Skinner. He was later tried in his absence in Italy and sentenced to seven years in prison over Mafia activities from 1987 to 1995.

Rancadore had a female interpreter by his side. Purdy said he would appear before the same court via video link on September 20. ($1 = 0.6374 British pounds)



headline: Putin foe fails to oust Moscow mayor from election race
byline: By Steve Gutterman
3:59pm EDT

Kremlin rival out of the Moscow mayoral race and an electoral official said Navalny himself might be disqualified.

Navalny, who emerged from a wave of anti-government protests that began in 2011 as the most popular opposition figure, was sentenced to five years in prison last month for theft after a trial he has said was President Vladimir Putin's revenge.

But he is free pending a ruling on the appeal against his politically charged conviction and is running for mayor of Moscow to try to show that Putin's opponents have popular support even though the protests have faded.

Needling Putin and Sergei Sobyanin, the acting Moscow mayor appointed by the Kremlin three years ago, Navalny claimed the Kremlin favorite had violated election rules by failing to receive Putin's formal consent to run in the September 8 vote.

Lawyers for Navalny ridiculed a document presented as proof - a copy of a letter from Sobyanin asking for Putin's approval, with the single word "approve" scrawled above a signature purported to be Putin's.

"This is no document," lawyer Nikolai Kuznetsov told Reuters at the court, saying that only a decree or order from Putin would have legal force and that the original was never produced. "The same thing could have been done on a cocktail napkin."

The judge retired for about 10 minutes and emerged to announce his ruling against Navalny's claim.

"We are not satisfied with this process because the judge refused to take into account our arguments," Kuznetsov said.

Meanwhile, authorities made clear it is Navalny who might be ejected from the race, which pits him against a loyal and experienced politician touted as a potential future prime minister under Putin, who started a six-year third term in 2012.

Moscow elections chief Valentin Gorbunov said Navalny's team had committed campaign violations and that the city electoral commission would likely meet soon to discuss their severity and potential consequences, state-run news agency RIA reported.

"If the violations exceed the legally established norm, the question of revoking the registration of the candidate Navalny will emerge," RIA quoted Gorbunov as saying.

CAMPAIGN TRICKS?

Electoral officials said checks had established that Navalny's campaign distributed materials that were paid for with funding from outside his campaign chest, RIA reported.

Last week, Russian prosecutors accused Navalny of illegally receiving foreign funding for his campaign, which he denied.

Navalny, 37, said the allegations were meant to discredit him and showed the Kremlin was worried his campaign was reducing Sobyanin's big lead in opinion polls. He says he is the one facing a campaign of dirty tricks.

Blaming what he claimed was pressure from Sobyanin's administration, he said on Tuesday a contract with a popular Russian social-networking site had been abandoned and talks with a radio station on airing his campaign ads had fallen through.

Polls suggest Navalny has no chance of winning, but a strong showing for the activist and anti-corruption blogger, whose description of ruling United Russia as a "party of swindlers and thieves" became a mantra at protests, would embarrass Putin.

Alexei Roshchin, a veteran campaign adviser and sociologist, said Navalny might be disqualified if Kremlin officials feared Sobyanin might fall short of the majority - 50 percent plus one vote - the he needs to avoid a runoff.

A decisive victory over Navalny would be a boon for Sobyanin, 55, who is widely believed to have called the early election in order to increase his legitimacy by becoming an elected official instead of an appointee.



headline: North Nigeria's poor beat path to nascent mining boom
byline: By Tim Cocks
7:26pm EDT

Like almost everything else in Nigeria's economy, mining of metals and other solid minerals fell by the wayside when the West African nation discovered oil.

In the two decades to 1954, foreign companies produced around 360,000 ounces of gold in total, according to government statistics - tiny by today's standards, but not insignificant for a country approaching independence with high hopes.

By 1964 - post-independence and less than a decade after oil was found in the creeks of the southern Niger Delta - gold production had largely ground to a halt.

Now much of the digging up of Nigeria's minerals is done by artisanal miners in the largely Muslim north, bereft of the high-tech machinery that makes it safe and brings economies of scale.

"The sector was left in the hands ... of untrained and ill-equipped artisans ... making negligible contributions to GDP," was how a government policy brief summed it up last year.

Nigeria's solid minerals remain untapped and largely unmapped, an anomaly in a region that is a growing source of materials such as iron ore, gold, diamonds, uranium and bauxite.

The government wants to change that. Mines Minister Musa Sada aims to revive mining's contribution to the economy to 5 percent from its current 1 percent by 2015.

He is wooing investors with a simplified code of rules relating to the mining industry, tax holidays and waivers on duties for imported machinery.

Yet for all that, interest remains confined to small development firms such as Australia's Kogi Iron for iron ore and Australian Mines and Savannah Gold in gold.

That is partly because Nigeria has yet to see the "big find" needed to attract the majors. Even rosy government estimates of reserves are dwarfed by other West African states.

"Until someone finds a big deposit, no one's going to flock into Nigeria," Australian Mines Managing Director Ben Bell told Reuters. "It really just needs that first discovery."

Nigeria's newfound enthusiasm for mines unhappily coincides with a period of shareholder pressure on mining companies to rein in spending, sell marginal assets and tackle debt after years of acquisitions.

"LUCKY DAY"

In Bagega, a village flanked by baobab trees and fields growing millet in Zamfara, one of the country's poorest and most remote states, local miners break up rocks and feed them into small grinding machines. The machines then crush them into gravelly sand, kicking up clouds of lead-contaminated dust.

The miners sift through the powdery rock in metal bowls filled with soap and water. Some will find gold, some won't.

"It depends if it's your lucky day," said Salisu Shamsudeen, 21, after holding up a pea-sized ball of gold ore to the baking sun. To the untrained eye his treasure looks like tinfoil.

"One find could make you 2,000 naira ($12.38) or 1 million naira ($6,200)," he said, shrugging.

For many northerners, the neglect of the mining sector, like that of the region's agriculture and cotton mills, is emblematic of the way oil has shifted economic and political power to the largely Christian south - a source of resentment that has fuelled conflicts such as a four-year-old Islamist insurgency.

"They've totally neglected solid minerals because they only care about oil. The government has neglected a lot of the northern economy," said Mudassir Abdullahi, a geologist with Chinese-Nigerian venture, Zamfara Mining Corporation.

Neglect of remote bits of the north was highlighted when a series of lead poisoning incidents struck Zamfara. It has killed more than 500 children since 2009, when a surge in world bullion prices spurred a gold rush there, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) says.

Prices have fallen dramatically since April, another reason foreign firms are likely to be reluctant to explore.

Gold in rocks usually comes with other metals. In Zamfara, that metal is lead. Thousands of children have dangerously high lead levels in their blood, says MSF, which runs a treatment clinic there. Many are permanently brain damaged.

After agreeing to clean up the lead, authorities took two years to provide the money and a further five months to finish the job, which they finally did last month, MSF country head Michelle Chouinard told Reuters in an interview.

At an MSF clinic near the Bagega mines, 22-year-old housewife Fati Sahiru arrived with her two lead-poisoned young children. One of them, Abdul, was two years old. She gave a straight answer as to why her husband continued to mine gold.

"It makes more money than farming," she said. "Much more."

"STRATEGIC MINERALS"

Mines ministry data obtained by Reuters identifies seven "strategic" minerals in which it sees greatest economic promise.

Apart from gold, of which the ministry says 300,000 ounces are proven - equivalent to just a tenth of Ghana's output in 2012 - but six times as much estimated, there are also an estimated 3 billion tons of iron ore. Guinea's huge Simadou deposit has 2.25 billion tonnes, but that is proven.

Other minerals are: 27 billion barrels of bitumen, 2.23 trillion tonnes of limestone, 14 million tonnes of tonnes of barites and about a million tonnes of zinc-lead.

Proven coal reserves come to 639 million tonnes, and 2.7 billion tonnes estimated, which the government plans to use for domestic power.

At the Zamfara Mining site, a digger piled up crushed rock in front of a concrete building, where workers with shovels moved it into a system of funnels and sifting machines.

It is a frontier operation, but still a leap from the artisanal mine shafts up the road, where miners lower themselves hundreds of feet into the earth to chisel gold ore. In one, four miners took turns to go in, next to a dirt heap they said was a collapsed mine shaft that had buried three people alive.

Mines minister Sada told Reuters mining majors were waiting for "mining laws and regulations that are in line with world best practice" and better infrastructure, adding that "we are working hard to get those kinds of heavy investors".

Bell from Australia Mines said a lack of mining infrastructure meant that "we had to bring everything in from outside".

Another issue is security in north Nigeria. Kidnapping of Westerners by Islamist insurgents Boko Haram or Ansaru make it potentially dangerous for expatriates in the north, and sites would be easy targets for armed robbers.

Firms also face negotiating with corrupt local and state governments, a legacy of Nigeria's tripartite federal system.

Yet even if Nigeria's precious metals don't live up to the hopes, it has more mundane materials that it wouldn't need to export. Cement is a multi-billion-dollar business in a country of 170 million with a housing shortage. It made Nigerian Aliko Dangote Africa's richest man, with a Forbes-estimated net worth of $20 billion.

Dangote Cement and France's Lafarge are both making a fortune churning out millions of tonnes of cement. That 2 trillion tonnes of limestone won't go to waste.



headline: Greek PM meets billionaire Saudi prince to discuss investments
headline: Yemen asks U.S. for drones to fight al Qaeda
byline: By Mohammed Ghobari
3:59pm EDT

Rabbu Mansour Hadi said on Thursday, to help it fight an al Qaeda threat that recently forced Western countries to temporarily close diplomatic missions in Sanaa.

State news agency Saba also quoted Hadi as telling police cadets that 40 suspected al Qaeda militants had been killed in recent counter-terrorism operations and vowed to keep fighting the Islamists until they laid down their weapons.

Hadi, who came to power in 2011 after months of turmoil forced his predecessor to step down, irked Yemenis last year by giving unequivocal support for Washington's controversial drone strikes, which have increased under President Barack Obama.

"The drones that are conducting operations are part of the cooperation between us and the United States," Hadi told the cadets.

He said Yemen had allowed the United States to undertake such operations because his country did not possess such technology to carry out "these precise military missions".

"I have discussed the issue of helping us acquire this technology with the U.S. administration," Saba quoted Hadi as saying, adding that the Yemeni army was capable of using drones.

The Yemeni army, with U.S. backing, last year drove al Qaeda militants and their allies from strongholds they seized during months of turmoil against Saleh's rule.

But the militants have since regrouped and mounted attacks on government officials and installations.

"We will pursue them until they seek peace, give up their weapons and return to their senses as Yemeni citizens and not as enemies of Yemen, and kick out the foreigners who carry out these military attacks with them," he said.

Hadi defended the use of drone strikes, saying they were more accurate than other methods. He said that a 2009 strike that killed scores of Yemeni civilians in Abyan province resulted from a cruise missile and not a drone.

Restoring stability to Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Arab world and next door to the world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia, is an international concern.

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has used Yemen to plot an attack on international aviation and attacked a U.S. warship and a French supertanker in Yemeni waters.

Yemen said earlier this month it had foiled a major al Qaeda plot to seize two oil and gas export terminals and a provincial capital in the east of the country.

headline: Election ads put Merkel in focus while rivals hide their man
byline: By Erik Kirschbaum
7:26pm EDT

Germany's conservative Christian Democrats will focus their TV advertising campaign on Chancellor Angela Merkel while the opposition Social Democrats put ordinary people in their ads and all but ignore their struggling candidate, Peer Steinbrueck.

The rival parties kicked off the final month of campaigning for the September 22 election by presenting strikingly different TV strategies on Thursday. Merkel's conservatives hold a 16-point lead over the SPD in opinion polls but her center-right coalition may fall short of a majority.

"Germany is in good shape and we can't allow that to be put at risk," Merkel calmly intones in the central message of the 90-second advert, which includes unusual high-definition close-ups of the 59-year-old leader.

"Higher taxes and other burdens wouldn't be good for Germany," the chancellor adds, indirectly attacking plans by the SPD and their Greens allies to raise taxes on high wage earners.

TV ads play a much smaller role in German campaigns than in countries like the United States but can give clues to parties' strategies, as well as trying to make sure each side's own supporters get out and vote on election day.

They are broadcast eight times for free in prime time by the big public networks, ARD and ZDF, and more than 100 times on private networks. The SPD ads begin airing on Thursday evening and the conservatives next Monday.

"It's a film about Germany, about our country's future and what's good for us," said CDU campaign manager Hermann Groehe, dismissing criticism that the ads ignore the party while zooming in for uncomfortable close-ups of the chancellor.

"I like seeing the close-up shots of her," Groehe added after repeatedly screening the ads featuring Merkel's face.

The conservatives, who have suffered a string of regional election defeats in recent years, pin their hopes on Merkel. Her steady leadership in the euro crisis, when she has conditioned help for struggling nations on tough economic reforms, has been the cornerstone for her popularity in Germany.

By contrast, the SPD opts to keep its unpopular candidate off screen for most of its ad. Instead, ordinary working people at locations around Germany stand at a red lectern with "SPD" on it, explaining the issues that are important for them.

One man demands the introduction of a minimum wage, another attacks bank bailouts, another expresses fears of worsening old-age poverty while one woman complains about the growing gap in medical care between rich and poor.

"Peer Steinbrueck didn't want to be the focal point of our ads," said SPD general secretary Andreas Nahles. "He explicitly wanted these ads to be about regular people and their genuine concerns. None of these people were cast. They're all real."

election in a July vote was not credible.

Mugabe, who has ruled since independence from Britain in 1980, has told critics of his re-election to "go hang" and has vowed to press ahead with nationalist policies forcing foreign firms to turn over majority stakes to black Zimbabweans.

He took his new oath of office before bewigged Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku at a ceremony held in a 60,000-seat football stadium in Harare witnessed by thousands of cheering supporters, diplomats and delegations from the region.

His longtime rival and opponent in the last three elections, Morgan Tsvangirai, boycotted the ceremony. He has denounced the July 31 election as a "huge fraud" and a "coup by ballot", alleging massive rigging by Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. Mugabe and his ruling party have rejected these allegations.

This will be Mugabe's fifth term as president of the southern African state. He had also served two terms as prime minister after 1980 independence ended white minority rule in the country previously known as Rhodesia.

Mugabe and senior officials from his ruling ZANU-PF party are the target of sanctions imposed by governments in the West, which has accused them of staying in power through massive human rights violations and vote rigging.

Britain said on Thursday Mugabe's re-election could not be deemed credible without an independent investigation into allegations of voting irregularities.

U.S. officials this week said the election was flawed and Washington had no plans to loosen sanctions until there were signs of change in the country.

The European Union will review relations with Zimbabwe given its "serious concerns" about the election, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said on Thursday.

The EU's verdict on the fairness of the elections will be crucial to a decision on whether it continues to ease sanctions.

Soon after the July 31 vote, which went ahead peacefully in contrast to 2008 election violence, domestic monitors from the Zimbabwe Election Support Network said registration flaws may have disenfranchised up to a million people out of 6.4 million registered voters.

But observer missions from the regional 15-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union broadly endorsed the vote as free and peaceful and called on all parties to accept its results.



headline: Web-based apps pose tricky problem for Saudi monitors

based applications that offer a freedom to communicate that is impossible for most Saudis in the real world, and may even seek to ban such apps altogether.

Saudi Arabia remains a relatively closed society; gender mixing is restricted to a tight circle of relatives and family friends, and direct criticism of the ruling family or powerful conservative clergy is frowned upon. Morality police patrol the kingdom's few public spaces such as shopping malls to enforce rigid social rules.

Cyberspace presents considerably more complicated challenges than a shopping center, however, and Saudi authorities are alarmed by the unfettered contact that the Internet allows, including for activists who spread news and information not covered by state media.

With just under half the kingdom's nearly 27 million population younger than 25, according to the CIA Factbook, Saudis are avid users of social media of all kinds.

"People use social media ... more than asking to meet in person. It's safer," said a Jeddah-based activist, who like others interviewed for this story asked not to be named because he feared reprisals from state authorities. "We know they are watching us, but they cannot control us on social media."

The number of Twitter users in Saudi Arabia nearly doubled in six months to 2.9 million in July 2012, amounting to a little over 10 percent of the population, according to analysts Semiocast. By April of this year, the kingdom was the eighth biggest user of Twitter globally, accounting for 2.3 percent of all tweets, Semiocast estimates.

The kingdom now has the biggest number of viewers per capita of YouTube globally, according to the website, which has spawned a thriving industry producing homemade videos that is pushing at the boundaries of traditional Saudi programming.

These production houses are Saudi-run and alert to local sensitivities, avoiding politics and using satire to cover local news for example, and so Saudi authorities are turning a blind eye to their activities - for now.

Free and easy-to-use communication applications present a more immediate social - and commercial - hazard.

Tech-savvy young Saudis are increasingly moving away from traditional telephony provided by the kingdom's three mobile operators, Saudi Telecom Co (STC), Etihad Etisalat (Mobily) and Zain Saudi - the government has stakes in STC and Mobily - and toward apps such as Skype, WhatsApp and Viber.

The telephone and messaging applications allow users to circumvent strict state controls with a degree of anonymity. According to the website of WhatsApp, each user is able to create up to 50 group chats of up to 50 participants each.

"If you open the phone of any Saudi you'll find at least 10 to 15 WhatsApp groups - some groups have more than 5,000 members and send out a daily news round-up," said a rights activist in Qatif in the restive Eastern Province, home to many of the kingdom's Shi'ite minority.

"WhatsApp is now used much more than email, because it's seen as easier and more secure."

BREAKING THE LAW

For the Saudi ruling class, which runs the country according to a strict interpretation of Islamic law, these are worrying trends.

"Non-democratic governments are terrified by the role of social media and the threats posed to their regimes by open and uncensored online communications," said Craig Newman, head of the Freedom2Connect Foundation (F2CF), a New York-based non-profit organization.

The Saudi regulator, the Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC), said in March that communications apps, including Skype, Viber and WhatsApp, broke unspecified laws and ordered operators carrying these services to comply with the regulations without making clear how.

Then in June the regulator banned Viber altogether. Saudi newspapers a week later carried reports that WhatsApp would also be banned within weeks, though nothing has been heard on this since.

CITC did not respond to requests for comment on this story, but said in a statement that it was protecting society from "negative aspects that could harm the public interest".

WhatsApp and Twitter declined to comment, as did Saudi Telecom, Mobily and Zain Saudi, all three of which have lost income as customers switch to Web-based alternatives. Skype did not respond to requests for comment.

The operator losses - and customer savings - are particularly significant when it comes to the country's large expatriate population using such applications to call or message home. According to the CIA Factbook, there are 5.6 million expats in Saudi, about 21 percent of the population.

Newspapers, quoting unnamed state sources, said CITC has asked operators to find ways to block and monitor the apps.

Respected U.S. software engineer Moxie Marlinspike said he had been contacted by Mobily and asked to build surveillance tools to intercept messages on Twitter and other services.

Mobily in May denied it had contacted Marlinspike, but the engineer gave Reuters copies of emails from a Mobily employee supporting his assertion.

ACTIVISTS' TOOLS

Human rights activists say social media and tools such as WhatsApp are vital to their work. Television and local newspapers, which do not deviate from the official line, do not cover rights issues.

"We're getting news out to the rest of the world any way we can - if we don't have secure communications then Saudi Arabia will go back to being the Kingdom of the Dark, where nobody knows what's going on," said the Qatif-based activist.

Another Qatif-based activist said he was the administrator of six WhatsApp groups, which combined had more than 1,000 members. WhatsApp is preferred because unlike some other instant messaging apps, WhatsApp has the option for only administrators to know the identity of group members.

"If they close WhatsApp it will be difficult to send group messages via mobile; individual texts will be very expensive," said the second activist.

Experts say that banning the likes of WhatsApp will just push communications to other mobile applications, or possibly to the less convenient use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and Tor.

VPNs use an encrypted server connection, usually in another country, which makes it appear as though the user is actually in that location. Secure browser Tor is able to disguise the origins of user data by sending it through three servers picked randomly among 3,000 dotted across the globe.

Social media played a big role in nurturing and coordinating protests that ultimately led to the ousting of long-standing rulers in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Saudi Arabia has taken a carrot-and-stick approach to avoiding similar unrest.

King Abdullah has ordered $110 billion in government handouts and welfare schemes, but activists who attacked the government on human rights grounds have also been imprisoned.

"There are people who misuse social networking and try to send false information and false evaluation of the situation in the kingdom," security spokesman Major General Mansour al-Turki told a news conference in February.

He later told Reuters that authorities did not want to limit Internet access on security grounds, however.

Some among the Saudi elite have argued that censorship is a waste of time.

"This is a futile contest - launching a war against media, and especially social media, that are open to free expression is a lost cause," Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire with a stake in Twitter, said in a March television interview.

But Prince Alwaleed, in his late 50s, is a rare liberal voice. The leading members of Saudi's ruling royals, now in their 70s or 80s, are experiencing a generational disconnect.

"They don't understand us," said the Jeddah-based activist. "They have one way to control the kingdom - they say they guarantee our safety ... We ask for more."



headline: Kazakh tycoon sought by Russia, Ukraine to stay in French jail
byline: By Jean-Francois Rosnoblet
5:56pm EDT

Kazakh oligarch Mukhtar Ablyazov, accused of embezzling up to $6 billion from his former bank, was denied release on bail from a French jail on Thursday while he awaits a decision on whether he will be extradited.

The 50-year-old has been in custody at the Aix-Luynes jail in southern France since he was arrested near the Riviera resort of Cannes in July after 18 months as a fugitive.

Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan brought fraud charges against him after BTA, the Kazakh bank he once controlled, was seized by Kazakh authorities and declared insolvent in 2009. Ukraine and Russia have both demanded his extradition.

BTA, which has Russian and Ukrainian subsidiaries, later brought a $6 billion fraud case against him in Britain.

Ablyazov, who denies the fraud charges which he says are designed by strongman Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev to silence him as a political rival, went on the run after being handed a jail sentence for contempt of court by a British judge.

Provence decided on Thursday that the former banker should not be freed for his own safety, his lawyer Bruno Rebstock told Reuters.

"Threats against Ablyazov and the consideration that he's safer inside prison than out motivated the court's decision to reject his (bail) request," Rebstock said.

A hearing expected in September will examine whether France will extradite Ablyazov to Ukraine or Russia.

Ablyazov, a former Kazakh government minister, fled Kazakhstan in 2009 after BTA was seized. He was granted political asylum in Britain in 2011, giving BTA the jurisdiction to bring a civil claim against him on British soil.

He has said his life has been in danger since he left Kazakhstan and that he feared for his safety in a British jail.

FAMILY'S FEARS

Any extradition process from France would take several months, legal sources say, as Russia and Ukraine would have to compile and send to French authorities the necessary proof justifying the charges filed against him.

Ablyazov cannot be extradited to Kazakhstan because it is not a member of the Council of Europe extradition convention, but his family has said it fears that Ukraine plans to subsequently transfer him there.

An English High Court judge in March effectively declared Ablyazov guilty of committing one of the largest frauds ever tried in Britain - although his lawyers said later that judgment was based on "unproven assumptions".

His lawyers were also barred from making oral submissions to court because, a judge said, he had ignored court orders to turn himself in and fully declare his assets.

BTA said in a statement on Thursday that it welcomed the French court's decision to deny Ablyazov's bail request.

"He is already a fugitive from Kazakhstan and the UK and has consistently demonstrated that he cannot be trusted to respect any laws which would hold him to account for his fraud," said BTA's managing director, Pavel Prosyankin.

"We expect that his attempts to deflect attention from his criminal activity will fail in France, as it did in the UK."

In May, Ablyazov's wife and six-year-old daughter were deported from Rome to Kazakhstan in a case that caused a furor in Italian politics and prompted calls for the resignation of Italy's interior minister.



headline: Tunisian Islamists accept union plan to resolve crisis
byline: By Tarek Amara and Tom Heneghan
7:26pm EDT

Tunisia's governing Islamists edged closer to negotiations with secular opponents on Thursday by agreeing in principle to a plan for a transition toward new elections proposed by the powerful trade unions.

The birthplace of the Arab Spring revolts, Tunisia is struggling to defend its nascent democracy against political polarization and popular discontent, especially after Egypt's army ousted another elected Islamist leader, Mohamed Mursi.

Rached Ghannouchi, chairman of the Islamist Ennahda party, said negotiations would quickly resolve the standoff that has paralyzed Tunisian politics for almost a month and led to major protests and calls for the government to resign.

"We will get out of this crisis very soon," Ghannouchi told journalists after meeting UGTT Secretary General Hussein Abassi. "We accept the UGTT initiative in principle to begin the dialogue" with the opposition.

Opposition leaders accused Ghannouchi of trying to buy time and repeated their demand that Ennahda give up power. The party later said in a communiquĂŠ it would stay on until the planned dialogue reaches a consensus on holding free and fair elections.

"Ennahda is looking for an honorable exit from the crisis to avoid a fate like that of the Islamists in Egypt," said political analyst Noureddine Mbarki. "This decision comes after many international interventions, especially from Europe."

Both the Islamists and the opposition agree on the need for new voting once work on a long-delayed new constitution is completed, which could happen in the next few months. But the opposition does not trust Ennahda to hold a free and fair vote.

Ennahda, which governs in coalition with two smaller secular parties, is under increasing pressure from the opposition over accusations that is imposing an Islamist agenda, failing to deal with violent Salafi Islamists and mismanaging the economy.

SACRIFICES FROM ENNAHDA

The UGTT trade union federation, which is mediating between Ennahda and its critics, has proposed the government step down and let a neutral interim cabinet prepare new elections. Ennahda had rejected this in the past but changed course this week.

"The situation in the country demands sacrifices from Ennahda," UGTT chief Abassi said after the meeting, which came a day after he consulted with opposition parties on their stand.

"Ghannouchi has accepted the UGTT's initiative but he has a few conditions and propositions for starting the dialogue which we will present to the opposition," he said.

"We must find a way out of this crisis quickly because the country cannot wait. This could increase our economic difficulties," Abassi said.

Tunisia voted on October 23, 2011 for a constituent assembly which was to write a new constitution within a year, a deadline it failed to keep because of protracted wrangling between the Islamists and the secular opposition parties.

Four months were spent on debate just about whether to mention sharia, the Islamic legal and moral code, in the constitution. Ennahda finally agreed to leave it out.

SPECTRE OF EGYPT'S VIOLENCE

Critics say that although it was only supposed to be a transitional cabinet, the Ennahda-led body behaved as if it were a fully elected government and quickly filled many jobs in the national and local administration with Islamists.

Ennahda's turnabout came after the second killing of a leftist leader by suspected Islamist radicals in late July and the specter of the violence and bloodshed following the end of the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt.

Although talk of a possible coup made the rounds in Tunis last month, the Tunisian army - unlike its Egyptian counterpart - has no tradition of political intervention.

The million-strong UGTT (Tunisian General Labour Union) undertook its mediation effort because it is the only national organization that could press the parties towards a consensus.

headline: Italian coalition close to breaking point over Berlusconi fate
byline: By Barry Moody
7:26pm EDT

Relations between the partners in Italy's coalition government seemed close to breaking point on Thursday over whether to evict Silvio Berlusconi from parliament over a tax fraud conviction.

A row is raging between Berlusconi's center-right People of Freedom (PDL) party and the center-left Democratic Party (PD) of Prime Minister Enrico Letta following the 76-year-old media mogul's conviction by the supreme court early this month.

PDL sources said party secretary Angelino Alfano told Letta in a tense meeting on Wednesday night that the party would bring down the government if the PD voted in the Senate next month to throw Berlusconi out of parliament, something the center-left party has repeatedly said it will do.

Alfano said on Thursday he was very worried about the PD taking such a clear line before even hearing arguments in a Senate committee which begins meeting on September 9.

"We very clearly ask that the PD thinks about this, abandoning 20 years of hostility, and reflects on the wisdom of voting to remove Berlusconi," he said.

The PDL cites some legal experts as saying the anti-corruption law, under which Berlusconi would be expelled from parliament and prevented from standing as a political candidate, cannot be applied in this case.

But PD secretary Guglielmo Epifani said they wouldn't change their minds and the country could not afford a government crisis just as it starts to see the first tentative signs of recovery from its worst postwar recession.

Many PD members are up in arms over even sharing in a coalition with Berlusconi's party and any attempt to save their sworn enemy could break apart the already fractious center left.

"For us the compass is the interests of the country which come before our interests and even more so ahead of the interests of a single person," Epifani said.

Letta says the government must forge ahead to encourage economic recovery and Berlusconi's judicial problems are not an issue for his administration. "I will not accept blackmail and neither are ultimatums acceptable," he said on Wednesday night.

BERLUSCONI DESPERATE

Berlusconi is desperately trying to find a way to stay in the political game despite a four-year jail sentence, commuted to one year, for a massive tax fraud at his Mediaset broadcasting empire. He is expected to start serving the sentence, either under house arrest or doing social work, in mid-October.

Berlusconi, who has been holed up in his luxury villa near Milan since the verdict, has ordered his lieutenants to pile on the pressure in the hope of forcing the PD to at least delay any Senate judgment. His aides have unsuccessfully lobbied President Giorgio Napolitano for a pardon.

In an advance excerpts from a magazine interview published on the Internet on Thursday, Berlusconi said it would be the PD's fault if the government collapsed. "If two friends are in a boat and one throws the other overboard, whose fault is it if the boat sinks?" he told Tempi magazine.

"They cannot strip me of the right to speak on the political scene, they cannot strip me of the right to inspire and lead the political movement I founded, and they cannot take away my right to be the point of reference for millions of Italians," he said.

He added that he was sure his oldest daughter Marina, 47 and head of his $6.6 billion business empire, would not take his place at the head of the center right as has been suggested.

Despite the brinkmanship, analysts and doves in Berlusconi's party have warned that torpedoing the government could misfire, with the danger that Letta could form a new coalition with the help of PDL rebels and members of the populist 5-Star Movement of comedian Beppe Grillo.

Even if Italy went to early elections, Berlusconi would not be able to use his formidable campaigning power to the full and Letta has warned that Italians will punish anyone who causes a crisis at such a sensitive economic moment, only months after the government was formed.



headline: Syria struggles to tap frozen funds for food tenders
byline: By Maha El Dahan and Michael Hogan
7:26pm EDT

Syria's efforts to step up food purchases are being thwarted by sellers unwilling to risk delays in payments from frozen foreign bank accounts.

Civil war and a deepening humanitarian crisis have prompted the government of President Bashar al-Assad to issue a series of tenders for sugar, wheat, flour and rice in recent weeks.

The country needs to import around 2 million metric tons of wheat this year as civil war has sliced its crop to a near-30 year low at 1.5 million metric tons, less than half the pre-conflict average.

State buyers said payment for purchases via tenders would be made from the government's frozen accounts abroad with waivers obtained from countries that have imposed financial sanctions.

But international traders are showing little enthusiasm for the proposed payment system.

"This is too much of a big risk. The process of getting funds from the frozen accounts is too slow and complex to enable a rapid offer in a grain tender," one European trader told Reuters.

Food is not covered by international sanctions, but banking restrictions and asset freezes imposed by Washington and Europe, as well as civil war have made it difficult for some trading houses to do business with Damascus.

Seller reluctance was plain in Tuesday's wheat tender by Syria's General Establishment for Cereal Processing and Trade, or Hoboob, seeking 200,000 metric tons of wheat. Hoboob failed to make any purchase after receiving just two offers that it said did not meet specifications.

A sugar tender announced by Syria's state-owned General Foreign Trade Organisation (GFTO) for 276,000 metric tons of white sugar also closed on July 16 without a purchase.

The GFTO then announced another tender for the same amount which closed on August 13 in which payment could be made using frozen funds but only one offer was made. The organization is still looking into whether or not it will take the only offer made or cancel the tender.

BURDEN FOR TRADERS

Part of the problem with the new system, traders said, is that the government is putting responsibility for obtaining payment through frozen funds mostly on them.

Any release of payments through that method would require a series of permissions including the country in which the frozen bank account is located.

"That would involve too much of a headache for the seller and then the grains would end up being priced higher for the Syrian government," a Lebanese grain trader who does business with Damascus said.

Compounding the problem is the fact that terms for state tenders have not been revised to reflect the increasing political risk of dealing with Syria.

In Hoboob's recent tender for wheat, the organization was asking for a bid bond, or deposit, of 5 percent of the volume or a maximum of 1 million euros with offers expected to be valid for 7 days.

If traders had any later difficulties getting payment from frozen bank accounts and could not deliver the wheat, they would still face a payment of 1 million euros to Syria because of the bid bond, a risk seen as too large to take by some companies.

"The Syrians are still demanding the terms given to premium grains buyers rather than a country with among the highest levels of political risk in international trade. They have not relaxed their tender terms to reflect this," a second European trader said.

Some traders said they were waiting to find out how well the frozen funds payment system would work for others. Others said it was easier to trade in the private sector.

"It is much simpler, there are some problems that arise now of course in terms of getting the goods delivered because of the situation on the ground and we deal only in euros but it is easier to do business with the private sector rather than the government," the Lebanese trader said.

Should this method of payment fail to take off, Assad's government will need to find another way of securing the country's urgent food needs.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said last month that a fifth of Syria's population was unable to produce or buy enough food, and farmers were short of the seed and fertilizers needed to plant the next crop.



headline: I was framed, says China's Bo as he mounts feisty defense
byline: By John Ruwitch
6:20pm EDT

Fallen politician Bo Xilai put up a feisty defense on Thursday as he faced China's most political trial in decades, saying he was framed in bribery charges against him and had admitted to them under psychological pressure during interrogation.

The 64-year-old former Communist Party chief of the southwestern city of Chongqing has been charged with illegally taking almost 27 million yuan ($4.41 million), corruption and abuse of power and will almost certainly be found guilty.

Bo's denial of the charges and strong language as he made his first public appearance since being ousted early last year were unexpected. But observers said he could have agreed to choreographed proceedings that would show authorities in an impartial light in exchange for a pre-arranged sentence.

President Xi Jinping is seeking unstinted support from the party as he seeks to push reforms that will rebalance the economy, and will want Bo's trial to be finished quickly and with a minimum of fuss.

"He (Bo) is clearly going along with this trial," said Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher for New York-based Human Rights Watch. "The outcome has been already decided. There's probably an agreement already between Bo and the party as to what the outcome will be."

Bo's downfall has pitted supporters of his Maoist-themed egalitarian social programs against the capitalist-leaning economic road taken by the leadership in Beijing, exposing divisions within the ruling party as well as Chinese society.

Bo was one of China's rising political stars and his trial in the eastern city of Jinan marks the culmination of the country's biggest political scandal since the 1976 downfall of the Gang of Four at the end of the Cultural Revolution.

Television pictures showed a somber-looking, clean-shaven Bo, whose hair looked like it was still dyed black, in the dock without handcuffs. He was wearing a long-sleeved white shirt and stood with his hands crossed in front of him, flanked by two policemen.

Foreign media were not allowed to attend the trial and Bo's remarks were carried on the court's official microblog, so are likely to have been edited. Still, the transcripts provided by the court mark a level of openness that is unprecedented for a trial in China.

"Regarding the matter of Tang Xiaolin giving me money three times, I once admitted it against my will during the Central Discipline Inspection Commission's investigation against me," Bo said, referring to the party's top anti-graft body.

"(I'm) willing to bear the legal responsibilities, but at that time I did not know the circumstances of these matters: my mind was a blank," he added.

"MAD DOG"

Bo was charged with receiving about 21.8 million yuan ($3.56 million) in bribes from Xu Ming, a plastics-to-property entrepreneur who was a close friend and is in custody, and Tang, the general manager of Hong Kong-based export company Dalian International Development Ltd, the court said.

Bo called Tang "a mad dog" who wanted to "frame me out of consideration for his own interests".

"This evidence has little to do with my criminality," Bo said. "I was just hoodwinked. I thought it was all official business."

Bo said he had previously admitted taking some bribes from both Xu and Tang as he had been "under psychological pressure" during the party's earlier investigation against him.

But Bo denied receiving the 21.8 million yuan from Xu or knowing of a villa in France that Xu, who was in court, said he helped buy for Bo's wife, Gu Kailai.

"I am completely unaware of the property in Nice in France. The entire process is fabricated," Bo said.

Some of the funds from Xu and Tang were given to Gu and the couple's son, Bo Guagua, the court said, citing both the indictment and Xu himself.

It was the first time that authorities had named the younger Bo in the case against his father. Guagua is now in the United States, pursuing a law degree at Columbia University, and was not immediately available for comment.

Tang's whereabouts are unclear. A secretary at Dalian International's office in Hong Kong said she had not seen Tang since May or June last year. There was also no one at his last known residential address in Hong Kong.

Written evidence from Gu was provided to the court in which she said she had seen a large amount of cash in safes at two of their residences, money which matched the amount allegedly given to Bo by Tang.

Bo said that testimony was "laughable".

KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY

"He knows exactly what to say and what not to say," said Zhang Sizhi, who defended Mao Zedong's widow Jiang Qing during the Gang of Four trial in 1980. "It seems some sort of understanding was reached ahead of time."

Bo's trial will last for two days and the verdict is likely to be in early September, state broadcaster CCTV said.

Court spokesman Liu Yanjie said Bo was "emotionally stable and physically healthy" during the trial.

The Jinan Intermediate Court said on its microblog feed that five of Bo's family members attended the hearing. In another picture published by the court, Bo's siblings appeared to be in court. The court said over 100 people filled the courtroom.

Underscoring popular support for Bo, a handful of supporters protested outside the courthouse for a second day to denounce what they said was politically motivated persecution. Police, who had blocked off the courthouse, hustled them away.

Bo also embezzled 5 million yuan from a government project in the northeastern city of Dalian, where he served as mayor, the court said.

The charge of abuse of power against Bo relates to the murder case involving Gu, the court said. Bo was a rising star in China's leadership circles when his career was stopped short last year by the scandal involving Gu, who was convicted of the November 2011 murder of British businessman Neil Heywood, a business partner and family friend.

Bo's former police chief in Chongqing, Wang Lijun, has also been jailed for trying to cover up the case. Bo was furious with Wang when he was told that his wife was a murder suspect, and sacked him despite not having party authority to do so, sources with knowledge of the case have said.

Neither did he report the matter to his bosses in Beijing, all of which led to the abuse of power charge, they said.

Bo could face the death sentence, though a suspended death sentence is more likely, which effectively means life imprisonment, or a 20-year term.

His guilt is an almost foregone conclusion given that prosecutors and courts come under Communist Party control.

headline: South Africa faces strike wave as labor strife widens
byline: By Sherilee Lakmidas and Ed Stoddard
7:26pm EDT

South Africa faced a strike wave across leading sectors of the economy on Thursday and the labor unrest threatened to hit its struggling gold industry, already squeezed by rising costs and falling bullion prices.

Despite appeals from President Jacob Zuma and other government leaders for peaceful wage negotiations in Africa's largest economy, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said its members in the construction sector would down tools from Monday.

The NUM was also consulting its membership on a strike in the gold industry, which could start next week following an impasse in salary talks with mining companies.

Although South Africa has fallen in the world ranking of gold producers, gold remains its main mineral export and the industrial action, including an auto industry strike already underway, will inflict more damage on the struggling economy.

Violent wildcat strikes in the mining industry last year cost billions of dollars in lost output, dented economic growth, and led to damaging downgrades of South Africa's credit rating. More than 50 people died in protests at the mines.

The strife has also battered the rand, which dropped to a new four-year low against the dollar early on Thursday.

"We trust that working together, all parties will cooperate and see value in promoting lasting labor peace in our crucial mining sector," Zuma said on Thursday.

He was addressing a gathering of the 85,000-member SACTWU textile workers' union, which is also considering a strike.

Increasing wage claims and militancy among workers struggling to make ends meet as their living costs rise, are a major problem for Zuma's African National Congress (ANC) government before elections scheduled for next year.

It faces accusations that since apartheid ended in 1994, Nelson Mandela's liberation movement has paid more attention to the interests of a wealthy elite than to the country's workers, unemployed and poor.

Trade Minister Rob Davies recognized "a deteriorating labor relations environment, rooted in deep inequalities, rooted in insecurities arising from changes in the fortunes of the mining industry, insufficient career pathing, high levels of worker indebtedness".

"All of this, we think, has created a situation where there are very high wage demands and a loss of patience with more moderate negotiating frameworks," he said in Cape Town.

Kevin Lings, chief economist at Stanlib, said more strikes would frighten away potential investors and increase the cost of international borrowing for South Africa, if they led to further credit downgrades.

"Overall, it has already done South Africa quite significant damage and obviously ongoing strike action will continue to undermine the ability of South Africa to prosper," he told Reuters.

GOLD STRIKE COULD START WEDNESDAY

The NUM represents about 64 percent of the roughly 140,000 miners in the South African gold industry, where major operators include AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony and Sibanye Gold.

The opposing sides in the gold sector remain far apart after the weeks of talks, with virtually no narrowing of the gap between the unions and employers, whose latest offer was a 6 percent wage increase for some categories.

The NUM, which is seeking a 60 percent increase, walked out of the talks along with a smaller union UASA and applied for what is known in South Africa as a "certificate of non-resolution" from the government mediator, which was granted. This effectively allows them to strike.

"The earliest we will issue companies with notice of the strike is Monday next week," NUM spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said.

With such notice normally being given 48 hours before any action, this meant a stoppage in the gold industry could start on Wednesday.

The NUM's more hardline rival, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) which represents about 17 percent of the gold labor force, has submitted wage demands as high as 150 percent, but is still engaged in negotiations.

A membership turf war between NUM and AMCU was behind last year's mine violence.

The stoppage in the construction sector which has already been announced would affect major companies such as Wilson Bayly Holmes Ovcon, Aveng Ltd and Group Five Ltd.

South Africa's faltering economy is already losing an estimated $60 million a day to a strike by 30,000 workers in the car manufacturing sector that accounts for 6 percent of gross domestic product.

This strike entered its fourth day on Thursday and has affected global firms operating in South Africa, including Toyota, Ford and General Motors.

In the gold sector, companies are being squeezed between growing worker militancy which has pushed up wage costs and falling bullion prices.

Labor accounts for over 50 percent of costs and gold's spot price is 30 percent lower than the record peak of over $1,920 an ounce it reached almost two years ago. About half of the country's shafts are losing money at these levels, the industry says.

held suburbs of Damascus, and it accused the world of turning a blind eye to such attacks.

"The world condemns, the world investigates, the world pays lip service," Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Israel Radio.

"Nothing tangible or significant has been done in the past two years to halt (President Bashar al-) Assad's incessant massacre of his citizens," he said.

Opposition activists have accused Assad's forces of gassing hundreds, including women and children, in Wednesday's attack, allegations which government officials deny.

Echoing remarks made by Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon on Wednesday, Steinitz said that according to "Israeli intelligence assessments", chemical weapons had been used in the rebel-held eastern Damascus suburbs, and "not for the first time" in Syria's civil war. He did not provide further details.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on Thursday the international community needed to respond with force if the allegations of a Syrian government chemical attack proved true, although there was no question of sending troops on the ground.

Israeli leaders, while pointing a finger at Assad's forces over alleged chemical attacks, have stopped short of urging Western military intervention in the Syrian conflict.

Israel has on several occasions taken action of its own, firing into Syria after mortar bombs and shells from battles near the frontier struck inside the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel captured the Golan from Syria in a 1967 war.

For Israel, the conflict in its northern neighbor is a battle between two evils: Assad - who is allied with two of its most strident foes, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas - and Islamic jihadists fighting with rebels to oust him.

In his remarks, Steinitz focused on the Iranian part of the equation, saying Western sanctions already in place over Tehran's suspected quest for atomic weapons should be strengthened with punitive steps over its support for Assad.

Iran denies that it is seeking nuclear arms and says it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes.

"If Assad is using chemical weapons and massacring his people, Iran is responsible because Assad is today a total offshoot of Iran. Without Iranian support he would not manage to hold on," Steinitz said, citing arms supplies and funding.

Yisrael Katz, Israel's transportation minister, said the alleged horror of gas attacks on Syrians resonated strongly in the Jewish state, founded after the Nazi Holocaust in which many of the six million Jewish dead were killed in gas chambers.

Israel has long conducted a national gas mask distribution program for the civilian population. It has accused Syria of stockpiling chemical weapons and voiced concern they could be transferred to Hezbollah or other hostile groups.

"Today he (Assad) is murdering his own people, tomorrow he will threaten us and perhaps worse," Katz told Israel Radio.



headline: Pakistan army says soldier killed by Indian fire in disputed Kashmir

5:56pm EDT

The Pakistani army said one of its soldiers was killed on Thursday in "unprovoked" Indian fire along the border dividing the disputed territory of Kashmir, in the second such incident within two days.

A series of clashes that began this month has undermined a push by Pakistan's new civilian government to improve ties with old rival India, although Pakistani officials say they are still hoping to hold talks.

A security official said the soldier was killed near Rawalakot in the Poonch district, about 130 km (81 miles) from the capital, Islamabad, "due to unprovoked Indian firing".

The violence came two weeks after the killing of five Indian soldiers along the so-called Line of Control that separates the two sides in the Himalayan region.

India said the five were killed by Pakistani forces but Pakistan denied involvement and the government has issued a series of conciliatory statements.

"Pakistan will also continue to seek dialogue and resolution of all outstanding issues with India peacefully," the Pakistani government said in a statement on Thursday.

"The ceasefire should be maintained in letter and spirit. All military and diplomatic channels should be used to prevent ceasefire violations," it added.

The nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars since 1947, two of them over Kashmir. Both control a part of the Muslim-majority region but claim it in full.

A truce along their Kashmir border has held for nearly a decade, even though it has been broken every now and then by tit-for-tat artillery fire and an occasional cross-border ambush.

India has faced an insurgency in its part of Kashmir since 1989 and has long accused Pakistan of supporting the militants fighting Indian rule.

Pakistan denies arming the militants, saying it only offers moral support to the Muslim people of Kashmir, who are living under what Pakistan characterizes as harsh Indian rule.

Nevertheless, despite Pakistan's denials that it helps the militants, fighters have for years slipped from the Pakistani side of Kashmir into the Indian side to battle Indian forces.

India says this year it has seen a spike in attempts by militants to infiltrate into its part of Kashmir.

Many analysts expect the trend to continue as the two countries jostle for influence in Afghanistan, from which a NATO force is preparing to withdraw by the end of 2014.

Each nation fears the other is trying to install a proxy government in Kabul.



headline: Tunisian Islamists accept union plan to resolve crisis
byline: By Tarek Amara and Tom Heneghan
7:26pm EDT

Tunisia's governing Islamists edged closer to negotiations with secular opponents on Thursday by agreeing in principle to a plan for a transition toward new elections proposed by the powerful trade unions.

The birthplace of the Arab Spring revolts, Tunisia is struggling to defend its nascent democracy against political polarization and mass protests, especially after Egypt's army ousted another elected Islamist leader, Mohamed Mursi, in July.

Rached Ghannouchi, chairman of the Islamist Ennahda party, said negotiations would quickly resolve the standoff that has paralyzed Tunisian politics for almost a month and led to major protests and calls for the government to resign.

"We will get out of this crisis very soon," Ghannouchi told journalists after meeting UGTT Secretary General Hussein Abassi. "We accept the UGTT initiative in principle to begin the dialogue" with the opposition.

Both the Islamists and the opposition agree on the need for new voting once work on a long-delayed new constitution is completed, which could happen in the next few months. But the opposition does not trust Ennahda to hold a free and fair vote.

Ennahda, which governs in coalition with two smaller secular parties, is under increasing pressure from the opposition over accusations that is imposing an Islamist agenda, failing to deal with violent Salafi Islamists and mismanaging the economy.

SACRIFICES FROM ENNAHDA

The UGTT trade union federation, which is mediating between Ennahda and its critics, has proposed the government step down and let a neutral interim cabinet prepare new elections. Ennahda had rejected this in the past but changed course this week.

"The situation in the country demands sacrifices from Ennahda," UGTT chief Abassi said after the meeting, which came a day after he consulted with opposition parties on their stand.

"Ghannouchi has accepted the UGTT's initiative but he has a few conditions and propositions for starting the dialogue which we will present to the opposition," he said.

"We must find a way out of this crisis quickly because the country cannot wait. This could increase our economic difficulties," Abassi said.

Opposition parties in the North African state declined to comment immediately on Ghannouchi's statement.

Tunisia voted on October 23, 2011 for a constituent assembly which was to write a new constitution within a year, a deadline it failed to keep because of protracted wrangling between the Islamists and the secular opposition parties.

Four months were spent on debate just about whether to mention sharia, the Islamic legal and moral code, in the constitution. Ennahda finally agreed to leave it out.

SPECTRE OF EGYPT'S VIOLENCE

Critics say that although it was only supposed to be a transitional cabinet, the Ennahda-led cabinet behaved as if it were a fully elected government and quickly filled many jobs in the national and local administration with Islamists.

Ennahda's turnabout came after the second killing of a leftist leader by suspected Islamist radicals in late July and the specter of the violence and bloodshed following the end of the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt.

Although talk of a possible coup made the rounds in Tunis last month, the Tunisian army - unlike its Egyptian counterpart - has no tradition of political intervention.

The million-strong UGTT (Tunisian General Labour Union) undertook its mediation effort because it is the only national organization that could press the parties towards a consensus.

headline: Britain is a more modest military power, new defense chief says
byline: By Belinda Goldsmith
7:26pm EDT

Britain should have lower expectations of its military power because government spending cuts mean it will not be able to fight every potential war it faces, the new head of its armed forces said.

The European Union's biggest military spender is grappling with cuts which some of its top brass, as well as allies such as the United States, fear will make it difficult for it to fight another war on the scale of those in Afghanistan or Iraq.

In his first interview since becoming Prime Minister David Cameron's most senior uniformed military adviser, General Nicholas Houghton cautioned that the former imperial power needed to reassess its military might in an uncertain world.

"We have to recalibrate our expectation of the level of capabilities we can field on new operations from a standing start," Houghton, chief of the defense staff, told the Ministry of Defense's in-house magazine, Defense Focus.

"We've got to get back into an ‘expeditionary mindset' where we will not have perfect capability for every scenario."

He said no decision had been made for British troops to get involved in Syria, though he said military planners had provided options for the use of military force in the country, where President Bashar al-Assad is battling a two-year-old rebellion.

With military spending of $61 billion, Britain was the world's fourth largest spender after the United States, China and Russia in 2012, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

But Britain's Conservative-led coalition government has cut military spending in an effort to reduce the biggest budget deficit since World War Two.

Cuts of at least 20,000 jobs in the British army will eventually bring it down to 82,000 - a level one British lawmaker said was the lowest since the Napoleonic Wars.

COLD WAR

General Peter Wall, the head of the British army, warned in June that more spending cuts would be dangerous and seriously damage the country's chances of success in future wars.

Cameron, whose coalition came to power in 2010, says the government has been forced to make some difficult decisions on the military but that Britain has very strong armed forces which are well equipped.

Since the end of the Cold War in 1991, British military spending has fallen from around 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year to about 2.6 percent in 2010/11 and 2.3 percent for 2012/13.

Houghton, who replaced General David Richards last month, acknowledged it would be challenging to cut staff, keep people motivated and continue to run operations, but he said it was not an impossible task.

"Delivering defense in a period of austerity concentrates the mind on where genuine efficiencies lie, and it provides the catalyst for reforms which were long overdue," he said.

The general will also oversee the winding down of the British mission in Afghanistan where he was chief of joint operations in 2006 when British forces began operations in the south of the country.

The forces are due to leave the country by the end of 2014 with nearly half expected to pull out this year after more than a decade of conflict that has cost the lives of nearly 450 British troops.

"While everything we've invested in Afghanistan in terms of blood and treasure and effort over the past 12 years has helped transform the security situation, the enduring outcome for Afghanistan still sits in the balance," he said.

headline: Assange's Wikileaks runs into Australian election troubles
byline: By James Grubel
6:20pm EDT

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange's plans to capture a seat at Australia's September 7 elections were in disarray on Thursday after his top local candidate quit due to an internal fight over party organization.

Assange, who remains holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, accepted responsibility for the divisions, saying he had been too busy helping fugitive former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia.

"I made a decision two months ago to spend a lot of my time on dealing with the Edward Snowden asylum situation, and trying to save the life of a young man. The result is over delegation," Assange told Australian television on Thursday.

"I admit and I accept full responsibility for over delegating functions to the Australian party while I try to take care of that situation."

Assange has been given political asylum by Ecuador, but faces immediate arrest and extradition to Sweden to face accusations of rape and sexual assault if he leaves Ecuador's London embassy.

Assange has set up the Wikileaks Party in Australia and is running for a seat in the Senate upper house on a platform of transparency of information and protection of human rights.

Polls show his party is unlikely to attract the 17 percent of the vote needed to win a Senate seat -- including "preference" ballots from other parties under Australia's complex proportional voting system.

If he did win, he would need to return to Australia or his party would hand the seat to the second candidate on its list, Leslie Cannold.

But Cannold has now quit the Wikileaks Party, saying it was undemocratic and suggesting other candidates might also resign.

"As long as I believed there was a chance that democracy, transparency and accountability could prevail in the party I was willing to stay on and fight for it," she said in a letter of resignation received by Reuters.

ANGER OVER "PREFERENCE" DEALS

The dispute stems from the way the Wikileaks Party decided to distribute its preferences to other parties in the election. Under Australia's electoral system, losing Senate parties direct their votes to other like-minded candidates, boosting their chances of winning a seat.

But in two states, the Wikileaks Party has given its preferences to far-right parties ahead of strong supporters the Greens, sparking anger inside the party.

The Wikileaks Party said it would review its preference deals. But the preference arrangements had to be lodged with the Electoral Commission last week and it is now too late to make any changes. It is also too late for Cannold to be removed from the ballot papers.

Assange said Cannold did not discuss her concerns with him before announcing her resignation.

"During the night, this whole kerfuffle broke out in Australia. I wasn't aware of it until this morning. Leslie didn't speak to me to address any concerns," he told ABC television from London. "Part of the problem here is the teething problems of a young party."

headline: South African labor unrest spreads, gold, construction strikes loom
byline: By Sherilee Lakmidas and Ed Stoddard
7:26pm EDT

South Africa's labor unrest widened on Thursday as tens of thousands of construction workers prepared to down tools next week and unions in the gold sector also signaled their intention to call a strike over wages.

The escalating industrial action spelled more trouble for Africa's largest economy, which was hit last year by a wave of violent wildcat strikes in the mining sector that cost billions of dollars in lost output, dented growth, and triggered damaging sovereign credit downgrades.

The labor strife has also battered the rand, which dropped to a new four-year low against the dollar early on Thursday after wage talks in the gold sector stalled and the main mine union said it planned to ask members to vote on a strike.

National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said the union would be consulting its gold industry members over strike action in the next few days.

"The earliest we will issue companies with notice of the strike is Monday next week," he said.

With such notice normally being given 48 hours in advance of any action, this meant that a stoppage in the gold industry, which is the country's biggest export earner, could start on Wednesday.

NUM represents about 64 percent of the roughly 140,000 miners in the South African gold industry, where major operators include AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony and Sibanye Gold.

Seshoka also announced that NUM's 90,000 members in the construction industry would go on strike from Monday.

"It's over wages, we could not agree on wages. We have been in negotiations for three months now," he said.

The construction stoppage would affect major companies in the sector including Wilson Bayly Holmes Ovcon, Aveng Ltd and Group Five Ltd.

South Africa's faltering economy is already losing an estimated $60 million a day to a strike by 30,000 workers in the car manufacturing sector that accounts for 6 percent of gross domestic product.

The auto strike entered its fourth day on Thursday and has affected global carmakers operating in South Africa, including Toyota, Ford and General Motors.

In the gold sector, companies are being squeezed between growing worker militancy over wage claims that have added to costs, and falling bullion prices.

Labor accounts for over 50 percent of costs and gold's spot price is 30 percent lower than the record peak of over $1,920 an ounce it reached almost two years ago.

About half of the country's shafts are losing money at these levels, the industry says.

held Damascus suburbs, killing men, women and children as they slept.

With the death toll estimated between 500 and 1,300, what would be the world's most lethal chemical weapons attack since the 1980s prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in New York.

The council did not explicitly demand a U.N. investigation of the incident, although it said "clarity" was needed and welcomed U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon's calls for a prompt investigation by the U.N. inspection team in Syria, led by Ake Sellstrom.

drafted statement submitted to the council, seen by Reuters, was not approved. The final version of the statement was watered down to accommodate objections from Russia and China, diplomats said. Moscow and Beijing have vetoed previous Western efforts to impose U.N. penalties on Assad.

Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi said the allegations were "illogical and fabricated". President Bashar al-Assad's officials have said they would never use poison gas against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assad's forces have used small amounts of sarin before, hence the current U.N. visit.

Immediate international action is likely to be limited, with the divisions among major powers that have crippled efforts to quell 2 1/2 years of civil war still much in evidence.

Russia backed up Syrian government denials by saying it looked like a rebel "provocation" to discredit Assad.

Britain voiced the opposite view: "I hope this will wake up some who have supported the Assad regime to realize its murderous and barbaric nature," Foreign Secretary William Hague said on a visit to Paris.

France, Britain, the United States and others called for an immediate on-site investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors who arrived in the Syrian capital only this week. Moscow, urging an "objective" inquiry, said the very presence of that team suggested government forces were not to blame.

U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assad's forces a "red line" that in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous, smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate.

U.S. Senator John McCain, a Republican critic of Obama's Syria policy, said on Twitter that failure to penalize previous gas attacks had emboldened Assad: "No consequence for Assad using chemical weapons &amp; crossing red line," he said. "We shouldn't be surprised he's using them again."

laid on the floor of a clinic with no visible signs of injury. Some showed people with foam around their mouths.

The United States and others said it had no independent confirmation that chemical weapons had been used. The U.N. chief, Ban, said the head of the inspection team in Damascus was already discussing the latest claims with the government.

'SLEEPING DEAD'

Opposition activists cited death tolls ranging from about 500 to - by one account - some 1,300 after shells and rockets fell around 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. In 1988, 3,000 to 5,000 Iraqi Kurds were gassed by Saddam Hussein's forces at Halabja.

One man who said he had retrieved victims in the suburb of Erbin told Reuters: "We would go into a house and everything was in its place. Every person was in their place. They were lying where they had been. They looked like they were asleep."

Doctors interviewed described symptoms they believe point to sarin gas, one of the agents Western powers accuse Damascus of having in an undeclared chemical weapons stockpile.

An opposition monitoring group, citing figures compiled from clinics in the Damascus suburbs, put the death toll at 494, with 90 percent killed by gas, the rest by bombs and conventional arms. The rebel Syrian National Coalition said 650 people died.

Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma, Zamalka and Jobar during a fierce pre-dawn bombardment by government forces. The Damascus Media Office said 150 bodies were counted in Hammouriya, 100 in Kfar Batna, 67 in Saqba, 61 in Douma, 76 in Mouadamiya and 40 in Erbin.

A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility, Bayan Baker, said: "Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupils constricted, cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims."

Extensive amateur video and photographs appeared on the Internet showing victims choking, some foaming at the mouth.

A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies, many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries.

Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic. A voice-over said they were members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies.

Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons, and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas, sarin and VX nerve agents.



headline: Chinese court shows first picture of ousted politician Bo Xilai
headline: Ousted Chinese politician Bo Xilai denies one bribery charge against him
headline: Flamboyant Chinese princeling faces final indignity
byline: By Ben Blanchard
3:59pm EDT

The writing was perhaps already on the wall for Bo Xilai, the controversial former top official of China's southwestern city of Chongqing, when he appeared at last year's parliamentary meeting, alternately chastened and combative.

In earlier annual sessions of parliament, Bo had swept in, all smiles and lanky grace, preceded by a wave of TV cameras and popping flashbulbs. This time he was uncharacteristically restrained.

Bo rolled his eyes at repeated questions from foreign reporters about a scandal involving then-vice mayor Wang Lijun, and the normally effusive state media and parliament delegates kept their distance.

Wang, who doubled as the city's police chief before his downfall, went to ground in the U.S. Consulate in nearby Chengdu in February last year until he was coaxed out and placed under investigation.

"I certainly never expected this," Bo said of Wang's flight. "I felt that it happened extremely suddenly."

News of his own change of fortune came just as suddenly.

A few days after his news conference in March last year, a terse report from the official Xinhua news agency announced that Beijing had sacked Bo from his post, all but snuffing out his chances of rising to the top echelons of the Communist Party.

Now the end appears imminent for Bo, 64, whose long-awaited trial on charges of corruption, accepting bribes and abuse of power opened on Thursday, when he is certain to be found guilty by the Communist Party-controlled court.

Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, and Wang were jailed last year over China's biggest political scandal in years, which stems from the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in November 2011, a crime for which Gu was convicted.

After first helping Gu evade suspicion of poisoning Heywood, Wang hushed up evidence of the murder, according to the official account of Wang's trial. In late January 2012, Wang confronted Bo with the allegation that Gu was suspected of killing Heywood. But Wang was "angrily rebuked and had his ears boxed".

After Bo was sacked, he disappeared from public view and has not had a chance to respond publicly to the accusations against him.

Sources told Reuters in February that Bo was refusing to cooperate with the government investigation, had staged hunger strikes and had refused to shave to protest against what he saw as his unfair treatment.

But he later began cooperating with authorities, the sources said last month.

"FREE OF REGRETS"

As the outspoken Chongqing party chief, Bo had mounted a daring bid for the nation's top political body, the party's Politburo Standing Committee.

He captured national attention with a crackdown on organized crime and corrupt police officers in Chongqing, China's teeming wartime capital, and brought about stronger economic growth. But he also alienated political peers.

The anti-mafia campaign netted thousands of people and tapped into popular anger over the corruption and collusion that has accompanied China's economic boom.

"Fighting organized crime is for the sake of letting the people enjoy peace and creating a clean social environment in Chongqing," Bo said at his parliamentary news briefing, defending his record.

"We are sure of ourselves and free of regrets."

Bo, a former China commerce minister and mayor of the northeastern port city of Dalian where he wooed foreign investors, once had a flair for the dramatic.

His directness and independent streak impressed foreigners but annoyed peers, who prefer to rule through backdoor consensus and often stilted slogans.

Analysts have noted that no one in the top leadership had publicly praised Bo or the crackdown on organized crime.

Then-Premier Wen Jiabao told his annual news conference last year that Chongqing's leadership should reflect on the Wang Lijun incident, and also obliquely criticized Bo's drive to revive songs and culture from the heyday of Mao's Communist revolution.

Bo is a son of late vice-premier Bo Yibo, making the younger Bo a "princeling" - a child of an incumbent, retired or late national leader.

His wife was a lawyer and their son, Bo Guagua, was educated at an expensive, elite British private school and then Oxford University. The younger Bo's Facebook photos from parties caused their own Internet stir in China.

While wooing investors, Bo also envisioned low-cost housing for rural poor and migrant laborers, designed to appeal to then-President Hu Jintao's goal of creating a "harmonious society".

He called his vision "Peaceful Chongqing." It included text messages with Maoist slogans, singing old-style revolutionary songs by civil servants, who also had to adopt poor families and staff petition offices where citizens can complain.

But Bo had difficulty shaking off the suspicion of some critics, both inside and outside the country, that he was more concerned with his own rise than that of China.

headline: Divisive, dramatic case of China's Bo Xilai comes to trial
byline: By John Ruwitch
7:26pm EDT

Police blocked entry to a courthouse in the eastern Chinese city of Jinan on Thursday where the trial of ousted politician Bo Xilai is to open, the final, dramatic chapter of the country's most politically charged case in more than three decades.

A convoy of police cars and a minivan entered the courthouse around 7.10 a.m. (6.10 p.m. EDT), possibly carrying Bo. Police lined roads leading to the courthouse and blocked its two gates.

Dozens of journalists stood in a box that was cordoned off for the media across the street.

Bo, 64, will appear in public for the first time in 17 months when the court opens at 8:30 a.m., where he will face charges of bribery, corruption and abuse of power. He will almost certainly be found guilty.

His trial marks the culmination of China's biggest political scandal since the 1976 downfall of the Gang of Four at the end of the Cultural Revolution.

Bo's fall has been highly divisive, pitting supporters of his Maoist-themed egalitarian social programs against the capitalist-leaning economic road taken by the leadership.

President Xi Jinping, who is embarking on an ambitious plan to rebalance the world's second-biggest economy, will be keen to quickly put the trial behind him and ensure he has the unstinting support of the ruling Communist Party.

How Bo pleads to the charges will be keenly watched.

A guilty plea would almost certainly signal he has worked out a deal for leniency, but he's likely to plead not guilty to the abuse of power charge in an apparent bid to show that he is a victim of a power struggle, according to a source with ties to the leadership.

Bo, the party chief in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, was a fast-rising star in China's leadership circles when his career was stopped short last year by a murder scandal involving his wife, Gu Kailai. Gu was accused, and later convicted, of the November 2011 murder of British businessman Neil Heywood, a business partner and family friend.

Bo's former police chief in Chongqing, Wang Lijun, has also been jailed for trying to cover up the case. Bo was furious with Wang when he was told that his wife was a murder suspect, and sacked him despite not having party authority to do so, sources with knowledge of the case have said.

Neither did he report the matter to his bosses in Beijing, all of which helped lead to the abuse of power charge, they said.

Bo has also been charged with corruption and bribery, which state media says relates to his time in northeastern China, including a period as mayor of the city of Dalian.

Nevertheless he has been seen by his backers as the victim of a power struggle. Bo's downfall has triggered heated debate between his leftist followers, who are nostalgic for the revolutionary ideals of the Mao Zedong era, and reformers, who advocate faster political and economic change.

"I think it is very clear for Chinese people so far that Bo Xilai is the loser of a power struggle but he did something right at least for the people of Chongqing and Dalian, so he still enjoys quite high popularity among certain sectors of the Chinese populace," said Bo Zhiyue, a professor of Chinese politics at the National University of Singapore.

"That makes the whole trial very, very difficult."

ILLEGAL TRIAL

On Wednesday, a handful of his supporters protested outside the courthouse in Jinan to denounce what they said was politically motivated persecution.

"When comrade Bo Xilai was put under house arrest, it was a violation of the party charter and when he was handed over to the justice system it was a violation of the constitution," said a protester from Chongqing surnamed Li.

"This trial is illegal. We don't believe in any outcome of this trial."

Bo could face a death sentence for his charges, though it is more likely he could be given a suspended death sentence, which effectively means life imprisonment, or a 20-year term.

The trial, likely to last only a single day, will be closely watched as a test case of China's commitment to the rule of law, especially whether Bo will be given a chance to defend himself.

Yet his guilt is an almost foregone conclusion given that China's prosecutors and courts come under Communist Party control and courts have a 98 percent conviction rate.

Analysts say Bo's trial could have started only after he cooperated with the authorities, but how he will behave in court will be a question mark.

"Bo Xilai may not be as cooperative as his wife and you can't have a completely secret trial," said Cheng Li, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "I don't know how the leadership will handle that dilemma."

The new administration of President Xi, who formally took the reins of state power in March, will likely trumpet Bo's case as a success in its fight against deep-rooted corruption.

Xi has vowed to fight both "tigers" and "flies" - in other words people at every level of the party - as he combats graft so serious that he has warned it threatens the Communist Party's very survival.

Bo has not been able to respond to the accusations against him. In March 2012, at a news conference days before his dismissal, Bo scorned as nonsense unspecified accusations of misdeeds by his wife and said people were pouring "filth on my family".

off that threatens his fragile coalition, but positions remained "distant", a government source said.

Berlusconi's conviction for tax fraud has shaken the stability of the left-right coalition, with the former prime minister's People of Freedom (PDL) party demanding guarantees for his political future.

Letta and PDL Secretary Angelino Alfano held tense talks for almost three hours on Wednesday evening, but failed to reach any agreement on how to proceed regarding Berlusconi.

"In terms of the Berlusconi question, the meeting did not go well. Positions remain distant," the government source said, adding that some progress was made towards a deal on property tax reform.

PDL leaders have presented a list of demands to Letta as the price for their continued support of an awkward coalition of traditional rivals, forced to rule together to end months of post-election stalemate in April.

In autumn, Berlusconi, a four-time prime minister, faces a vote in the Senate on whether to remove him from parliament and prevent him from standing for election.

The 76-year-old billionaire recently relaunched Forza Italia, the party that first swept him to victory in 1994. His allies are lobbying hard to guarantee his freedom to campaign, desperate to protect a charismatic leader who has dominated Italian politics for almost two decades.

The PDL wants Letta's center-left party to give an earlier signal of how it plans to proceed in the vote, and Alfano warned Letta on Wednesday that the PDL would not be able to stay in a coalition with a party that votes to eject its leader from parliament, PDL sources said.

Letta believes the matter is now firmly up to parliament and not something his Cabinet can get mixed up in, the government source said.

While tension remained high at the meeting, some progress was made on plans to reform an unpopular property tax, another issue that has strained the coalition.

The government source said there was now hope an agreement on the IMU levy on primary residences, which Berlusconi's party wants abolished, will be found at a Cabinet meeting next week.

Earlier on Wednesday, Letta said Italy needed political stability so that the economy could recover after its longest postwar recession, adding he was confident the government's problems could be resolved.

"I am sure that everyone will do their part to get out of this difficulty, which I think can be overcome," he said during a visit to Austria.

headline: Close Cameron aides asked paper to destroy Snowden data
byline: By Andrew Osborn
7:26pm EDT

Two of British Prime Minister David Cameron's most senior aides pressed the Guardian newspaper to hand over or destroy intelligence secrets leaked by Edward Snowden, political sources said on Wednesday.

News that Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood and National Security Adviser Kim Darroch were involved drags Cameron into a storm over Britain's response to coverage of leaks from the fugitive U.S. intelligence contractor - a response that left even its U.S. ally talking of the importance of media freedom.

Cameron, on holiday in Cornwall, made no immediate comment.

The Guardian, media freedom activists and human rights lawyers say pressure on the paper over the Snowden material and the separate detention of the partner of a Guardian journalist on Sunday represented an assault on independent journalism.

The government says its intelligence agencies act within the law and that the Snowden leaks, which revealed U.S. and British surveillance of global communication networks, threaten national security. The United States has brought espionage charges against Snowden, who has found temporary asylum in Russia.

Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said on Tuesday that he had been approached weeks ago by "a very senior official claiming to represent the views of the prime minister" and by "shadowy Whitehall figures", a reference to London's government district.

Rusbridger said he had been told the paper would face legal action if it refused to destroy or hand over data from Snowden.

Later, two intelligence agents oversaw the destruction of hard drives at Guardian offices, but Rusbridger said this would not stop reporting as there were copies elsewhere in the world.

A White House spokesman said on Tuesday that it was hard to imagine U.S. authorities taking such action against a media organization, even to protect national security.

Several sources said Heywood and Darroch were among those who had contacted the paper. Heywood is Britain's most senior civil servant and Cameron's top policy adviser; Darroch is the prime minister's senior adviser on national security issues.

"The prime minister asked the Cabinet Secretary to deal with this matter, that's true," one source told Reuters.

"You won't be surprised to hear that (Darroch) also got involved with this," said another source.

Home Secretary Theresa May, the interior minister, defended the government's actions.

"I think issues of national security are rightly addressed at an appropriate level within government, and I do not find it surprising that someone at a very senior level within government should be involved in this particular issue," May told the BBC.

"STOLEN INFORMATION"

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the coalition with Cameron's Conservatives, said through a spokesman it was "reasonable" for Heywood to request that the Guardian destroy data that "would represent a serious threat to national security if it fell into the wrong hands".

"The deputy prime minister felt this was a preferable approach to taking legal action. He was keen to protect the Guardian's freedom to publish, whilst taking the necessary steps to safeguard security," Clegg's spokesman said.

Rusbridger's revelations about the phone calls from the heart of government and the destruction of data have amplified a controversy over the detention at London's Heathrow airport on Sunday of David Miranda, the partner of a Guardian journalist.

Miranda, a Brazilian who was in transit from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro, was held for nine hours under an anti-terrorism law before being released without charge minus his laptop, phone and memory sticks.

He is the partner of Glenn Greenwald, a Rio-based American who has led the Guardian's coverage of intelligence secrets leaked by Snowden. Miranda had been ferrying documents between Greenwald and a Berlin-based journalist contact of Snowden.

It was unclear what information the documents contained.

Gwendolen Morgan, Miranda's lawyer, said there would be a hearing at London's High Court on Thursday to rule on her request for an urgent injunction to prevent the British authorities from examining any data seized from her client or sharing it with anyone else.

"The purpose of these proceedings is to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive journalistic material that was seized," Morgan said in her request submitted to the court.

Public opinion is divided over the issue. A poll released by YouGov on Wednesday showed 66 percent of those asked supported the police having the powers that were used to detain Miranda, but 44 percent of respondents believed the law had been used inappropriately in his case.

"The picture of a country split down the middle extends to the actions of the Prime Minister and the Guardian over the hard drives containing Mr Snowden's information," YouGov said in a statement.

"43 percent thought Mr Cameron was right to instruct the intelligence agencies, via the Cabinet Secretary, to seek to recover the hard drives, while 40 percent think that either he should have stayed out of the decision or that the action was wrong whoever authorized it."

The pollster said the public was also split on whether the Guardian had been right to publish Snowden's information.

Brazil has said Miranda's detention had "no justification", while Miranda has launched a personal legal action against the police and the government, accusing them of abusing anti-terrorism powers to get hold of sensitive journalistic material.

Russia, a frequent target of British criticism over human rights, accused the British government of double standards in comments by a Moscow Foreign Ministry spokesman.

But May said: "It is the duty of government to protect the public, and it is absolutely right, if the police believe that somebody has in their possession highly sensitive stolen information that could help terrorists, that could lead to a loss of lives, it's right that the police should act."



headline: White House calls for U.N. probe of alleged Syria gas attack
byline: By Matt Spetalnick
7:26pm EDT

The White House on Wednesday called on the United Nations to urgently investigate allegations of massive deadly chemical weapons use by Syrian government forces, an attack which if confirmed could increase pressure on President Barack Obama to intervene in Syria's civil war.

Syria's opposition accused President Bashar al-Assad's loyalists of gassing hundreds of people near Damascus on Wednesday with rockets that released lethal fumes over rebel-held suburbs, killing men, women and children as they slept.

While the White House said it had no independent verification of the incident and was seeking additional information, it demanded that the Syrian government allow a U.N. team already in the country "immediate and unfettered access" to the location of the alleged attack.

The United States announced on June 13 that it would send military aid to Syrian rebels, saying Assad's government had crossed a "red line" by using chemical weapons in several small-scale attacks.

But even after the announcement, Obama has stuck to a cautious approach by authorizing only limited weapons shipments, showing little appetite for deeper involvement in Syria's 2-1/2 year-old civil war.

However, with the latest allegations putting the White House on the defensive, confirmation of a large-scale gas attack could add to pressure at home and abroad for a tougher line against Assad, who has defied Western calls to step aside.

"The United States is deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of Syrian civilians have been killed in an attack by Syrian government forces, including by the use of chemical weapons, near Damascus earlier today," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

"We are formally requesting that the United Nations urgently investigate this new allegation. The U.N. investigative team, which is currently in Syria, is prepared to do so, and that is consistent with its purpose and mandate," he said.

Earnest said that "if the Syrian government has nothing to hide," it would facilitate the work of the U.N. inspectors. "They must have immediate access to witnesses and affected individuals, and have the ability to examine and collect physical evidence without any interference or manipulation from the Syrian government," he said.

laid on the floor of a clinic with no visible signs of injuries. Reuters was not able to verify the cause of their deaths.

ASSAD EMBOLDENED?

The Syrian government denied it had used chemical arms, and Russia came to Assad's defense by saying the incident looked like a rebel "provocation" to discredit him.

Echoing Washington's earlier skepticism of such accusations against rebels, a U.S. official said: "We don't believe the opposition has the ability to use chemical weapons."

Unless U.N. inspectors gain access for an on-site investigation, it could take some time for U.S. officials to sift through photographs, video and intelligence to determine whether the Syrian opposition's reports are credible.

The earlier U.S. investigation of alleged Syrian chemical weapons use took months to conclude that Assad's forces had used small amounts of sarin gas in attacks during the previous year.

Obama's critics said Assad may have been emboldened by a failure to aggressively enforce the U.S. "red line" over chemical arms.

This adds to a growing perception of foreign policy troubles for Obama early in his second term. He is facing criticism for his inability to influence Egypt's generals in the country's political crisis and for failing to persuade Russia to extradite fugitive former spy agency contractor Edward Snowden.

"No consequence for Assad using chemical weapons &amp; crossing red line - we shouldn't be surprised he's using them again," Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, a frequent critic of Obama's Syria policy, said on Twitter.

Elliott Abrams, a Middle East adviser to former President George W. Bush and supporter of stronger backing for Syrian rebels, said the Obama administration was right to get the facts first before responding.

"But if they are what they appear to be - that is hundreds of people were killed in a chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime - then I think the president's going to have to do more than issue a statement," he said. "He called this a red line, and American credibility is now very much at stake."

The White House insisted, however, it would consult international partners and allies before deciding on any response. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke about the Syrian chemical weapons reports in a call with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, the Pentagon said.

headline: Divided Egypt prepares to release Mubarak from jail
byline: By Michael Georgy and Shadia Nasralla
3:59pm EDT

Deposed Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak could leave prison on Thursday after a court ruling that further divided a country in turmoil since the army toppled Islamist President Mohamed Mursi seven weeks ago.

Convening at the Cairo jail where Mubarak is held, the court ordered the release of the military man who ruled Egypt for 30 years with an iron fist until he was overthrown during the uprisings that swept the Arab world in early 2011.

The prime minister's office said he would then be placed under house arrest, which could be an attempt to placate the many who will object to the release of the man they held mass protests to eject in 2011.

Citing a security source, the state news agency said Mubarak would "likely" be transported to one of the state's vital installations or one of two military hospitals where he will be guarded under heavy security.

Mubarak, 85, was sentenced to life in prison last year for failing to prevent the killing of demonstrators. But a court accepted his appeal earlier this year and ordered a retrial.

The ailing former air force pilot probably has no political future, but the court ruling made some Egyptians uncomfortable.

"His regime was foul. He damaged the country a lot. Unemployment high, no services, no health, no education. This is not a good day for the country," said Hassan Mohamed, 66, an engineer.

Refilling juice cartons in a convenience store, Amr Fathi also expressed disappointment. "I'm not happy, of course. He oppressed us a lot back in the day," he said.

Political upheaval triggered by the army overthrow of Mursi has kept many Egyptians anxious for months.

The military announced a road map designed to bring democracy back to Egypt. But that has not created a sense of stability in the Arab world's biggest nation.

At least 900 people, including 100 soldiers and police, have been killed in a crackdown on Mursi supporters in the past week, making it the country's bloodiest internal episode in decades.

The clampdown, which has included the arrests of top leaders of Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood, appears to have weakened the Arab world's oldest and arguably most influential Islamist group.

It has been struggling to get people onto the streets to protest what it calls a military coup since security crushed pro-Mursi protest camps in Cairo.

Brotherhood supporters called on Egyptians to hold "Friday of Martyrs" marches against the military takeover.

A grouping calling itself The National Coalition to Support Legitimacy, which has been demanding Mursi's reinstatement, said in a statement, "We will remain steadfast on the road to defeating the military coup."

Mubarak's release from jail would reinforce the Brotherhood's view that the armed forces, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, is trying to rehabilitate the old government.

'HE WAS A GREAT MAN'

Mubarak is still being retried on charges of complicity in the killing of protesters during the revolt against him, but he has already served the maximum pretrial detention in that case.

The court ruling removed the last legal ground for his imprisonment in connection with a corruption case, following a similar decision in another corruption case on Monday. Mubarak will not be allowed to leave Egypt and his assets remain frozen.

Some Egyptians were happy to hear Mubarak could soon leave Cairo's Tora prison, where many of his enemies were jailed during his ruthless crackdowns on Islamists.

"He was a great man; he shouldn't be in prison. He is an old man," said Ibtisaam, 19. "Under Mubarak, we lived in safety. Now anyone can come up to us, thugs and all."

Egypt has witnessed a deterioration in law and order since Mubarak was toppled. Political violence that erupted after Mursi's ouster has also made Egyptians uneasy.

It is likely to drag on, with the authorities vowing to wipe out "terrorism", and the Muslim Brotherhood refusing to give up the fight to bring Mursi back to power.

The United States and the European Union are both reviewing aid to Cairo in light of the bloodshed, but Saudi Arabia, a foe of the Brotherhood, has promised to make up any shortfall.

The European Union stopped short of agreeing immediate cuts in financial or military assistance to Cairo on Wednesday, as the bloc's foreign ministers held emergency talks to find ways to help bring an end to violence in Egypt.

The decision acknowledges Europe's limited economic muscle in forcing Egypt's army-backed rulers and the Muslim Brotherhood supporters of Mursi into a peaceful compromise.

It also reflects a concern that abruptly cutting aid could shut off dialogue with Cairo's military rulers and damage Europe's ability to mediate in any future negotiations to end the worst internal strife in Egypt's modern history.

Egypt has said repeatedly it does not want foreign powers to interfere in the standoff with the Brotherhood.

"Egypt can never accept an interference in its sovereignty or the independence of its decisions or an interference in its internal affairs," said Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy in a statement after the EU talks.

"The only standard that rules Egypt's decisions is the supreme interest of the country and its national security."

byline: By Stella Dawson
7:26pm EDT

China has agreed to join the international effort by the Group of 20 leading economies to combat tax evasion by signing an agreement to share tax records, the OECD said Wednesday.

China's decision means that all G20 countries now have agreed to cooperate on tax avoidance, a priority set by global leaders to address the causes of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and to help combat corruption.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the global economic policy forum, said that Chinese Tax Commissioner Wang Jun will sign the convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters in Paris next week.

China recently has ramped up its efforts to crack down on corruption in the world's second-largest economy, arresting public officials on bribery charges, banning their elaborate expense-account dinners and investigating corporate activities.

Tax avoidance is frequently linked to corruption. Illicit funds, earned from crime, corruption and tax evasion, often are moved out a country via tax havens and by using shell companies. Sharing tax information can be an important tool in helping to track these funds.

Global Financial Integrity, a financial watchdog group, has estimated that more money flows out of China from illicit financial activity than any other developing country. Its latest report estimates the losses between 2000 and 2011 at $3.79 trillion.

headline: Fear returns to Egypt as state crackdown widens
byline: By Lin Noueihed
6:20pm EDT

year rule of Hosni Mubarak is creeping back into daily life, less than three years after the revolt that toppled him.

Ordinary people like Mohamed, who runs a tiny Cairo shop selling mobile phone accessories, now lower their voices if they oppose the army's overthrow last month of their first freely-elected president, Mohamed Mursi.

"It is about the principle that we stood in line and voted freely for the first time and this happens," whispered Mohamed, who declined to give his second name. "People who speak about justice now do not dare to say it out loud, in case people accuse them of being terrorists."

While activists critical of the army-backed government are obvious targets for intimidation, now ordinary Egyptians also avoid the noisy, boisterous discussion of politics that was common between the fall of Mubarak and that of his Islamist successor on July 3.

From mass arrests of Muslim Brotherhood leaders to the re-appearance of plain clothes enforcers on the streets of Cairo, a chill wind is blowing down the Nile.

Many Egyptians lambasted Mursi's Brotherhood for economic incompetence and trying to grab excessive power during his year in power. But now the language is much more serious: the government accuses the Brotherhood of "terrorism" as it tries to crush the movement by rounding up hundreds of leading members.

At least 900 people have been killed since security forces broke up two pro-Mursi camps on August 14. Allies of the Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest and best-organized Islamist organization, put the toll at 1,400.

A muted public response to Wednesday's court ruling that Mubarak should be released from jail has added to a sense that the authoritarian order is making a comeback, threatening the freedoms that were the main dividend of the uprising that began on January 25, 2011.

Media are now dominated by those backing the army's line that it removed Mursi in response to popular protests demanding his departure that began on June 30.

"I can sense, smell and very much tell that these are old Mubarak people coming to take their revenge on the Muslim Brotherhood," said Khaled Dawoud, a liberal who backed Mursi's overthrow but has since criticized the spread of violence.

"It is so obvious with the pro-Mubarak people who are filling the TV right now. They don't even want to consider January 25 a revolution. They say June 30 is the only revolution."

The Brotherhood, which kept large protest camps going for six weeks in Cairo to demand Mursi's reinstatement, is now struggling to get people out. There have been no major protests for days. The marches have fizzled out since Sunday when rumors spread that government snipers were posted on rooftops.

The authorities have tightened their grip with dawn-to-dusk curfews. The emergency rule that lasted throughout the Mubarak era is back, at least for a month. Police who melted away in the face of public anger in 2011 appear invigorated by the new political climate, paraded as heroes on state television.

WIDENING THE NET

As the authorities widen their net to include regional and lower-ranking Brotherhood members, other Islamist parties worry that their own members will be hauled in.

Younes Makhyoun, leader of the Nour Party which follows the puritanical Salafi approach to Islam, voiced concerned that the political security apparatus that once hunted religious groups and government critics will make a comeback.

Islamist movements, like any that tried to offer a serious alternative to Mubarak's military-backed party, were outlawed for decades. Like the Brotherhood, they were among the biggest beneficiaries of the 2011 uprising that allowed them to set up political parties and campaign openly for the first time.

Now, their members face citizen's arrests at the makeshift checkpoints that have sprung up around Egypt, manned by pro-government vigilantes. Some Egyptians recognize these as the pro-Mubarak "baltagiya", or thugs, who clashed with protesters during the 18-day revolt that ousted the former leader.

that they had weapons or were taking part in acts of sabotage," Makhyoun told Reuters.

"We need guarantees from the authorities to the Egyptian people: that the gains of the January 25 revolution cannot be violated, especially in the field of freedoms, human rights, and freedom of expression."

The crackdown on the Islamists has divided liberals in much the same way that it has polarized Egypt. Loath to endure Islamist rulers, elected or not, some liberals who joined the 2011 protests now side wholeheartedly with the army.

Egyptian state television has resumed its role as the mouthpiece of those in power. Channels emblazoned with banners reading "Egypt fighting terrorism" flicker on screens in Cairo's street cafes, in bakeries and in barber shops.

A recent poll by the Arab American Institute suggested a huge majority of Egyptians had confidence in the military.

It is far from uncommon to hear Egyptians, whose economy was brought close to bankruptcy by persistent instability, hark back to Mubarak's era as a time when they at least earned a living.

"The Brotherhood were a problem for this country. God has taken revenge on them," said Haj Abdelfattah, 71, smoking his waterpipe as he sat on a plastic chair and sold overripe fruit by the road. "They acted for themselves, not Egypt."

LIBERAL CRITICS FEEL THE HEAT

But some of the liberals who initially welcomed the army's move against Mursi have been dismayed by the ensuing bloodshed. The army has promised fresh elections but critics fear they will pay a political price for their opposition.

Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel peace prize winner and the most prominent liberal to endorse Mursi's overthrow, resigned as interim vice president early in the crackdown and left for Europe days later. He now faces a lawsuit raised by a private citizen who accuses him of "betrayal of trust".

This points to the prospect of a new wave of politically-motivated suits. Under Mursi, Brotherhood supporters had brought a series of cases against opposition figures, in what critics called a form of political intimidation.

By contrast, Mubarak is close to being freed with charges ranging from corruption to complicity in the killing of protesters so far failing to stick.

"I have not been sent to trial but I am getting enough charges of treason and defecting and jumping off board, and this is discomfiting talk," said Dawoud, who quit as spokesman for ElBaradei's National Salvation Front as the death toll rose.

Like ElBaradei, Dawoud has become something of a pariah in the ranks of his former brothers-in-arms in Tamarud, the youth movement that led the protests against Mursi and welcomed the army's intervention against him.

"Tamarud is finished ... They issue statements that call on the army to do even more," he said. "It is a major disappointment to me that some liberal and nationalist parties that had defended the goals of human rights and democracy... have suddenly decided to swallow this."

The backlash is such that critical journalists and broadcasters have been silenced or forced off the air. Government officials have railed against the foreign press, accusing it of sympathizing with the Brotherhood and underplaying attacks on churches and the deaths of police.

Some foreign correspondents say they have been beaten while out reporting or faced pressure from vigilantes accusing them of being spies.

Activists say their efforts to condemn the extensive nature of the arrests, or the deaths of 38 people in custody, have been met with accusations of political bias.

"There are fears or threats of arrest by loyalists of the former regime against the revolutionary youth and activists... The atmosphere of fear and terrorizing of activists who speak out about anything - this is widespread," said Mohamed Adel, media coordinator for the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights.

"Some big journalists... are being threatened and told you are either with us or with the enemy."

Sitting in his shop, worried about getting home before curfew, Mohamed sees only dark days ahead for Egypt.

"The barrier of fear is returning. It is coming back stronger than before. The police were humiliated after the January 25 revolution and they want to restore their authority... The excuse will be anti-terrorism, the same excuse Bashar al-Assad uses in Syria," he said. "We'll end up a jungle like Syria."

running dispute over the Falkland Islands "foolish".

In an effort to draw a line under the latest spat in an ill-tempered feud between the two countries over the South Atlantic archipelago, she said her words had been taken out of context.

"Ambassador Castro referred exclusively to the failure of a communication strategy," the ambassador said in a statement issued by the Argentine embassy. "They (the remarks) were not meant as a personal affront to Mr. Cameron, nor to the Prime Minister's office."

Earlier on Wednesday, Britain's foreign office had told Reuters it was seeking confirmation of the comments by Ambassador Alicia Castro, saying that, if reports of them were accurate, her words had been "undiplomatic".

The contested islands, known as Las Malvinas by Argentines, remain a source of tension between London and Buenos Aires more than 30 years after Argentina unsuccessfully invaded them in an attempt to assert its sovereignty claim.

Castro's comments had also ruffled feathers in Cameron's office. Referring to a referendum in March in which Falkland residents were asked if the islands should remain a British Overseas Territory, a source from Cameron's office had said: "We don't think it's foolish to listen to 99.8 percent of the population, who have made it very clear that they want to stay British."

On Tuesday, Castro had told Argentine lawmakers that Cameron had unwisely publicized comments about the Falklands by former Buenos Aires Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio, made before he was named pope earlier this year.

"Prime Minister Cameron was dumb, if I may use the word dumb before Congress," Castro said during a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pausing to laugh.

"When the pope was named I asked one of our people to look into what Bergoglio had said regarding the Malvinas. Cameron did the same and was foolish enough to disseminate the information," she added.

Cameron said in March that the pope had been wrong to say in 2012 that Britain had "usurped" the islands.

In April, Castro declined an invitation to attend the funeral of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who led Britain at the time of the 1982 Falklands war.

Memories of that conflict remain raw and Argentine President Cristina Fernandez has mounted a campaign to renegotiate the islands' sovereignty, lobbying Pope Francis on the issue and rejecting the results of the islands' referendum.

guided economic reforms crucial to rejuvenate sluggish growth.

The move, affecting 14 portfolios, left the key interior, finance and foreign ministers in place.

Political analysts say the new 23-member cabinet strengthens the role of technocrats at the expense of tribal figures who held sway in previous administrations.

This applied to most of the crucial service ministries such as water, planning, tourism, housing, information technology and transport, they said.

"It's a mainly technocratic cabinet without a political bent and with a priority to proceed with IMF-directed reforms and overhauling the subsidy budget," said Mohammad Abu Ruman, a leading political commentator.

Reform-minded Ensour, an economist educated in the United States and France who was reappointed to his post in March, was mandated by King Abdullah, to accelerate economic reforms seen as crucial to meet the U.S.-allied country's challenges.

Jordan has been hit by a financial crisis since the start of a wave of revolts elsewhere in the Middle East over the past two years as foreign aid fell due to economic problems in donor countries while welfare payments soared.

Jordan has seen street protests, which prompted the authorities to expand social spending and freeze fuel price hikes, but as the country came close to the brink of financial insolvency last year it signed a $2 billion locan deal with the IMF. The deal was conditional on budget tightening and unpopular cuts in fuel subsidies and hikes in electricity tariffs.

Ensour has faced criticism from the conservative establishment that dominates parliament, accusing him of a pro-Western reform agenda that promotes harsh IMF-dictated cuts in subsidies that will worsen the plight of lower-income households and the poor.

Independent politicians have praised Ensour's willingness to take bold measures in the face of popular resistance.

SUBSIDY CUTS

Ensour's decision last November to cut subsidies on most fuel products sparked violent protests. Jordan was spending nearly $2.3 billion annually on subsidies, almost a quarter of its annual budget.

The new cabinet is expected to continue a shift from broad subsidies towards targeted cash transfers to the poor to bring down the country's chronic deficit.

Finance Minister Umayya Toukan, who won praise from the IMF for the country's fiscal performance in the past year when it cut the deficit to 5 percent of gross domestic product from 7.5 percent in 2012, is a strong advocate of fiscal measures to reduce years of overspending by successive governments.

Economists say the deficit could reach as high as 10 percent without aid from Western donors and Saudi Arabia.

Officials say electricity tariffs will be increased early next year.

The kingdom's economy has been strained by a flood of refugees from the more than two-year-old civil war in its northern neighbor Syria.

Jordan has received around 500,000 Syrian refugees, equivalent to 7 percent of its own population, putting pressure on water and electricity resources.

However, in recent months there have been signs of economic recovery with foreign reserves boosted by at least $1.5 billion of Gulf money, pushing the reserves up to around $10.7 billion, and with investors showing rising confidence in Jordan's economy, officials say.

The economy grew 2.7 percent last year, low growth for a developing economy, and the IMF projects growth above 3 percent this year.



headline: Swedish politician wounded in Somali kidnap attempt
byline: By Abdalle Ahmed
7:26pm EDT

Somali gunmen tried to kidnap a Swedish opposition politician on Wednesday in an ambush in which she and another woman were wounded and two men were killed, police said.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility. However, al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militants have kept up guerrilla-style attacks and kidnappings in the city despite being largely pushed out by Somali and African forces two years ago.

Witnesses said Ann-Margarethe Livh, an opposition Left Party city councilor in Stockholm, was returning to her hotel after giving a speech at the University of Somalia when the gunmen struck near the Turkish embassy.

Student Ahmed Dek said she flung open the rear door of the car and ran under a hail of bullets towards the university. She was bleeding badly from her left side, he said.

Police said an officer guarding her and a man said to be her translator were killed. A Somali woman from Sweden was also wounded, they said.

Swedish media reported that a Swedish-Somali man from Stockholm was shot dead in the attack, citing sources. The Swedish Foreign Ministry said it was investigating the reports.

"Livh has a gunshot wound and is on her way out of the country. A group of party members that she is part of have been shot at," Left Party official Aron Etzler said.

Livh is the most prominent Left Party politician in Stockholm. A party spokeswoman told Sweden's TT news agency the group was in Mogadishu "in connection with an international project within the work of the Left Party".

KIDNAP ATTEMPT

Bile Ibrahim, of the criminal investigation department, said police were investigating an attempted kidnap.

"Our initial investigation shows that the attack was motivated by a kidnap of the white woman," Ibrahim told Reuters.

"The men were three to four, armed with AK47s and they blocked the road in front of the car which the white woman was on board. They begun to fire at the driver and the others. They did not want to kill her, but to kidnap her."

He said three university lecturers were being questioned.

The Swedish Foreign Ministry said Sweden's ambassador to Mogadishu has talked to Livh.

The ministry said preparations were under way to move her to Kenya after treatment in Mogadishu. A spokesman for the U.N. hospital there said her wounds were not life threatening.

Somalia has a new elected government that has been in charge for about a year and is attempting to rebuild itself after two decades of civil war and lawlessness, triggered by the overthrow of president Siad Barre in 1991.

Witnesses said the attack took place near where three people were killed last month when a car loaded with explosives rammed into an office housing Turkish embassy staff, killing three people. Al Shabaab claimed responsibility for that attack.

Wednesday's attack was on a feeder road that links to KM4, or kilometer 4, a busy junction in Mogadishu. During the height of the push by the African troops against al Shabaab, analysts said that whoever held KM4 controlled Mogadishu.

KM4 is a junction that leads to the airport, the seaport and to the presidential palace.

Last week, a medical charity that was a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Somalis announced it was pulling out of the country, saying the threat of deadly violence had become intolerable.

7:26pm EDT

At least 10 people were killed in clashes across the capital of the Central African Republic between supporters of its former president and the fighters who ousted him and seized power five months ago, officials said.

Newly sworn-in rebel leader Michel Djotodia is struggling to control the impoverished but mineral-rich nation, which has witnessed a string of violent power changes since independence from France in 1960.

Human rights groups accuse Seleka, the grouping of five rebel movements that brought him to power and ousted former President Francois Bozize, of abuses, looting and indiscriminate killings.

Officials in Bangui said the fighting on Tuesday started after Seleka fighters tried to disarm Bozize supporters in their Boy-Rabe stronghold in the riverside capital.

Rabe, security minister Noureldine Adam told Reuters on Wednesday.

"The young people have never come to terms with the change in the country, thus their hostility towards the new government," said Adam. "We want to put an end to all of this."

Some, including the Catholic archbishop of Bangui, have accused the rebels in power of brutality and indiscriminate killings.

"We cannot talk of trying to disarm when you shoot innocent people, loot and pillage peaceful citizens. We do not call that disarmament," Dieudonne Nzapalainga told Reuters.

Yvon Sanze, a high school student, said he witnessed Seleka fighters executing two men while he was hiding in a nearby bush during the fighting.

"I saw them arrest the two men who were trying to flee Boy-Rabe. The rebels forced the two to lie down in a ditch off the Independence Avenue and sprayed shots on them from their Kalashnikov," Sanze said.

"One of the two killed was a mathematics teacher."

A spokesman for the government declined to comment on the accusations by the archbishop and the student, saying it was still investigating the incidents.

Romain Guitinza, a director at a community hospital in Bangui, said seven dead and 17 wounded were recorded at the hospital from the fighting on Tuesday.

In Boeing, another neighborhood where fighting took place, General Moussa Assabarassoul, who led the Seleka troops, said two of his men and a woman had been killed during the fighting.

By Wednesday afternoon there was an uneasy calm in the capital, but residents said Boy-Rabe was empty as many resident had sought refuge elsewhere.

The United Nations said last week the country was on the brink of collapse and the crisis was threatening to spread beyond its borders.

The government of neighboring Cameroon, through which pass most supplies to land-locked Central African Republic, temporarily shut its border on Wednesday, saying Seleka rebels had killed a police officer at a border post 600 km (370 miles) from the Cameroon capital.

Seleka fighters had crossed into Cameroon on August 19 and spent the day drinking, Cameroon state radio reported. A dispute erupted before the shooting, it added.

headline: Pakistani seminary furious over U.S. 'terrorist' tag

Students and teachers at a Pakistani Islamic school designated as a "terrorist training center" by the United States furiously rebutted the charges Wednesday and said they had not had a chance to defend themselves against the accusations.

The U.S. Treasury imposed economic sanctions on the Ganj madrassa, or Islamic school, in Peshawar on Tuesday, saying it trained recruits and facilitated funding for al Qaeda, the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is accused by Indian intelligence of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

The sanctions include a ban on U.S. citizens having any dealings with individuals or assets linked to the school. The Pakistani Interior Ministry and army declined to comment on the decision.

The Treasury said Fazeel-A-Tul Shaykh Abu Mohammed Ameen al-Peshawari, known as Shaykh Aminullah, controlled the school. In 2009, both the U.S. and the United Nations accused him of providing material support to al Qaeda and the Taliban.

But 83-year-old Haji Alam Sher, who founded the school as a mosque more than two decades ago, denied this.

"He was just a regular prayer leader here but he left eight months ago and I've never heard of him again," Sher told Reuters angrily. "I condemn perpetrators of terrorism and would never support those carrying out suicide attacks."

The United States accuses the school of radicalizing students to conduct terrorist and insurgent activities and training them to become bomb manufacturers and suicide bombers.

Donations collected for the school were directed to terrorist groups such as the Taliban, which used the money to fund the ongoing violence in Afghanistan, the Treasury said.

But the school's principal said teachers focused on religion, not militancy.

"This is a religious school where purely religious knowledge is given to the students," Maulana Mohammad Ibrahim said.

The brown concrete school lies down a narrow street in the heart of Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, not far from Pakistan's tribal belt where Taliban-linked militants are ensconced.

Since the announcement of the seminary's designation, some residents are afraid that the U.S. might mount an attack. U.S. drone missiles have targeted militants in areas near the Afghan border since 2004.

"Some people are saying that US drones will now fire missiles to hit this madrassa," said resident Sabz Ali. "All of us are worried."

Assad fall from power.

General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the comments in a letter to a congressman seen by Reuters on Wednesday, in which he renewed his concerns about the limits of U.S. military power to steer events in Syria's war.

"We could, if asked to do so, significantly increase our effort to develop a moderate opposition," he wrote, without offering details.

However, Dempsey added in the response to a query from Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee: "Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides."

"It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor," Dempsey wrote. "Today, they are not."

The United States is providing non-lethal support to the opposition, but has been slow to make good on promises to deliver weapons to moderates.

Dempsey said the U.S. military could destroy Syria's air forces to impose a cost for Assad's "unacceptable behavior," and address on a far greater scale the humanitarian crisis stemming from Syria's conflict.

But he stressed that U.S. intervention would not be militarily decisive and would not extinguish the religious, tribal and ethnic tensions fueling the conflict.

Dempsey's letter came after a trip he made to Jordan and Israel that underscored the complexity of the conflict, in which Syria is becoming a magnet for foreign Sunni Muslim fighters seeking to join what they see as a holy war against Shi'ites.

Some in the U.S. Congress, including Engel, believe President Barack Obama must take more aggressive military steps in Syria, particular following reports of use of chemical weapons by Assad's forces.

Syria's opposition accused Assad's forces on Wednesday of gassing many hundreds of people - by one report as many as 1,300 - in what would, if confirmed, be the world's worst chemical weapons attack in decades.

"I reject the notion that our involvement in Syria would simply constitute â&euro;&tilde;choosing sides' between one armed group and another," Engle said in a statement, responding to Dempsey's letter.

"Rather, our involvement represents a choice between hastening the end of the Assad regime or continuing to allow the cycle of violence, displacement, and terror to continue unabated."

In comments to reporters after meeting leaders in Jordan and Israel last week, Dempsey did not signal interest from those allies for overt U.S. military action in Syria.

However, Amman asked Dempsey for manned surveillance aircraft to help keep watch on its long border with Syria, a request which follows U.S. moves to station F-16 fighter jets and Patriot missiles in Jordan. Dempsey said he would take that request back to Washington for consideration.

The men, women and children lying undisturbed in their beds had looked so peaceful they might have been just sleeping, Abu Nidal thought, as he and other rescuers dragged their bodies into the street.

His was one of many accounts of a massive assault on the eastern suburbs of Damascus that activists say killed more than 500 people on Wednesday morning. They say some of the bombs were loaded with chemical agent, which would make it the worst chemical attack since Syria's two-year conflict began.

"We would go into a house and everything was in its place, every person was in their place. They were lying where they had been. They looked like they were asleep. But they were dead," he told Reuters by Skype from the suburb of Erbin.

Some first responders found it surprising that either President Bashar al-Assad's forces or the rebels trying to topple him would carry out such an attack just days after a United Nations team arrived in the capital to inspect previous reports of chemical weapons use.

The U.N. investigators are staying in a hotel just a few kilometers away.

It has been difficult to confirm previous reports of chemical attacks or determine responsibility, with no experts able to examine the scene.

When shelling hit her town of Mouadamiya, southwest of the capital, Farah al-Shami ignored the rumors on Facebook that rockets were loaded with chemical agents. She thought her district was too close to a military encampment to be affected.

"And at the same time the U.N. was here. It seemed impossible. But then I started to feel dizzy. I was choking and my eyes were burning," the 23-year-old said, speaking by Skype.

"I rushed to the field clinic nearby. Luckily no one in my family was hurt, but I saw entire families on the floor."

Reuters was unable to verify witness accounts. Doctors interviewed in the area describe symptoms they believe point to sarin gas, one of the agents Western powers accuse Damascus of having in an undeclared chemical weapons stockpile.

The government denies having such weapons and says that if it did posses them, it would not use them against other Syrians. It repeated those statements again on Wednesday, calling the reports of the gas attack "fabrications".

SHOUTING WARNINGS FROM MINARETS

Videos uploaded from the suburbs of the rebel stronghold outside the capital, known as Eastern Ghouta, show similar scenes of small children convulsing on the floor, foaming at the nose and mouth. Some show rows of men, women and children - pale but with no signs of injury - laid out for burial.

Abu Nidal said the alleged chemical strike took some of the first responders by surprise, too, when the first round of rockets hit between 2:20 and 2:40 a.m.

"We saw men collapsed on staircases and in doorways. It looks like they were trying to go in and help and then were affected themselves. Some of them were dead," he said.

Within half an hour after the attack on Erbin, however, residents had passed on reports of apparent gas attacks nearby.

"Some of them passed the information on the loudspeakers from mosque minarets, saying towns like Ain Tarma and others were claiming chemical strikes."

Medics went house to house, he said, breaking down doors to check even homes that were not hit by the shelling to ensure there were no victims of the gas attack.

Majid Abu Ali, a doctor treating patients in the eastern suburb of Douma, said at least half of the people he treated were women and children who arrived in his clinic around 3 a.m.

"The injuries correspond with sarin gas," he said in an interview on Skype. "Difficulty breathing, heavy breathing, inability to breathe to the point of suffocation. Slowing of the heart reaching cardiac arrest, constricted pupils, perspiration, convulsions and loss of consciousness to the point of death."

By the time the rockets hit near Abu Omar, a doctor in Mouadamiya, he and his medics immediately prepared themselves with masks and plastic gloves.

But unlike previous attacks that left only a few dozen hurt or killed, he was taken aback by the numbers. Like many doctors, he said he treated hundreds on Wednesday. Of 120 he reported dead from the shelling, he said 50 were killed by gas.

"We didn't know what to do with them all so I started sending some of the injured to wait in the streets," he said, speaking from his clinic by Skype, his voice intermittently drowned out by the sound of artillery still pummeling the area.

Activists said the army had launched a fierce offensive, with repeated air and artillery strikes that have not let up since Tuesday night.

"I've had dozens of the rescuers hurt today, and nine killed. At first they were being affected by the gas," Dr. Abu Omar said. "But now they're dying in the regular shelling. The bombs just won't stop."



headline: Europe shies away from cutting aid for Egypt
byline: By Justyna Pawlak and John O'Donnell
7:26pm EDT

The European Union stopped short of agreeing immediate cuts in financial or military assistance to Cairo on Wednesday, as the bloc's foreign ministers held emergency talks to find ways to help bring an end to violence in Egypt.

The decision acknowledges Europe's limited economic muscle in forcing Egypt's army-backed rulers and the Muslim Brotherhood supporters of deposed President Mohamed Mursi into a peaceful compromise.

It also reflects a concern that abruptly cutting aid could shut dialogue with Cairo's military rulers and damage Europe's ability to mediate in any future negotiations to end the worst internal strife in Egypt's modern history.

The European Union, seen as more neutral than the United States, which provides aid to Egypt's military, has emerged a key player in Egypt since the army deposed Mursi on July 3. The new government allowed the EU's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton to become the first foreign official to see him in detention.

"The principles of our policy are to support democratic institutions, not to take sides," British Foreign Secretary William Hague told reporters after meeting his EU counterparts in Brussels.

"It is to continue to promote political dialogue and being able to maintain a position where we can continue to do that."

The ministers agreed to review any financial aid given to Egypt but said assistance to civil society would continue.

They also agreed to suspend exports to Egypt of any equipment that can be used for internal repression and review any arms sales, though stopping short of explicitly agreeing to end such trade.

"We want to continue to have a strong relationship with Egypt and to be able to offer our support, but we stand by the principles and values that we hold," Ashton told reporters after the meeting. "If we can be of assistance, we would do so."

Underscoring reluctance elsewhere in the West to take decisive action after violence in Egypt that has killed over 900 in the past week, the United States denied on Tuesday that any aid to Cairo has been cut but stressed that the army's bloody crackdown on protesters may influence their assistance.

Calls for tougher international action grew louder after the Egyptian authorities defied Western pleas for restraint and ordered the storming of camps of Mursi supporters in the past week.

AID LIMITS

Any European aid cuts would be tough to implement because the vast majority of its current assistance is directed at civil society groups and social programs.

Direct budget assistance from EU institutions was stopped last year, and a 5 billion euro ($6.7 billion) package of grants and loans pledged last year hinges largely on democratic and economic reforms, which are lacking.

Blunting any impact of western aid cutbacks, Saudi Arabia has also pledged to plug any shortfalls.

Several EU governments have already implemented some cuts in assistance but privately, diplomats said, some are expressing concern that removing all security assistance to Egypt could damage the authorities' ability to address Islamist attacks in the lawless north Sinai region.

Britain has already suspended some joint work with the Egyptian security forces and revoked licenses to export arms. Hague has said in the past the EU could not, however, rule out future assistance.

Egypt's main source of military assistance is the United States, which supplies its army with $1.3 billion a year, most spent to buy and maintain U.S.-made weapons.

Germany, one of the world's largest arms exporters, has provided millions of euros' worth of arms in recent years, though the government has stopped approving such sales since July.

7:26pm EDT

Tunisia's powerful UGTT trade union federation sought to mediate in the country's political crisis on Wednesday, consulting the secular opposition on its proposals for new elections before meeting with the ruling Islamists on Thursday.

UGTT Secretary General Hussein Abassi, whose million-strong federation gives him influence outside the feuding political camps, met leaders of the "Salvation Front" of opposition parties to inform them of recent overtures from the government.

He was originally also scheduled to meet with Rached Ghannouchi, chairman of the governing Ennahda party, on Wednesday, but the meeting was postponed a day with no official explanation.

"Things are still difficult," Abassi told journalists after meeting the parties demanding Ennahda resign. "The opposition is sticking to its demand to dissolve the government and form a caretaker cabinet."

Ziad Lakhdher, a leader of the Popular Front party, said Abassi had informed the meeting of Ennahda's latest offer for a government of national unity led by the present Islamist Prime Minister Ali Larayedh. "We reject this categorically," he said.

Tunisia's opposition has stepped up its pressure on Ennahda in recent weeks, angered by the murders of two leftist leaders this year and emboldened by the popular protest that led to the fall of Egypt's Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in July.

With no powerful military to intervene like in Egypt, the two sides are locked in a political standoff punctuated by mass street rallies of their supporters and a series of real and rumored contacts among envoys seeking a path to consensus.

"GET OUT" CAMPAIGN

Reacting to the mounting pressure, Ghannouchi unexpectedly flew to Paris last week to meet Beji Caid Essebsi, head of the largest opposition party Nidaa Tounes, who was on a visit there. He then held initial talks on Monday with Abassi.

Several opposition parties plan to call another round of street rallies this weekend in what they call their "degage" ("get out") campaign, using the same term chanted by protesters against former strongman Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.

The opposition accuses Ennahda of mismanaging the economy, ignoring violent Salafis trying to impose their Islamist rules on more secular Tunisians and delaying completion of a new constitution that was supposed to be ready last October.

It also says Ennahda, which won 41 percent of seats in the October 2011 vote for the constituent assembly, was supposed to be only a transitional leadership, but has filled many state jobs with Islamists as if it were a fully elected government.

Tunisia is due to hold new elections once the constitution is completed, but the opposition parties demand that Ennahda resigns before that because they say the Islamists cannot be trusted to oversee an impartial vote.

Abassi, who dislikes media comparisons of his Tunisian General Labour Union's power broker role with that of the army in Egypt, is not exactly an uninterested party in the negotiations. His UGTT has also called for Ennahda to quit.

That demand has become so widespread that even Ettakatol, one of the two smaller secular parties governing in the Ennahda-led coalition government, came out in favor of it on Sunday.

But Abassi does not support a second demand by many opposition parties for the slow-moving constituent assembly to also be dissolved, arguing it should instead be given a short deadline to wrap up its work before elections can be held.

headline: Yemeni government apologizes for wars waged by former president
byline: By Mohammed Ghobari
7:26pm EDT

The Yemeni government on Wednesday issued a public apology to southern separatists and northern Shi'ite Muslim rebels for wars waged against them during former President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule.

The apology, made in a cabinet statement read out on state television, comes amid national reconciliation talks launched in March to address grievances by large segments of the population. Delegates aim to chart major constitutional and administrative reforms ahead of national elections next year.

"The government apologizes for the war of the summer of 1994 and what the previous government did against the southerners, considering that a historic mistake that cannot be repeated," the statement said.

It also apologized to residents of northern Saada province over repeated military campaigns that Saleh's administration launched against rebels there between 2004 and 2010.

Civil war broke out between North Yemen and the former Marxist south in 1994, four years after the two countries merged into one state. Its consequences have fuelled secessionist demands for separation.

Southern Yemenis have long complained of discrimination by the North, including the dismissals of tens of thousands of people from state jobs, seizure of state assets and private property and the withholding of state pensions from families of soldiers killed in the conflict.

Saleh battled northern Shi'ite rebels seeking the restoration of the Zaidi imamate that ruled much of modern Yemen before it was overthrown in 1962. Thousands died in the fighting, which ended with a truce in 2010.

The statement said the apology was required under a deal brokered by Gulf states that paved the way for Saleh to step down in 2011 after months of unrest and hand the reins of power to his deputy, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

Fahmy al-Saqaf, a leader in the southern secessionist Herak movement, said the apology, though long overdue, was an important step.

"But what is more important is what comes after the apology, and what we fear is that the (reconciliation) dialogue ends without implementing southern demands," Saqaf told Reuters.

Herak representatives recently suspended their participation in the reconciliation talks, demanding that the government make good on promises to restore seized property and return sacked state employees to their jobs.

The reconciliation conference is scheduled to present final reports on proposed reforms next month.

Restoring stability to Yemen, a U.S.-allied country which shares a long border with Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, is an international concern after years of turmoil that has persisted despite Saleh's departure.

Gunmen killed two men and wounded two women, including a Swede, in Somalia's capital Mogadishu on Wednesday when they ambushed a car in what police believe may have been an attempted kidnap.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility. However, al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militants have kept up guerrilla-style attacks and kidnappings in the city despite being largely pushed out by Somali and African forces two years ago.

Witnesses said the Swede going back to her hotel after giving a speech at the University of Somalia when the gunmen struck near the Turkish embassy.

Student Ahmed Dek said the Swedish woman flung open the rear door of the car and ran under a hail of bullets towards the university. She was bleeding badly from her left side, he said.

A police officer guarding the Swedish woman and a Somali man said to be her translator were killed, police said. A Somali woman from Sweden was also wounded.

Bile Ibrahim, of the criminal investigation department, said police were investigating a possible attempted kidnap.

The Swedish Foreign Ministry confirmed a Swedish woman had been shot and injured and said it was investigating the circumstances of the attack.

The ministry said preparations were under way to move her to Kenya after treatment in Mogadishu. A spokesman for the U.N. hospital there said her wounds were not life threatening.

Somalia has a new elected government that has been in charge for about a year and is attempting to rebuild itself after two decades of civil war and lawlessness, triggered by the overthrow of president Siad Barre in 1991.

Last week, a medical charity that was a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Somalis announced it was pulling out of the country, saying the threat of deadly violence had become intolerable.

byline: By Tom Perry
7:26pm EDT

While security forces round up the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's second largest religious party has warned the state against trying to wipe out political Islam entirely during its toughest crackdown in decades.

The Nour Party, a Salafist group that backed the military's removal of President Mohamed Mursi last month, is now also feeling the heat, its leader Younes Makhyoun told Reuters.

Members of his pacifist party - which follows an austere interpretation of Islam - have been beaten, harassed and turned over to the police in recent days, simply because they wear beards as a sign of their religious observance, he said.

With at least 900 people killed in a week, Makhyoun cautioned against an arbitrary campaign targeting Islamists, saying this would drive some underground. "This will be a dangerous path and make many disavow the tools of democracy, and perhaps resort to other methods," he said in an interview.

Political Islam could not be "uprooted", he added. "If anyone is thinking about excluding it, that is of the utmost stupidity."

The Brotherhood's main rival, the Nour Party turned strongly against the much older Islamist group earlier this year, joining liberals who accused Mursi of staging a power grab.

When Mursi was overthrown on July 3, Nour endorsed an army-backed transition plan, lending Islamist support to the new order as the government promised an inclusive process. But the party began to distance itself from the government after dozens of Brotherhood supporters were gunned down by security forces.

Makhyoun, a dentist who took over the party leadership last year, said the government had to assure Egyptians that freedoms won by the uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak in 2011 would not be rolled back following the bloodiest week in Egypt's modern history.

"We need guarantees from the authorities to the Egyptian people: that the gains of the January 25 revolution cannot be violated, especially in the field of freedoms, human rights and freedom of expression," he said.

Head of a party born out of the uprising, Makhyoun described threats to freedom including a revival of the Mubarak-era political security apparatus as the state fights the Brotherhood, which ruled for a year until Mursi's fall.

Some Nour members, angered by events and agitated by Brotherhood rhetoric, had broken party ranks, he said, adding to indications that Egypt's established Islamist groups may be losing their grip on supporters.

Since the crackdown began, more than 1,000 Brotherhood activists including its leaders have been arrested while 100 members of the security forces have also died in the last week.

Makhyoun warned against violence and counter-violence at a time when arms have been freely available in neighboring Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi two years ago.

"Enormous quantities of weapons" had entered Egypt from Libya since 2011, he said. A compromise solution was now more complicated than ever but the only way out of the crisis, he added. "If Egypt sinks, it will sink with everyone aboard."

STATE SECURITY

The Nour Party, the most successful political newcomer after Mubarak's downfall, tried to take the middle ground in the last months of Mursi's rule. It tabled proposals for defusing political tensions and boycotted pro-Mursi rallies.

That reduced Mursi's allies to smaller Islamist parties including the Gamaa Islamiya, a once armed Salafist movement.

After Mursi's downfall, Nour exercised major influence in shaping the interim government, vetoing two candidates for prime minister. Analysts say the party has paid a price as its approach eroded its standing among some Islamists.

Makhyoun said the party had faced "enormous pressure" from its youth base to take part in the Brotherhood-led protests. It had been difficult to keep them in check as Mursi's allies used religious rhetoric to rally young Islamists.

"There was great difficulty in convincing them in this charged, emotional atmosphere," Makhyoun said. "There are some people who broke away - this is something natural," he said. "I am confident that when matters become clear, they will return."

Makhyoun traced the crisis to the violent language he said the Brotherhood and its allies had used on the eve of Mursi's downfall. Leaders of Gamaa Islamiya, which waged an insurrection in the 1990s against the state before joining the political process, had said Mursi's opponents should be crushed.

"We were accused of treachery: everyone who was against them was a traitor. This is difficult language and could take the youth to the path of violence, no doubt," he said.

Brotherhood activists involved in violence should be put on trial, he said. But "random arrests of all Brotherhood members is a mistake", he said.

Since Mursi's downfall, the Interior Minister has announced the revival of a political security apparatus, stirring fears that agencies used in Mubarak's days to suppress the opposition would be used against the Islamists.

Makhyoun listed that as one of his main concerns, together with the reimposition of the state of emergency, the closure of Islamist TV stations the day Mursi was toppled, and the mobilization of "thugs" by the state.

"There are checkpoints manned by thugs who specifically harass those with beards," Makhyoun said. "This has happened a lot to members of the Nour Party."

"People are asking us every day: 'What do you think? Has State Security returned again?" said Makhyoun. "We don't know their intentions - only God knows them - but what we can say is there are steps and signs that cause concern."

7:26pm EDT

Iran's envoy to the U.N. atomic agency will leave his post next month, in what may be a further sign of new President Hassan Rouhani's desire for a fresh start with the outside world over its disputed nuclear program.

Ali Asghar Soltanieh's surprise departure comes after Rouhani last Friday appointed former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, seen as a pragmatist, to head Iran's atomic energy organization, replacing a hardliner in the job.

Rouhani has pledged to improve Iran's ties with world powers in an attempt to ease stringent international sanctions on the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program, which it says is entirely peaceful but the West suspects has military aims.

Soltanieh, an energetic diplomat in his early 60s who often rails against the West in meetings of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), had been leading so far fruitless negotiations with the agency.

"I confirm that my mission, assignment, will be over on September 1," nuclear physicist Soltanieh told Reuters on Wednesday. "I'm proud that I've served my country and I'm grateful for their trust and I will go back home of course to serve my country."

It was not immediately clear whether his move was planned or was a more recent decision by Tehran.

One Western diplomat accredited to the IAEA said Soltanieh "was the face" in Vienna of the previous Iranian government and that his replacement may be another indication of Rouhani seeking a new atmosphere in Tehran's international dealings.

"If the president wants a new dynamic maybe he needs a new person" as ambassador to the U.N. agency, the diplomat said.

NEW START

Meanwhile, the appointment of Salehi - also a former ambassador to the IAEA - was seen as a further signal that Rouhani intends to pursue a more flexible approach to Iran's nuclear dispute with the West than his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a hardliner.

IAEA chief nuclear inspector Herman Nackaerts, Soltanieh's counterpart in the talks, is due to retire next month, meaning both sides may enter any new round of discussions with new chief negotiators. The next meeting has yet to be scheduled.

There was also no word yet on who would replace Soltanieh, who has held the job for some seven years, diplomats said.

The IAEA has for years been investigating allegations that Iran has carried out research and tests relevant for the development of nuclear weapons, a charge the country denies.

Western diplomats have accused Iran of stonewalling the IAEA's inquiry, and Tehran's relations with the U.N. agency have become increasingly strained in recent years.

One European diplomat said Soltanieh still seemed to have cordial personal relations with IAEA officials in talks that got under way in early 2012 on what the U.N. agency calls the "possible military dimensions" to Iran's nuclear program.

"He is skilled and knowledgeable," the diplomat said.

Rouhani is still deciding who will lead broader diplomatic talks with world powers on Iran's nuclear program, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, more than two months after the moderate cleric was elected.

The Iran-IAEA talks are separate, but still closely linked, to the negotiations between six major powers and Iran aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to the decade-old dispute and avert the threat of a new Middle East war.

Western states and Israel say Iran's atomic energy program is in fact an attempt to attain a nuclear weapons capability. Tehran denies the charge and says it only wants the technology to generate electricity and for medical research.

7:26pm EDT

Palestinian Islamist group Hamas urged Egypt on Wednesday to reopen the border crossing with the Gaza Strip that was closed after a suspected militant attack on Egyptian policemen near the frontier earlier this week.

Hamas, an off-shoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, has ruled Gaza since 2007 and has an uneasy relationship with Egypt's new army-backed leadership, which toppled elected President Mohamed Mursi, a Hamas ally, last month.

Cairo has accused Hamas of interfering in Egyptian affairs and suggested that Palestinians might be helping Islamist militants active in the Sinai peninsula, where 25 policemen were killed in an ambush on Monday.

The Egyptian army, which has long been suspicious of Hamas, has also clamped down on smuggling tunnels that run underneath the desert border between Egypt and Gaza.

"The Palestinian people, the people of Gaza, must not pay the price for any problems or differences inside Egypt," said Ghazi Hamad, deputy foreign minister of the Hamas-run government in the territory.

Mursi's ouster was seen as a major blow to Hamas, especially as the group's ties with traditional allies Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah party have also suffered because it sided with the rebels in the uprising against their one-time friend, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Thousands of Palestinians, including students and patients seeking medical treatment, have been unable to travel to Egypt since the Rafah border crossing was shut.

Hundreds of Palestinians have also been stranded outside the Gaza Strip by the upheaval that has shaken Egypt since the military ousted elected President Mohamed Mursi on July 3 after mass protests against the Muslim Brotherhood leader's rule.

"Gaza people have enough problems. This crossing should be named the crossing of humiliation and not Rafah," said Mai Jarada, a business student in Tunisia who attended a wedding in Gaza and now cannot leave the Palestinian enclave.

Some 1,200 Gaza residents used to enter Egypt daily before Mursi's ouster, but the figure has dropped to only 300 since he was deposed.

At Rafah, the main window to the world for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the Israeli-blockaded Gaza Strip, several dozen people waited in vain on Wednesday to cross the border into Egypt's Sinai.

Citing security concerns, Israel allows only a limited number of people to travel through its own passenger crossing with the Gaza Strip.

At a news conference on Wednesday, Hamad rejected accusations by some Egyptian officials that Hamas, an Islamist group that is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, had intervened on Mursi's behalf during violence in Egypt.

At least 900 people, including 100 soldiers and police, have been killed in a crackdown on Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood in the past week, the bloodiest civil unrest in Egypt's modern history.

In a sign of concern over any spillover of anti-Islamist activity into the Gaza Strip, Ismail Haniyeh, prime minister in the Hamas government, made reference at a public event to a YouTube video that urged Palestinians in the territory to rebel against Hamas's leadership on November 11.

The video showed four masked men, who identified themselves as members of the "Tamarud (Rebellion) of Palestine". One of the men said Palestinians' "patience has run out" and Hamas "will not govern us after November 11".

Haniyeh, in his public remarks, said: "I support rebellion against the Zionist enemy. Such a language must not be used among us."

Hamas, which won a general election in 2006, seized the Gaza Strip from forces loyal to Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement in 2007. Egyptian-brokered unity talks have failed to lead to reconciliation between the two groups.

shunned officials of Tunisia's old order have returned to the political scene and are turning up the pressure on the governing Islamist party Ennahda to make way for them.

These so-called "remnants" from Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali's rule were swept aside by the first of the "Arab Spring" revolts in January 2011 and trounced in voting for a constituent assembly later that year. The assembly has considered banning them from politics completely.

But two murders of leftist leaders this year by suspected radical Salafis and mounting dissatisfaction with Ennahda's Islamist agenda have plunged Tunisian politics into turmoil, prompting the assembly to suspend its work.

Since the second assassination in late July, ex-officials regrouped in new political parties have spoken out more openly and helped organize and fill the ranks of mass rallies to demand Ennahda step aside and allow new elections.

It now looks likely that the proposed ban, which would shut about 30,000 "remnants" out of politics, will get lost in the political tumult and the opposition parties will emerge as a potentially strong challenger to Ennahda in the next election.

"The ex-officials want to return under another flag," said Tunis University professor Sami Brahmi, referring to about half a dozen parties where they are active. "They're the ones who are benefitting the most from what is happening."

Ennahda used to dismiss the "remnant" parties as a copy-paste of the old system and not worth talking to, but agreed to meet them after Egypt's ruling Muslim Brotherhood was toppled by the army last month following mounting popular protests.

One major beneficiary is Beji Caid Essebsi, who was briefly parliament speaker under Ben Ali and interim prime minister after he was ousted. Opinion polls give his party some 30 percent support, about equal with the Islamists.

His pivotal role in solving Tunisia's crisis was confirmed last week when Ennahda chairman Rached Ghannouchi made a secret trip to Paris, where Essebsi was on a visit, to hold his first talks with the man the Islamists had until then shunned.

Essebsi "has well and truly taken the role of master of ceremonies," commented analyst Sofiane Ben Farhat.

Another beneficiary is Kamel Morjane, defense and then foreign minister from 2005 until 2011. His party, smaller than Essebsi's, is the most active in defending former officials of Ben Ali's now banned Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD).

PRAGMATIC SECULAR MODERNISERS

The widely-used term "fuloul" (remnants in Arabic) is political shorthand for the pragmatic secular modernizers who worked as technocrats under Ben Ali and were not tainted by corruption or human rights violations during his rule.

About a dozen of Ben Ali's closest collaborators were jailed on charges of corruption and abuse of power soon after his ouster. He escaped to Saudi Arabia with his family.

Egyptians also speak of "fuloul" from the Mubarak years, but the army that deposed former President Mohamed Mursi is the main counterweight to the Islamists for power there.

With Tunisia's non-political military staying firmly in its barracks, the real challenge to Ennahda comes from the secular opposition parties and the powerful Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT), another strong critic of Ennahda.

Essebsi's Nidaa Tounes, for example, includes former members of Ben Ali's RCD and leading businessmen from pre-revolution days, as well as progressive modernizers and trade unionists.

Its platform on its website stresses democracy, jobs, social welfare and economic progress, goals the Islamists' critics say Ennahda has failed to reach. It makes no mention of Islam.

Essebsi's new role was clear to see on Monday when Tunis newspapers ran a photograph showing him receiving a stiffly smiling Ghannouchi at his hotel in Paris.

The picture was published alongside articles reporting that Ennahda, which until then had refused to consider their demands, was now ready to meet its critics without preconditions.

Parties defending the former officials have also formed wider tactical anti-Islamist "fronts" with left-wingers who struggled against Ben Ali.

Jilani Hamammi of the Workers Party, the former underground communist party, saw no problem working with "remnants" in a broad anti-Ennahda "Salvation Front".

"We are ready to work with anyone who can stop this religious dictatorship," he said.

The RCD was dissolved after Ben Ali was ousted in 2011 and the leading parties of the ex-officials, such as Essebsi's Nida Tounes (Call of Tunisia) or Morjane's Initiative, sprang up. Ennahda was banned under Ben Ali and legalized after he fell.

PROUD OF HIS PAST

In another come-back twist, Hamed Karoui, Ben Ali's prime minister from 1989 to 1999, was recently called in by President Moncef Marzouki to hear his views on solving the crisis.

Karoui has been contacting fellow "Destourians", followers of the secular modernizer Habib Bourguiba, who led Tunisia to independence from France in 1956 and ruled until 1987.

Mohamed Jegham, head of the Al Watan (The Nation) party and one of many "remnants" in it, made no apologies for his past.

"I worked with Ben Ali for 13 of the 23 years he was in power. I am proud of the contribution I made to the construction of this country," said Jegham, who was defense and foreign minister in the 1990s and briefly commerce minister in 2011.

Noting the development of infrastructure, industry and education before 2011, he asked: "Who did all this? It was us."

Jegham, whose party has linked up with others in the Destourian Front, said the anti-Islamists learned an important lesson in 2011. "There were about 125 parties running in that election and they split the vote. We cannot continue like that."

The Pakistani military said on Wednesday one of its officers had been killed in "unprovoked" firing by Indian troops across the border in the disputed Kashmir region but an Indian official said his side had only responded to initial Pakistani fire.

The incident was the latest in a series of clashes that began this month which has undermined a push by Pakistan's new civilian government to improve ties with old rival India.

A Pakistani military official said that as well as the officer killed, a soldier was seriously wounded in the "unprovoked Indian shelling".

The violence came two weeks after the killing of five Indian soldiers along the so-called Line of Control that separates the two sides in the Himalayan region. India said the five were killed by Pakistani forces but Pakistan denied involvement.

The nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars since 1947, two of them over Kashmir. Both control a part of the Muslim-majority region but claim it in full.

A truce along their Kashmir border has held for nearly a decade even though it has been broken every now and then by tit-for-tat artillery fire and the occasional cross-border ambush.

An Indian army official said Indian troops came under heavy mortar and light-machine gun fire from the Pakistani side on Tuesday night in the Kargil region, where the two sides fought an undeclared war in 1999.

The Kargil region had been peaceful since then until shooting began again last week.

"Under intense pressure ... we fired back," the Indian official said.

India has faced an insurgency in its part of Kashmir since 1989 and had long accused Pakistan of supporting the militants fighting Indian rule.

Pakistan denies arming the militants, saying that it only offers moral support to the Muslim people of Kashmir who are living under what Pakistan criticizes as harsh Indian rule.

EYES ON AFGHANISTAN

Nevertheless, despite Pakistan's denials that it helps the militants, fighters have for years slipped from the Pakistani side of Kashmir into the Indian side to battle Indian forces.

India says that this year it has seen a spike in attempts by militants to infiltrate into its part of Kashmir.

Many analysts expect the trend to continue as the two countries jostle for influence in Afghanistan as a NATO force prepares to withdraw by the end of 2014.

Both nations fear the other is trying to install a proxy government in Kabul.

Pakistan's government, elected in a May general election, has tried to be conciliatory over the latest outbreak of border violence.

On Monday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who made better ties with India a theme of his election campaign, said Pakistan and India should be fighting poverty and illiteracy instead of each other. He has also asked for talks with Indian officials.

But with elections approaching in India, many doubt that the government in New Delhi is in a position to make any concessions to Pakistan.

Hamid Gul, a former chief of Pakistan's military intelligence agency, told Reuters Television that Sharif had been prepared to reach out to India in the hope of mending ties before the spate of clashes put paid to that.

"It would've meant putting Kashmir on the back burner for the time being. But now all this has happened. And all the lobbies that have been talking about peace between India and Pakistan ... have been scuttled," Gul said.

old civil war.

Reuters was not able to verify the accounts independently and they were denied by Syrian state television, which said they were disseminated deliberately to distract a team of United Nations chemical weapons experts which arrived three days ago.

The U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and army forces used poison gas in the past, one of the main disputes in international diplomacy over Syria.

Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma, Zamalka and Jobar before dawn.

A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility, Bayan Baker, said the death toll, as collated from medical centers in the suburbs east of Damascus, was 213.

"Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupil dilated, cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims," the nurse said.

Extensive amateur video and photographs purporting to show victims appeared on the Internet. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies, many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. About a dozen were wrapped in blankets.

Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic, with no visible wounds. The narrator in the video said they were all members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies.

A photograph taken by activists in Douma showed the bodies of at least 16 children and three adults, one wearing combat fatigues, laid at the floor of a room in a medical facility where bodies were collected.

Syrian state television quoted a source as saying there was "no truth whatsoever" to the reports.

Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons, and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas, sarin and VX nerve agents.

Assad's officials have said they would never use poison gas - if they had it - against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assad's forces used small amounts of sarin gas in attacks in the past, which Washington called a "red line" that justified international military aid for the rebels.

Assad's government has responded in the past with accusations that it was the rebels that used chemical weapons, which the rebels deny. Western countries say they do not believe the rebels have access to poison gas. Assad's main global ally Moscow says accusations on both sides must be investigated.

Khaled Omar of the opposition Local Council in Ain Tarma said he saw at least 80 bodies at the Hajjah Hospital in Ain Tarma and at a makeshift clinic at Tatbiqiya School in the nearby district of Saqba.

"The attack took place at around 3:00 a.m. (0000 GMT / 8:00 p.m. Tuesday EDT). Most of those killed were in their homes," Omar said.

SURPRISING TIMING

The timing and location of the reported chemical weapons use - just three days after the team of U.N. chemical experts checked in to a Damascus hotel a few km (miles) to the east at the start of their mission - was surprising.

"Logically, it would make little sense for the Syrian government to employ chemical agents at such a time, particularly given the relatively close proximity of the targeted towns (to the U.N. team)," said Charles Lister, analysts at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center.

"Nonetheless, the Ghouta region (where the attacks were reported) is well known for its opposition leanings. Jabhat al-Nusra has had a long-time presence there and the region has borne the brunt of sustained military pressure for months now," he said, referring to a hardline Sunni Islamist rebel group allied to al Qaeda.

"While it is clearly impossible to confirm the chemical weapons claim, it is clear from videos uploaded by reliable accounts that a large number of people have died."

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, said dozens of people were killed, including children, in fierce bombardment. It said Mouadamiya, southwest of the capital, came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict.

The Observatory called on the U.N. experts and international organizations to visit the affected areas to ensure aid could be delivered and to "launch an investigation to determine who was responsible for the bombardment and hold them to account".

headline: Chinese demonstrate for Bo Xilai on the eve of trial
byline: By John Ruwitch
7:26pm EDT

A handful of supporters of ousted Chinese politician Bo Xilai protested outside a courthouse in eastern China on Wednesday on the eve of his trial to denounce what they said was politically motivated persecution.

About 10 people held up signs outside the courthouse in the eastern city of Jinan in Shandong province, where Bo is set to appear in public on Thursday for the first time in 17 months to face charges of bribery, corruption and abuse of power.

The trial of Bo, 64, a charismatic and well-loved leader to some and a power-hungry politician to others, will cap the country's biggest political scandal since the 1976 downfall of the Gang of Four at the end of the Cultural Revolution and could sharpen rifts in a society already divided about his fate.

Although there were only a few protesters at the courthouse, it was a sign that Bo still has a public following and supporters willing to risk being detained by security forces, who routinely lock up those involved in any sort of protest or unrest.

Police tried to move the small crowd of demonstrators away from the street as dozens of journalists camped out in front of the main gate of the courthouse.

The protesters, who came from all over the country, held signs that said: "We're watching the Bo trial to see if it's fair and just."

"When comrade Bo Xilai was put under house arrest, it was a violation of the party charter and when he was handed over to the justice system it was a violation of the constitution," said a protester from Chongqing surnamed Li.

"This trial is illegal. We don't believe in any outcome of this trial."

Bo was the party chief in the sprawling southwestern metropolis of Chongqing at the time of his downfall last year.

There was no immediate sign on Wednesday that a secret session of the trial had started. Sources told Reuters on Tuesday that the charge of abuse of power against Bo relates to his flouting the authority of central leaders in Beijing, an allegation so sensitive that his trial could start one day sooner to hear it in camera.

The public support for Bo, though modest, underscores the difficulty the ruling Communist Party faces in trying to both convince skeptics that Bo's fall was not simply the result of elite infighting, and show the country that Beijing is serious about fighting graft.

Before his dramatic ouster, Bo looked set to join the upper ranks of China's leadership.

After his appointment as party boss of Chongqing in 2007, he had turned the region into a showcase of revolution-inspired Maoist "red" culture, as well as state-led economic growth. Bo's populist ways were welcomed by many of Chongqing's 30 million residents - and others across the country.

But his rise was stopped by a murder scandal involving his wife, Gu Kailai, and his former police chief, Wang Lijun.

Both Gu and Wang have since been jailed over the scandal, which stems from the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in November 2011.

"NOT CORRUPT"

Standing outside the courthouse, a protester from Beijing surnamed Li said: "Bo Xilai is not corrupt, Bo Xilai works for the people and is a good cadre."

"Others have talked about serving the people but they have just left the people hanging out to dry and not done anything practical for the people," Li said. "I hope the Communist Party and (President) Xi Jinping will support justice."

A court spokeswoman in Jinan told Reuters that the trial will not be televised live, although the authorities will provide a press briefing when the court adjourns.

A Hong Kong-based broadcaster, Phoenix Television, reported on Tuesday that the trial will be televised live to reporters in a hotel in Jinan.

The last television coverage of a major trial in China was when state television broadcast excerpts from the trial of the Gang of Four in 1980. Jiang Qing, the wife of Mao Zedong, was removed from the courtroom several times after shouting down judges and insulting witnesses as she stood trial for crimes committed during the Cultural Revolution.

Bo's son, Bo Guagua, has urged the authorities to allow his father to defend himself at his trial. Bo is almost certain to be found guilty, given that China's prosecutors and courts come under Communist Party control and courts have a 98 percent conviction rate.



headline: Japan's nuclear crisis deepens, China expresses 'shock'

6:20pm EDT

Japan's nuclear crisis escalated to its worst level since a massive earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima plant more than two years ago, with the country's nuclear watchdog saying it feared more storage tanks were leaking contaminated water.

The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Wednesday it viewed the situation at Fukushima "seriously" and was ready to help if called upon, while nearby China said it was "shocked" to hear contaminated water was still leaking from the plant, and urged Japan to provide information "in a timely, thorough and accurate way".

effects of the Fukushima nuclear accident," China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement faxed to Reuters in Beijing.

Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga called the situation "deplorable", and the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) said it feared the disaster - the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl a quarter of a century earlier - was "in some respects" beyond the plant operator's ability to cope.

The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co, or Tepco, has been criticized for its failure to prepare for the disaster and has since been accused of covering up the extent of the problems at the plant. After months of denial, Tepco recently admitted the plant was leaking contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean from trenches between the reactor buildings and the shoreline.

It said on Tuesday that contaminated water with dangerously high levels of radiation was leaking from a storage tank - the most serious problem in a series of recent mishaps, including power outages, contaminated workers and other leaks.

The NRA said it was worried about leakage from other similar tanks that were built hastily to store water washed over melted reactors at the station to keep them cool. Water in the latest leak is so contaminated that a person standing close to it for an hour would receive five times the annual recommended limit for nuclear workers.

A spokesman for the NRA said the agency plans to upgrade the severity of the crisis from a Level 1 "anomaly" to a Level 3 "serious incident" on an international scale for radiological releases. An upgrade would be the first time Japan has issued a warning on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) since the three reactor meltdowns at Fukushima in March 2011. Explosions then led to a loss of power and cooling, triggering a maximum INES Level 7 at the plant.

"HAUNTED HOUSE"

NRA Chairman Shunichi Tanaka likened the stricken nuclear plant to a house of horrors at an amusement park. "I don't know if describing it this way is appropriate, but it's like a haunted house and, as I've said, mishaps keep happening one after the other," he told reporters. "We have to look into how we can reduce the risks and how to prevent it from becoming a fatal or serious incident."

He said the NRA would consult with the IAEA about whether it was appropriate to assign a rating to the leakage at the plant.

"Japanese authorities continue to provide the Agency with information on the situation at the plant, and Agency experts are following the issue closely," Gill Tudor, spokesperson at the Vienna-based IAEA, said in an e-mailed statement.

"The IAEA views this matter seriously and remains ready to provide assistance on request."

Each one-step INES increase represents a 10-fold increase in severity, according to a factsheet on the IAEA website. (www.iaea.org/) A Level 3 rating is assigned when there is exposure of more than 10 times the limit for workers, according to the factsheet.

In an emailed comment, Andrew Sherry, director of the Dalton Nuclear Institute at the University of Manchester, said: "Though serious, this leak is a long way from the Level 7 incident we were facing in 2011. The approach taken by Tepco to drain the tank, pump leaked water to temporary storage, and protect the drainage of contaminated water to ground water, is entirely sensible."

"This incident highlights the need for an inspection program for these many hundreds of storage tanks, and the need to consider replacing bolted or sealed storage tanks, which were relatively quick to build, with a more robust welded design."

South Korea's Asiana Airlines Inc said it would cancel charter flights between Seoul and Fukushima city in October due to public concerns over the radioactive water leaks.

The city, around 60 kms (37 miles) from the nuclear facility and with a population of some 284,000, is a popular destination for golfers and tourists visiting nearby local hot springs and lakes.

backed rulers to end a crackdown on deposed President Mohamed Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood.

There may be little they can do to inflict hardship on Cairo by cutting back on aid, because much of their cash goes to civil society groups, not the government, and Saudi Arabia has pledged to plug any shortfall if support is stopped.

But Europe's approach will be closely watched by all sides in Egypt's worst internal strife in its modern history, since the EU has emerged as a key mediator in the conflict.

The bloc's 28 governments are likely to tread carefully, mixing expressions of concern over bloodshed, with limited - if any - changes in the 5 billion euro ($6.7 billion) aid package Europe promised to Egypt last year, diplomats said.

"It is about finding a formula for Europe to help Egypt get from where it is now to where a vast majority of the people say they want to be," EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton told reporters on Tuesday, before the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.

"That's going to be done by a political process and Egypt will need help to get there. And we are ready to help if they so wish," she said.

In July, Ashton became the first foreign official to meet Mursi after he was deposed by the army, taken into detention and placed under investigation on charges including murder.

The EU's subsequent mediation efforts, conducted jointly with the United States, collapsed earlier in August. Several days later, government forces killed hundreds of Mursi's supporters during a crackdown on protest camps.

Ashton has told Egyptian authorities she is willing to go back to mediate. The EU may not have much leverage over the Egyptian military but it can still talk to all sides, while all are suspicious of Washington.

BALANCING POLICY

Underlining unease in the West over how to respond to the crisis in Egypt, the White House said on Tuesday media reports that it had cut off aid to Egypt were inaccurate although the policy was under review.

In recent years, Washington has authorized about $1.3 billion in annual military aid and $250 million in economic assistance for Cairo.

The main dilemma facing the West is how to support democratic transformation in Egypt while ensuring stability in the Arab world's most populous nation.

In Europe, several governments have called for aid cutbacks.

Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans said in a letter to his country's parliament the deaths of about 900 people in Egypt should have "concrete consequences".

"The Netherlands wants the EU to consider cutting aid and conditions for resumption," he said.

Austria's Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger told ORF television aid should be frozen "until democratic conditions are in place again".

But diplomats said some EU governments have questioned the wisdom of cutting support in meetings earlier this week.

The vast majority of funds provided to Egypt by EU institutions are directed to the civil society, while budget support has been stopped in 2012, meaning cutbacks could affect the population more than the government.

Other than aid, foreign ministers will discuss any military support provided by individual European governments to Egypt and, possibly, trade breaks included in a decade-old broad cooperation deal with Cairo. EU trade with Egypt runs at around 2 billion euros a month. ($1 = 0.7448 euros)

backed government, stressing that its bloody crackdown on protesters could influence U.S. aid to Cairo but denying reports that it has suspended the assistance.

The army's clampdown on supporters of deposed Islamist President Mohamed Mursi over the past week, the "suspicious deaths" of 37 prisoners in custody and the detention of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie on Tuesday have worsened relations between Washington and Egypt's new rulers.

President Barack Obama convened a meeting of his national security team on Tuesday to discuss Egypt and the review of American aid to the country. U.S. officials said they do not expect any immediate decision about the aid.

At issue is the future of about $1.23 billion in U.S. military assistance and about $241 million in economic aid to Egypt, a close U.S. ally for three decades until long-time authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak was toppled in 2011 after a popular revolt.

The White House, State Department and Pentagon all disputed a statement by a U.S. senator's office that the U.S. government had decided for now to stop funding to Egypt's military.

But officials made clear that further action, beyond Obama's cancellation of joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercises and a halt to deliveries of four F-16 fighter jets, is not off the table.

Obama and his aides have been trying to navigate a tricky path on Egypt, expressing displeasure with the army's actions while not entirely breaking a relationship crucial to U.S. security interests in the Middle East.

"Our aid and assistance relationship with Egypt is under a review, but it has not been cut off," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. "A decision to cut off aid would be announced, if it were to be announced, after that review has been completed."

Earnest made clear the United States was displeased the detention of Badie.

"This is just the latest in a series of actions the Egyptian government has taken that doesn't reflect their commitment to an inclusive political process, to respect for basic human rights like the right to protest peacefully," Earnest told reporters.

"Continued violations of basic human rights don't make the transfer of that aid more likely," he said.

The United States will judge the Egyptian government by its actions, not its words, Earnest added. "That would include, as a very first preliminary step, beginning to respect the basic human rights of the Egyptian people and to at least signal a transition to an inclusive political process," he said.

THORNY ISSUE

U.S. aid has become a thorny issue for the White House, which has come under pressure from some lawmakers to turn off the aid in response to the bloodshed and detentions of Muslim Brotherhood supporters by Egypt's interim government.

Some in the administration worry that if aid is halted it may be a tough sell to some lawmakers to resume the funding.

As with Obama's balancing act in Syria, where he seeks the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad but has been cautious in backing Syrian rebels in a civil war, the U.S. president's Egypt policy has left many outside analysts unsatisfied.

Elliott Abrams, deputy White House national security adviser under former President George W. Bush, said the United States should have stopped aid to Egypt after Mursi's July 3 ouster.

"This policy has been a disaster because we have seen in the six weeks since the coup that we have managed to alienate every single group in Egypt - the military, the liberals, the Copts," said Abrams, now at the Council on Foreign Relations, referring to Egypt's Coptic Christians.

"It looks as if we are afraid to offend the Egyptian military," Abrams added.

A spokesman for Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs a Senate subcommittee that oversees State Department and foreign operations spending, said on Monday the panel had been told the aid was being halted.

It was not clear what had given rise to the reports of an aid cut off. A spokeswoman for the State Department said it has not yet transferred $585 million in military assistance and is scrutinizing "a tiny bucket" of economic aid to see if it should be curtailed but denied any decision to halt the funds.

Cutting off the aid could be costly for the U.S. government.

One former senior U.S. government official said the United States could face a bill of about $3 billion if it cancels military aid to Egypt since it is one of two countries, along with Israel, able to order equipment before U.S. funds to pay for them have been approved by Congress.

A current U.S. official said some of the costs would flow from penalties for cancelling the contracts as well as the expenses of winding down such programs.

The British government, accused of abusing media freedom, said on Tuesday police were right to detain a journalist's partner if they thought lives might be at risk from data he was carrying from fugitive U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.

Facing legal and diplomatic complaints after police held Guardian writer Glenn Greenwald's Brazilian partner for nine hours on Sunday - and accused by the newspaper of forcing it to trash computers holding copies of Snowden's data - the interior minister said officers were entitled to take security measures.

Home Secretary Theresa May said police held David Miranda at a London airport under anti-terrorism powers, which allow for action to prevent stolen data to aid terrorists. Material from Snowden, published by the Guardian, has revealed extensive U.S. and British surveillance of global communications networks.

"It's absolutely right that if the police believe that somebody is in possession of highly sensitive, stolen information that could help terrorists, that could risk lives, lead to a potential loss of life, the police are able to act - and that's what the law enables them to do," May told the BBC.

She added, however, that an independent reviewer was looking into the police conduct.

As interior minister, May said she was briefed in advance that Miranda might be stopped but added that she did not decide who the police detained. The United States said Britain gave it a "heads up" but it did not ask for Miranda to be questioned.

Snowden, who faces criminal charges in the United States, has been granted a year's asylum by Russia.

A British lawyer who launched an action on Miranda's behalf to question the legal basis of his detention said police seized a laptop computer, a telephone, memory sticks, a computer hard drive and a games console from him. He was released without charge after reaching a time limit on such detentions.

Miranda had been in transit at Heathrow airport, carrying material from Snowden that was being passed from Berlin-based American documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras to Greenwald, an American writer for Britain's Guardian who lives in Rio de Janeiro.

"These items contain sensitive, confidential journalistic material and should not have been seized," Miranda's London lawyers wrote in a letter to May and the police.

In an interview with CNN along with Greenwald, Miranda said the officers who questioned him told him he could be jailed if he did not answer everything they asked. Even though he was detained under an anti-terrorism law, he said: "No, they didn't ask me anything about terrorism - not one question about it."

Brazil's government has complained to Britain. The action against Miranda also was denounced by British opposition politicians, human rights lawyers and press freedom groups.

The leaks by Snowden, a former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, disclosed details of NSA and British surveillance of public telephone and internet traffic. The United States and Britain say their agencies acted within their laws and the leaks threatened their national security.

'YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN'

On Tuesday, Guardian editors revealed how and why the newspaper destroyed computer hard drives containing copies of some of the secret files leaked by Snowden.

A timeline of events provided by the Guardian said initial British attempts to stop reporting on the files came two weeks after the newspaper published its first three stories based on Snowden's leaks.

These stories were about a secret U.S. court order obliging communications company Verizon to hand over data on customers' phone usage, Britain's secretive Government Communications Headquarters' (GCHQ) use of data from an NSA internet monitoring program, and British intelligence spying on allies in London.

Shortly afterward, two senior British officials arrived to see editor Alan Rusbridger to demand the newspaper hand over all its Snowden files, arguing the material was stolen, according to the Guardian's timeline. He refused.

Three weeks later, in July, after the publication of more articles, officials got back in touch with Rusbridger and told him, according to the newspaper: "You've had your fun. Now we want the stuff back."

The officials expressed fears that foreign governments, particularly Russia or China, could hack into the newspaper's IT network although the journalists stressed the documents were not stored on any Guardian system but held in isolation, according to the newspaper.

Between July 16 and 19, the Guardian said government pressure intensified and there was an explicit threat of legal action if the newspaper did not comply.

Rusbridger said he decided if the government was determined to stop Britain-based reporting on the Snowden files, the best option was to destroy the London copy and to edit and report from the same material held in the United States and Brazil.

On July 20, two "security experts" from GCHQ visited the paper's London head office and watched as deputy editor Paul Johnson, executive director Sheila Fitzsimons and a newspaper computer expert used angle grinders and other tools to pulverize hard drives and memory chips storing encrypted files, according to the newspaper. Both sides knew other copies existed outside the Britain.

"I hope what (the Miranda detention controversy) will do is to send people back to read the stories that so upset the British state because there has been a lot of reporting about what GCHQ and the NSA are up to," Rusbridger said.

In Washington, White House spokesman John Earnest said he could not comment on the destruction of some of the Guardian's Snowden material. But he said he could not see U.S. authorities destroying an American media company's hard drives to protect national security.

"That's very difficult to imagine a scenario in which that would be appropriate," Earnest told reporters.

Greenwald told CNN he felt emboldened by Britain's actions.

"It's not going to stop our reporting. It doesn't do them any good. All it did ... is give them a huge black eye in the world, make them look thuggish and authoritarian, interfering in the journalism process" while creating an international incident with the government of Brazil, Greenwald added.

"Journalism is not a crime and it is not terrorism," he said. He also criticized the United States for having received a "heads up" about Miranda being questioned but doing nothing to discourage it or protect the rights of a free press.

byline: By Gernot Heller
7:26pm EDT

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Tuesday for the first time that Greece will need another bailout, triggering a storm of protest from opposition parties five weeks before an election in Europe's biggest economy.

While analysts have long predicted Greece will require more aid, albeit on a smaller scale than previous bailouts totaling about 240 billion euros ($320 billion), Chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to keep Greece out of her campaign for re-election to avoid angering German voters who fear they will foot the bill.

Just hours before Schaeuble spoke, Merkel was quoted in a regional newspaper as saying there was no point in discussing additional aid to Greece before the end of next year, when its second rescue package will expire.

But at a campaign event in northern Germany, her outspoken minister departed from that line, breaking what had been seen as an election campaign taboo.

"There will have to be another program in Greece," Schaeuble said.

2016.

"Greece and its lenders are examining several ways to plug any funding gap that Greece will face over the next few years," the official said on condition of anonymity.

The aid program announced by Schaeuble will be at least partly financed via the EU budget, German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung cited unnamed sources as saying in an advance extract of an article due to be published on Wednesday.

The newspaper said discussions were underway about making extra money from the EU's structural funds available to Athens, which could use it to boost the economy and free up national budgetary resources to pay off debt.

The newspaper cited government sources in Berlin as saying that the third aid program would be much smaller than the first two and the conditions would also be less strict as Greece has already set a lot of the necessary changes in motion.

The International Monetary Fund last month estimated Greece's funding gap for 2014-2015 at 10.9 billion euros.

size" bond issue, finance minister Yannis Stournaras told Reuters last month. But market observers increasingly doubt the situation has improved enough to allow a bond market return next year.

Schaeuble has said in the past that international lenders may have to consider a new aid program for Greece after the existing one runs out at the end of 2014.

But he has never described this as inevitable, as he appeared to do on Tuesday.

His comments came shortly after the European Central Bank said Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen, a German who used to work for Schaeuble, would be heading to Athens on Wednesday to discuss progress on reforms needed to ensure the country receives more bailout money.

Greece received an aid tranche of 5.8 billion euros from its international lenders in July. It stands to receive another 1 billion euros in October, subject to implementation of further reforms.

Inspectors from the "troika" - the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF - will return to Athens in the autumn to find out whether the government needs to find further savings to meet its 2015-2016 budget targets.

As a prelude, Asmussen will meet Central Bank Governor George Provopoulos, Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras and George Zanias, chairman of Greece's biggest lender, National Bank, on his trip this week, Greek sources told Reuters.

"TELL THE TRUTH"

Schaeuble's comments played into the hands of the opposition, who throughout the election campaign have accused Merkel of failing to tell voters the truth about Greece.

"I have made clear that saving Europe and keeping the continent together comes at a cost, also for us Germans," Merkel's Social Democrat (SPD) challenger Peer Steinbrueck said after Schaeuble spoke. "Now it's time that Frau Merkel tells people the truth."

Greens leader Juergen Trittin said Schaeuble had exposed Merkel's "deceit" and criticized the chancellor for advocating austerity policies in Greece that had failed to reduce its debt load.

Progress on reform in recession-stricken Greece has been patchy and there have been several reports that it may need another aid package or more debt relief.

As Europe's biggest economy, Germany takes the biggest share of the bailouts, which are unpopular with taxpayers.

Merkel looks on track to win a third term next month, in part because voters applaud the hard line she has taken with bailed-out countries like Greece.

But any indication she is covering up the risks of another rescue could hurt her at a time when she is battling to win the votes needed to keep her center-right coalition together.

"Greece is a dangerous subject. It is not clever to bring it up again just as there was a general feeling of calm," said Emnid pollster Klaus-Peter Schoeppner.

In the interview with the Ruhr Nachrichten newspaper, Merkel was asked about additional aid for Athens and responded: "In the euro zone, we always said that we would evaluate the Greek situation again at the end of 2014 or in early 2015. It makes sense to stick to this timeline." ($1 = 0.7490 euros)

backed government in protest at its bloody crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood.

The case points to the prospect of a new wave of politically driven lawsuits being brought to court following the downfall of President Mohamed Mursi, whose supporters brought a raft of cases against opposition figures during his year in power.

Anti-government activists had called those suits, many of them accusing people of "insulting the president", a form of political intimidation.

ElBaradei's case, brought by an Egyptian law professor, will be heard in a Cairo court on September 19, judicial sources said on Tuesday.

ElBaradei, the former head of the U.N. nuclear agency and co-leader of the secular National Salvation Front (NSF) grouping, was the most prominent liberal to endorse the military's overthrow of Mursi on July 3 following mass protests.

But he resigned on August 14 after security forces attacked the protest camps set up by Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Cairo, killing hundreds of people.

The military's intervention against Mursi has polarized public opinion in Egypt. Around 900 people have died in violence across the country over the past week.

Sayyed Ateeq, a law professor at Helwan University, filed the suit against ElBaradei.

Mursi protests.

"Doctor ElBaradei was entrusted with this position and he had a duty to go back to those who entrusted him and ask to resign" instead of stepping down on his own, he said.

Ateeq said that, if found guilty, ElBaradei could face a three-year prison sentence. But a judicial source said the maximum sentence in a case of this kind was a fine and a suspended jail term.

ElBaradei left Egypt this week for Europe and is unlikely to attend any hearing in the case.

Khaled Dawoud, an aide to ElBaradei who quit as NSF spokesman following the crackdown, said Ateeq "set a precedent that harms Egypt's reputation abroad, when a politician is prosecuted just for resigning from his post, something that has never happened before in any country in the world".

The lawsuit follows a wave of arrests of Muslim Brotherhood leaders in recent days and a decision by the public prosecutor to charge Mursi, who is being detained in an undisclosed location, with inciting violence.

"If this case against ElBaradei is true then it is a major escalation showing that things are getting very polarized. You're either on this side or on that side," Dawoud told Reuters.



headline: Erdogan angers U.S., Israel, Egypt with Mursi defense

7:26pm EDT

Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan angered Ankara's U.S. ally, as well as regional leaders in Egypt and Israel, by accusing Israel on Tuesday of helping overthrow Cairo's Islamist president.

The White House called the remarks "offensive".

Erdogan, who has become one of the fiercest critics of the Egyptian army's removal of Mohamed Mursi, told members of his Islamist-rooted AK Party that he had proof that Israel was involved in last month's ouster, which has been followed by a bloody crackdown on the elected president's Muslim Brotherhood.

"What do they say in Egypt? Democracy is not the ballot box. What is behind it? Israel. We have in our hands documentation," Erdogan said in comments broadcast by TRT state television.

An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called that "nonsense". Egypt's new, military-installed government said no one "sane or fair" could accept Erdogan's allegation.

In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said: "We strongly condemn the statements that were made by Prime Minister Erdogan today. Suggesting that Israel is somehow responsible for recent events in Egypt is offensive, unsubstantiated and wrong."

Erdogan's AK party traces its roots to an Islamist movement banned at a time when Turkey's military held great influence and has positioned itself as a model for conservative, democratic politicians in the Middle East moving away from dictatorship.

Erdogan's support for the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt, and a souring of once warm Turkish ties with Israel, had seemed to give Ankara a growing regional influence. The change of rule in Egypt may hinder that, while outspoken defense of Egypt's Islamists could affect Turkey's relations with the West.

Turkey, which has a secular constitution, has the second-biggest armed forces in NATO and is a long-standing candidate for European Union membership.

EGYPTIAN DENIAL

Erdogan's comments aimed to divide Egyptians, the state news agency MENA quoted ministers as saying: "The cabinet stresses that Egypt's patience is wearing thin," it said. "Egypt does not share others' enmities, and is not about to go in search of a new identity. Its Arab and Islamic nature is obvious."

Erdogan did not say what documentation he had, but referred to comments he said an Israeli cabinet minister had made before Egyptian parliamentary elections that were held after a popular uprising pushed President Hosni Mubarak from power.

"Before the 2011 elections, during a session in France, the justice minister and an intellectual from France - he's Jewish too - they used exactly this comment: 'Even if the Muslim Brotherhood wins the election, they will not win because democracy is not the ballot box'," Erdogan said.

"That is exactly what happened," he said, without naming either the minister nor the French intellectual.

He appeared to refer to comments available in an online video from a seminar in mid-2011 involving French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy and Tzipi Livni, then the leader of Israel's opposition and now justice minister. Livni has questioned the Brotherhood's willingness to respect democratic opposition.

A spokeswoman for Livni said of Erdogan's remarks: "Any attempt to try and tie Israel and Minister Livni to Egypt's internal affairs is unfounded."

Turkey's relations with Israel have soured in recent years and hit a low in May 2010 when Israeli commandos killed nine Turkish activists while storming the Mavi Marmara, a ship in a convoy seeking to break an Israeli naval blockade of Gaza.

Earlier this year, Erdogan called Zionism "a crime against humanity", prompting objections from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. President Barack Obama subsequently orchestrated an Israeli apology for the Mavi Marmara raid.

At least two senior AK Party officials have suggested there was Jewish involvement in anti-government protests that rocked Turkey in late May and June.

Erdogan repeatedly blamed unnamed foreign interests and an "interest-rate lobby" for those protests, in what he deemed an anti-democratic effort to undo Turkey's last three elections, in which the AK Party increased its share of the vote each time.

"The West needs to learn the definition of democracy, Erdogan said. "If it cannot ... these clashes will carry the world towards a different place. What is that? It will take it towards autocratic regimes. That is our concern."



headline: Czech Communists may get share of power after snap election

7:26pm EDT

The Czech parliament voted on Tuesday to dissolve itself, triggering an early election that could hand the Communist Party a share in power for the first time since a bloodless revolution ended the party's totalitarian rule two decades ago.

Opinion polls show that the center-left Social Democrats will be the biggest party, but they will need support from other groups to govern and the leader of the party said he would talk to the Communists about forming a partnership.

In the eyes of many people in the country of 10 million people, the Communists are linked to 41 years of repression. But by being out of power for so long, the party has escaped the taint of sleaze that has tarnished the governments that took over from it.

Tuesday's vote to dissolve parliament came about after the previous government folded under charges from prosecutors that an aide to the prime minister, who was also his lover, had his wife put under surveillance.

The dissolution was supported by 140 members of the 200-seat lower house of parliament. The president, Milos Zeman, must now schedule an election, likely to be at the end of October.

Zeman's chief of staff Vratislav Mynar said late on Tuesday the president would meet party leaders on Friday to discuss the date of the election.

In an interview with Reuters before the dissolution vote, Social Democrat leader Bohuslav Sobotka said he hoped his party would form a minority government backed by other groups.

"It is definitely possible to expect negotiations with KSCM (the Communist Party,)" Sobotka said. "The Communists are in a number of town halls and in regional leaderships, and I do not see it causing problems."

But he said his party would not accommodate the Communists' program or bring them into a governing coalition.

That was a nod to the toxic reputation the Communists still have for many Czechs, and to worries about back-tracking on market reforms in the Czech Republic, one of the more stable emerging markets that has attracted heavy foreign investment.

ECONOMIC POLICY

Sobotka signaled though that if his party forms a government, its economic policy would be more leftist than the previous center-right coalition government, with plans to raise taxes for the biggest corporations and for high earners.

Before Vaclav Havel, who was nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize, led the 1989 Velvet Revolution to force it out, the Communist party held on to power through its feared secret police and with backing from Red Army tanks which put down the 1968 Prague Spring uprising.

Jiri Stransky, a dissident writer imprisoned under Communist rule and a friend of the late Havel's, said he believed today's Communists were dangerous populists.

"I am saddened that after nearly 24 years the country has ended this way, when we started out so amazingly," he said.

An opinion poll conducted this month by Czech pollster SANEP gave Sobotka's Social Democrats a 27.0 percent share of the vote, followed by the Communists on 16.7 percent, and the conservative TOP09 party with 13.1 percent.

Sobotka could try to win support for a government from other leftist parties, but they are likely to be so small that it will be tough to establish stable rule. That makes a partnership with the Communists the more likely scenario.

The party has apologized for Communist-era repression, and its domestic policies are not very far from those of the Social Democrats. They both want corporations to pay more tax, and to ramp up government investment.

But Communist lawmakers still call one another "comrade" and the party's deputy chairman has a portrait of Karl Marx in his office. In foreign policy, the Communists are more hardline. They want to withdraw from the NATO military alliance.

The Czech Republic has been in a state of political turmoil since June 13 when police, some wearing balaclavas, raided government offices.

Prime Minister Petr Necas resigned after prosecutors charged the head of his office, Jana Nagyova, with ordering intelligence agents to put Necas's wife under surveillance. Necas, who is divorcing his wife, later said Nagyova was his lover.

A caretaker government that took over from Necas failed to win parliament's support, leading to Tuesday's vote on dissolving parliament - the only way to break the stalemate.

Markets have been largely unfazed by the political turmoil because fiscal rigor under previous governments has given Prague the lowest borrowing costs among central European peers and a debt load which is half the European Union average.

But the gridlock has delayed the drafting of the 2014 budget and caused anxiety that, without firm political leadership, the economy will stumble just as it is starting to emerge from nearly two years of recession.

headline: Egyptian court could free Mubarak as crisis deepens

backed authorities are hunting down his Muslim Brotherhood foes.

The court will convene at the Cairo prison where Mubarak is being held, judicial sources said, and review a petition from his lawyer demanding the leader overthrown in a 2011 revolt be freed.

If the court upholds the petition, there would remain no legal grounds for Mubarak's detention, though he is being retried on charges of complicity in the killing of protesters in 2011.

At 85, Mubarak may have no political future, but his release could stir emotions and raise new questions on whether the popular uprising that ended his 30-year rule is leading back to a new form of military government. His ouster was part of the Arab Spring uprisings that swept through the Arab world in 2011.

If Mubarak is freed this week, as his lawyer predicts, it would come only six weeks after the armed forces that he once commanded deposed his freely elected successor, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi.

Egypt is enduring the bloodiest internal conflict in its modern history, with about 900 people, including 100 police and soldiers, killed after security forces broke up pro-Mursi protest camps in the capital on August 14. A spokesman for a pro-Brotherhood alliance put the death toll among its followers at about 1,400.

Signaling their determination to crush the group and silence protests against the ousting of Mursi, Egypt's army-backed authorities on Tuesday arrested Mohamed Badie, the Brotherhood's leader.

His arrest followed a wave of detentions among the upper echelons of the organization. A Muslim Brotherhood statement condemned the arrest of Badie, 70.

"The putschists think that arresting the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood and marring their image in the media will make Egyptians bow and give in to the coup," it said.

"The issue has become one of the Egyptian people and they will not bow. ... They have killed thousands, wounded thousands, arrested thousands but the (people) are continuing in their peaceful revolution and rejecting the coup and military rule."

DIPLOMATIC CONCERNS

The turmoil has alarmed the United States and the European Union, but Israel and some Gulf Arab states led by Saudi Arabia have pressed the West not to punish Cairo's new rulers.

Badie was charged in July with incitement to murder in connection with protests before Mursi's ouster and is due to stand trial on August 25 along with his two deputies. On Tuesday, the public prosecutor ordered his detention for 30 days on the charges of incitement to killing during anti-Mursi protests in November and demonstrations in Cairo last month.

Footage shown on local media showed the bearded leader sitting grim-faced in a grey robe near a man with a rifle following his detention in Cairo in the early hours.

The release of the images seemed designed to humiliate the Brotherhood chief, whose arrest means the group's top echelon is now behind bars, with other leaders dropping out of sight.

After decades as an outlawed movement, the Brotherhood emerged as the best-organized political force after Mubarak's fall. Now the state accuses it of al Qaeda-style militancy and subversion, charges it vehemently denies.

The Islamist group, founded in 1928, used its organizational muscle to secure victory for Mursi in last year's presidential election. It says it has about a million members among Egypt's 85 million people, as well as offshoots across the Arab world.

The whereabouts of many other senior Brotherhood politicians are unknown. Those who had been posting frequently on social media have stopped in the past two days. Arrests have extended beyond Cairo, netting provincial leaders of the movement.

The state news agency said Badie was now in Cairo's Tora prison, where other Brotherhood leaders are held.

Jeffrey Feltman, U.N. under-secretary for political affairs, arrived in Egypt on Tuesday for talks that U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban has said would focus on initiatives to restore peace and forge reconciliation.

The United States, a close ally of Egypt since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, said on Monday it was still reviewing whether to freeze any of its $1.55 billion annual aid package to Egypt, which mostly funds U.S. weapons supplies.

Foreign ministers of the European Union, another donor to Egypt, meet in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss how it might apply its influence for a peaceful compromise.

A British source with knowledge of the security services said GCHQ had no powers to seize material from the Guardian, but could have accused the newspaper of possessing stolen materials and demanded they be destroyed.

Taking a pause in her campaign for a third term in office, the chancellor met survivors, including Abba Naor, an 85-year-old Jew whose mother and 5-year-old brother were murdered in concentration camps along with dozens more relatives.

"Merkel is coming here to say we will never forget what happened here," the Lithuanian-born former inmate said.

The Nazis set up Dachau, near Munich, in 1933, weeks after Adolf Hitler took power, to detain political rivals. It became the prototype for a network of camps where 6 million Jews were murdered, as well as Roma, Russians, Poles and homosexuals.

More than 200,000 people had been detained in the camp by the time U.S. troops liberated it in 1945. Television footage showing piles of bodies and starved inmates in the camp was among the first images the world saw of the Holocaust crimes.

The chilling motto "Arbeit macht frei" (Work makes you free) on the main gate to Dachau still greets the 800,000 annual visitors to the camp, where Merkel spoke to a small group survivors in the camp's parade ground, surrounded by drab grey barracks and watchtowers.

"The name Dachau is tragically famous as it serves as a model for the concentration camps," the chancellor said. "The memory of that fate fills me with deep sadness and shame."

She said she was concerned about ongoing right-wing extremism in Germany, where a small neo-Nazi cell, the National Socialist Underground, is on trial for murdering nine immigrants and a policewoman between 2000 and 2007.

CAMPAIGN CONTINUES

About 15 minutes after the visit to Dachau, Merkel shifted gear and gave a political speech at a campaign event with Bavarian conservatives in a beer tent in the nearby town of the same name, Dachau. She appeared on stage with a brass band whose members were wearing traditional lederhosen and dirndl.

The Bavarian conservatives are key allies in her campaign for re-election in a federal election on September 22, which opinion polls suggest she is likely to win.

From the political opposition, Renate Kuenast of the Greens said it was in "bad taste" for the chancellor to squeeze in a visit to Dachau between her campaign stops in Bavaria.

"Anyone who was serious about commemorating such a place of horror wouldn't pay such a visit during the election campaign," the Greens' parliamentary leader told a Leipzig newspaper.

But leaders of the German Jewish community appeared to disagree with Kuenast. Charlotte Knobloch, a vice-president of the World Jewish Congress who lives in Munich, said Merkel's visit to Dachau showed her historical awareness and sense of responsibility.

"It's remarkable that the chancellor changed her plans at the last minute during the hot phase of the election campaign," said Knobloch, who was born in Munich in 1932 and was saved from the camps by Catholic farmers.

Survivor Naor said the German population would decide whether Merkel was right to make the visit during the campaign.

"Merkel is smart enough to understand and say the right thing at the right time. I heard Merkel say in the Knesset that an attack on Israel is an attack on Germany and I thought she is my chancellor," he said.

Although Merkel, who visited Dachau as a minister in 1992, is the first federal chancellor to visit Dachau, a German head of state - then president Horst Koehler - attended the 65th anniversary of its liberation three years ago.

Merkel also visited the Buchenwald camp with U.S. President Barack Obama in 2009.

making material from Quetta, one of Pakistan's most violent cities, on Tuesday night, a security official said.

The material was the same type used in two bombings of a predominantly Shi'ite Muslim part of Quetta this year that killed around 200 people, Col. Maqbool Shah of the Frontier Corps told Reuters.

The raid came a day after two men were arrested driving a truck in the city with 15 tons of potassium chlorate, a chemical used in bomb-making, hidden under boxes of potato chips, Shah said.

Information from the two men led officers to a warehouse stocked with potassium chlorate, circuit wire, sulphur, aluminum powder, acid, detonating equipment, guns and ammunition. There were also machines to mix the materials together, he said.

Eighty drums of material had been prepared and were ready to explode if a detonator was attached, and ten people were arrested, he added.

"I'm very thankful to God that today we saved Quetta especially and Baluchistan generally from a big accident," he told Reuters.

Quetta is the provincial capital of Baluchistan, an arid, sparsely populated and mineral-rich region in the west of the country that makes up nearly half of Pakistan's land mass.

Various militants are active in the city, including the Pakistani Taliban, sectarian groups and separatist nationalist insurgents. Paramilitary government forces have also been accused of abducting and killing civilians, charges they deny.

It was unclear which group owned the cache of bomb-making equipment. But Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a banned Sunni militant group, claimed the two bombings in Quetta earlier this year.

In one of the blasts, around a ton of explosives was hidden in a water tanker. In the other, militants packed an ambulance with explosives.

Both bombings targeted the Hazara Shi'ite community, an ethnically distinct religious minority.

After both attacks, the relatives of the dead had to sit in the street with the bodies of their loved ones for several days before Pakistani government officials promised to take action.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, whose government swept to power in May elections, has said he is committed to peace.

He has not clarified whether he will focus on seeking talks with militants or stepping up security operations against them.

Experts say whatever his decision, he will need the approval of Pakistan's powerful army.



headline: Colombian rebels say they share blame for decades of bloodshed
byline: By Nelson Acosta
7:26pm EDT

Colombia's largest rebel organization for the first time on Tuesday accepted partial responsibility for decades of bloodshed and called for a commission to investigate the causes of the armed conflict that has killed more than 200,000.

The admission from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) came after a similar one by the Colombian government and appeared to mark some progress in peace negotiations that have dragged on for nine months in Havana while fighting continues in Colombia.

"The FARC are aware that up to now there have not been victors nor vanquished and the struggle continues," said a statement, read by rebel negotiator Pablo Catatumbo on the sidelines of the talks.

"Without a doubt there has also been cruelty and pain provoked by our forces."

The Colombian government and other sectors of society have accused the FARC, which has an estimated 8,000 members, of evading its responsibility for the bloodshed and displacement of millions of people over the years.

Last month a government commission blamed the government, rebels and right-wing paramilitary forces for the carnage and suffering the conflict has caused.

President Juan Manuel Santos acknowledged at the time that the Colombian state was responsible for serious violations of human rights during the conflict.

Discussions to end the longest and last remaining armed conflict in Latin America began last November.

The two sides, which are working through a five-point agenda, have only reached partial agreement on agrarian reform.

Negotiators now are discussing the FARC's inclusion into the political system and then will move on to reparations to war victims, the drug trade and an end to the conflict.

The FARC statement said that it was proposing in the talks that a commission of Colombian and foreign experts be created to investigate the causes of the conflict with an eye toward war reparations.

"We must all recognize the need to approach the issue of victims, their identity and reparation with complete fidelity to the cause of peace and reconciliation," it said.

headline: Nigeria navy parades four from rare pirate capture
byline: By Tim Cocks
7:26pm EDT

The Nigerian sailors had started marching four captured pirates onto a boat when an officer shouted "hold on" to give the cameras a chance to get into position.

With a semi-circle of local reporters in dark orange life jackets snapping photos and rolling film, the men started moving again at Lagos naval command, chains clanking around their ankles.

The four were arrested during one of only two successful operations against a sharp rise in pirate attacks this year - and Nigerian authorities were determined to squeeze the maximum publicity out of their coup.

Pirate raids off West Africa's coastline have jeopardized shipping of commodities from the region, while insurance costs are soaring.

Commodore Chris Ezekobe, naval commander at the NNS Beecroft, a Lagos naval base, said the four had hijacked the barge and its crew on August 14 on the eastern edge of the Nigerian coast, near the port city of Calabar.

The navy intercepted the vessel, which had the pirates' speedboat in tow behind it. No one came out, nor did they respond to a radio call, Ezekobe said.

After the navy fired shots across their bow, they dropped their weapons into the water, he said, with the four bedraggled and skinny men in shorts and T-shirts standing behind him as he spoke.

Last week, the navy said it killed 12 pirates in a gun battle as they tried to flee a fuel tanker, and captured the four remaining survivors.

"These guys and the guys on the other boat, that's it," he said, when asked how many pirates had been arrested this year.

Police operations faced significant challenges in the oil-producing Niger Delta's labyrinthine creeks and swamps, he added.

"It's easy to make a sneak attack and head back into the creeks," he told reporters.

The crew of nine who had been taken hostage were also on the freed vessel during his statement. None spoke to the press.

It is very rare for the navy to catch pirates. Vessels are usually quickly robbed of cargo and valuables then released, while the pirates make their escape.

Crews are usually abducted alongside the boat, sometimes for ransom, which makes it dangerous to fire on the pirates to stop them, Lagos Navy spokesman Jerry Omodara said.

backed government in protest at its bloody crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood.

The case, brought by an Egyptian law professor, will be heard in a Cairo court on September 19, judicial sources said on Tuesday.

It points to the prospect of a new wave of politically driven lawsuits being brought to court following the downfall of President Mohamed Mursi, whose supporters brought a raft of cases against opposition figures during his year in power.

The cases, many of them for "insulting the president", have been criticized by anti-government activists as a form of political intimidation.

ElBaradei, former head of the U.N. nuclear agency and co-leader of the secular National Salvation Front, was the most prominent liberal to endorse the military's overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi on August 3 following mass protests.

But he made new enemies on August 14 by resigning after security forces used force to crush the protest camps set up by Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Cairo, killing hundreds of people.

The military's intervention against Mursi has polarized public opinion in Egypt and around 900 people have died in violence across the country over the past week.

The case was filed by Sayyed Ateeq, a law professor at Helwan University.

Mursi protests.

"Dr. ElBaradei was entrusted with this position and he had a duty to go back to those who entrusted him and ask to resign."

Ateeq said that, if found guilty, ElBaradei could face a three year jail sentence. But a judicial source said the maximum sentence that could be imposed in a case of this kind was a fine and a suspended jail term.

ElBaradei left Egypt earlier this week for Europe and is unlikely to attend any hearing in this case.

The lawsuit follows a wave of arrests of Muslim Brotherhood leaders in recent days and a decision by the public prosecutor to charge Mursi, who is being detained in an undisclosed location, with inciting violence.

Khaled Dawoud, a former aide to ElBaradei who joined him in quitting the National Salvation Front following the crackdown, said any decision to try the Nobel peace prize winner would be a political escalation against critics of the military crackdown.

"If this case against ElBaradei is true then it is a major escalation showing that things are getting very polarized. You're either on this side or on that side," he told Reuters.

"Things took a very different turn from what someone like myself expected when I took part in the June 30 demonstrations against Mursi."



headline: Syrian Kurds' flight drags Iraq deeper into neighbor's war
byline: By Murad Talaat
6:20pm EDT

year conflict could only get worse.

About 35,000 Syrian refugees have poured into neighboring Iraqi Kurdistan over a new border crossing since Thursday, fleeing a surge in attacks by al Qaeda-linked Sunni Arab rebel group al-Nusra Front on Kurdish villages near the border.

"There is no peaceful solution in Syria. The regime is bombing us and al-Nusra Front members are blowing themselves up all over the place," Qarou said in front of rows of United Nations aid tents.

The sudden massive exodus has raised the prospect of Iraq being dragged deeper into Syria's war. The leader of Iraq's Kurdish region, with thousands of troops under arms, has pledged to protect his kinsmen in Syria from attacks by al Qaeda-linked fighters who hold territory on both sides of the frontier.

Men, women and children crossed a temporary metal pontoon bridge over the Tigris River, carrying small knapsacks or rolled up carpets stuffed with their possessions.

Outside dusty aid tents, some families had arranged their sandals and shoes in neat rows. Children played among crates of U.N. supplies and aid workers handed out bread.

"The border had to be opened because of the increased violence between al-Nusra Front and Kurds," a senior Kurdish official said. "There was a backlog of people wanting to cross which is why the numbers are so large."

Aid agencies said on Thursday that Iraq's Kurdish region had capped the number of refugees allowed in to 3,000 a day to cope with the sudden influx, one of the biggest cross-border migrations of a war that has killed more than 100,000 people.

The Kurdish regional government shut the frontier months ago, but opened it last Thursday, triggering the mass influx.

Mustapha Sheikh Hassan said his family had fled from town to town in Syria before deciding to come to Iraq.

Hassan's family first escaped Damascus and headed to his hometown in Syria's Kurdish-populated northeast, only to find it under siege by al-Nusra Front fighters. They then traveled to another town which was hardly better.

"There was no water, no electricity and no life, so I left," he said.

REBELS CLASH WITH KURDISH FIGHTERS

Kurds have become one of the warring parties in Syria since the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad splintered on sectarian and ethnic lines, with rival rebel groups turning on each other as they try to grab control of territory.

In the northeast, Kurds have flown their own flag over towns and villages, suggesting an aim to create an autonomous region like the one that has maintained self rule next door in northern Iraq since 1991.

A month ago, Syrian Kurdish forces won control of the town of Ras al-Ain on the Turkish border in battle with al Qaeda-linked fighters.

In response to the Kurdish gains, Sunni Islamist rebels have stepped up their attacks in northern Syria in the last 10 days, said Rami Abdelrahman from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group.

The Sunni Islamist rebels have been fighting against Kurds across a swathe of northern Syria where Kurds are concentrated, including around Aleppo and near Turkish border crossings.

Syria's civil war is now deeply connected to the worsening violence across the frontier in Iraq, with Sunni Islamist militants on the Syrian side joining forces this year with Iraq's own resurgent branch of al Qaeda. In Iraq, al Qaeda attacks on civilians and the security forces have brought violence to levels unseen for at least five years.

Earlier this month Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani said his regional government would "make use of all of its capabilities to defend women and children and innocent civilians" on the Syrian side of the border.

He has sent envoys to Syria to report on the plight of Kurds ahead of a regional conference on September 15-17 in Arbil involving Kurdish groups from Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran.

Barzani controls thousands of highly-trained and capable troops in his regional security forces known as Peshmerga, which could have a major impact if they joined the war in Syria. Kurdish officials have played down the idea of direct military action, insisting that Barzani is offering only humanitarian aid, political pressure, diplomatic support and coordination.

"All that Barzani will do is host the refugees, regardless their numbers, in a way that does not negatively impact his local and international agreements," a senior Kurdish official in the central government in Baghdad said.

"Now that the war in Syria turns into a war between al-Qaeda and the Syrian regime, Kurds are paying the cost. It was necessary to find all the means to shelter these refugees because they are Kurds."

7:26pm EDT

The Czech Republic's next government could be dependent on the support of the Communist party for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the likely next prime minister said on Tuesday.

The central European country has been mired in a political stalemate since its center-right cabinet collapsed in June in a graft scandal. Parliament is to vote on Tuesday on dissolving itself, which would trigger an early election.

party government most likely supported by the Communist Party (KSCM).

"It is definitely possible to expect negotiations with KSCM. It can be only KSCM or it can be more parties (that will support a minority government)," Sobotka said.

Opinion polls show his party will have the biggest share of the vote in the election.

The Social Democrats would not invite the Communists, who oppose NATO membership, to enter a coalition government with them, Sobotka said.

"We are proponents of European integration and we are proponents of our membership in the NATO. The Social Democrats do not intend to accommodate the program of the Communist party in any way."

ECONOMY

The Czech Republic has emerged from a seven-quarter long recession in the April-June period, the longest since records started in 1996.

Sobotka signaled his party would ease the austerity measures imposed by previous governments.

"The government will not scare people with across-the-board cuts," Sobotka said.

If in power, the Social Democrats would help kick-start the economy by boosting spending on infrastructure and housing with the help of EU development funds.

Sobotka said the party would aim to introduce a second corporate income tax rate at 25 percent or 30 percent to be levied on companies with a dominant or monopoly position on the market, in particular in the telecoms and power utilities sectors.

He said a Social Democrat government would seek to keep the public sector deficit below the EU-prescribed threshold of 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and make sure the country meets all the criteria to adopt the single currency.

Czechs can meet the fiscal criteria for euro adoption, Sobotka said, but he expressed concern with the rising debt level.

"I see a risk in the overall public debt because the next government will take over when the public debt will be around 48 percent of GDP, only 12 percentage points short of the maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty."

"The Czech Republic will have to be very cautious not to complicate its euro adoption in the mid term."

He said the next government would prepare Czechs for euro adoption, and that accession to the single currency could, if conditions were right, take place at some point after 2017.



headline: Assad's forces counter rebel gains in Syria's Deir al-Zor
byline: By Khaled Yacoub Oweis
6:20pm EDT

Assad forces, opposition activists said.

The provincial capital on the banks of the Euphrates, 430 km (270 miles) northeast of Damascus, anchors a vast, arid oil-producing region bordering Iraq. Half of it fell to rebels a year ago but Assad's forces have held out in several districts in the west of the Sunni Muslim city and in the airport to the east.

A rebel coalition led by a Qatari-backed force and the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front captured the western al-Hawiqa district last week, seizing army and security compounds as well as Assad's ruling Baath Party headquarters, the activists said.

Assad is battling a two-year-old uprising which has descended into a devastating civil war. Rebels control most of the Euphrates valley, from the Turkish border in the north to the frontier with Iraq in the southeast, as well as the rural north around Aleppo.

The northeastern Kurdish corner of Syria is also largely outside Assad's control, leaving his power concentrated around the south, center and Mediterranean coast - areas where his forces have consolidated control in recent months.

The army hit rebel forces in Hawiqa district on Tuesday with tanks and multiple rocket launchers, and also battled them in territory separating Hawiqa from the district of Joura, opposition sources in the city said.

"The regime is trying to regain Hawiqa because it cannot afford the rebels to be so close to its most important stronghold of Joura and the army camp there," said Abu al-Tayyeb al-Deiri of the opposition Deir al-Zor Media Centre.

Deiri said that airforce intelligence and military intelligence, two important security compounds in the city, were also located in the nearby Ghazi Ayyash district, and were now within the range of rebel rocket-propelled grenades.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said two rebel fighters were killed in the battles on Tuesday. There were no immediate reports about casualties among Assad's forces.

SECTARIAN BLOODSHED

Another opposition source said rebel strength had been boosted by the arrival of 20 anti-aircraft missiles that came through Turkey for the Ahfad al-Rasul Brigade, a Qatari-backed unit of the rebel Supreme Military Council, which played a major role in the capture of Hawiqa.

"They probably used 2-3 missiles in Hawiqa and have the rest," he said, adding that the rebels mainly used rocket-propelled grenades and a suicide car bomb that destroyed a major checkpoint in the capture of Hawiqa.

Syria's conflict, which has killed more than 100,000 people, began as peaceful protests demanding the toppling of the president. But it is now marred by rising sectarian bloodshed between Sunnis and Alawites, Assad's minority sect which is an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.

Dozens of rebels died last week in the Hawiqa operation as well as 160 members of Assad's forces, opposition sources said. The numbers could not be independently verified.

But Assad's forces still have a distinct advantage in firepower. Heavy artillery based at fortified desert outposts near an oilfield to the south have been hitting Deir al-Zor for months to prevent rebel from consolidating control in the city, the capital of the province of the same name.

Discontent with Assad's Alawite rule in Deir al-Zor, long seen as unimportant to the central power structure, had built up prior to the uprising as water shortages destroyed agriculture and authorities in Damascus withheld infrastructure investment.

Oil production has fallen sharply since the uprising against Assad family rule as various fields fell to a myriad of rebel brigades and Western sanctions have deprived Damascus of its main clients for Syrian crude in Europe.

The only provincial capital to fall completely to the opposition since the uprising erupted in 2011 is Raqqa, 130 km (80 miles) northwest of Deir al-Zor along the Euphrates river.

seekers in southern Thailand escaped from an immigration detention center on Tuesday, highlighting the growing desperation of a stateless minority fleeing sectarian violence in Myanmar.

Rights activists are critical of Thailand's response to the influx of Rohingya and have urged the authorities not to deport the refugees back to Myanmar, where they face pervasive discrimination.

The 87 escapees used blades to cut through iron bars and hacked at cement walls before disappearing into nearby rubber plantations, prompting a large search operation, said Suwit Chernsiri, police commander of the southern province of Songkla.

"The men were detained for many months and tensions were high," Suwit told Reuters. The jail break was the second after a group of 30 escaped from a Songkla police station earlier this month.

More than 1,800 Rohingya who fled Myanmar by sea this past year are being detained across Thailand, often in overcrowded centers and shelters, and thousands more have been intercepted and pushed back out to sea by the Thai authorities.

The deputy interior minister expressed fears that the asylum-seekers would harm locals and discourage tourists from visiting Thailand.

seekers.

"The rest of the burden is left to us."

Myanmar, a majority Buddhist country, says the Rohingya are Muslim migrants from Bangladesh. A 1982 Citizenship Act excluded Rohingya Muslims from a list of 135 designated ethnic groups, effectively rendering them stateless.

Thailand also denies Rohingya citizenship and considers them illegal migrants. Bangladesh also does not recognize them.

Many Rohingya hope to end up in neighboring Muslim-majority Malaysia where some have extended families but often fall prey to smugglers and traffickers in Thailand.

A Reuters investigation found that Rohingya who fail to pay for their passage are handed over to traffickers, who sell some men into slavery on Thai fishing boats or force them to work as farmhands. Thailand's navy denies its personnel are involved in smuggling and trafficking networks.

Wisarn told Reuters that the foreign media were guilty of painting the shelters and detention centers in a bad light and that the Rohingya had a tendency to act up for foreign media.

"They know that it is difficult to go to a third country so when they see foreign journalists, they act up for the cameras."

The number of Rohingya boarding boats from Myanmar and neighboring Bangladesh reached 34,626 people from June 2012 to May of this year - more than four times the previous year, says the Arakan Project, an advocacy group that has studied Rohingya migration since 2006. Many have ended up in Thailand.



headline: Britain rejects Spanish request for Gibraltar talks
byline: By Andrew Osborn
7:26pm EDT

one talks over the sovereignty of the contested British overseas territory of Gibraltar on Tuesday after Spain issued an appeal for such negotiations to be held "as soon as possible".

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo made the appeal in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, but a spokeswoman from British Prime Minister David Cameron's office said London would not enter into any talks on the subject.

"Sovereignty is clear in our minds," said the spokeswoman, saying the only talks Britain could envisage would be between Spain and Gibraltar over fishing practices, but not over the enclave's sovereignty or control of its fishing waters.

A diplomatic war of words over the rocky Mediterranean outpost erupted in July after it built an artificial reef in contested waters using concrete blocks. Spain said the reef restricted access for its fishermen.

Spain lays claim to the territory, which has a population of just 30,000, but which it ceded to Britain by treaty 300 years ago.

"Since the beginning of the current legislature, the Spanish government has urged the UK to resume bilateral negotiations as soon as possible on issues of Gibraltar's sovereignty, which have been on hold for too long," wrote Garcia-Margallo.

Spain tightened border controls in retaliation for the reef and threatened to take further action, including a 50 euro ($67) border levy. The European Commission said on Monday it would send a fact-finding mission to Gibraltar to examine the legitimacy of those controls.

SMOKESCREEN ALLEGATIONS

Opposition parties in Spain and Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo have accused Spain's ruling center-right government of using the conflict as a smokescreen for a corruption scandal involving senior politicians.

Garcia-Margallo reiterated Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's demand for Britain to remove the blocks used for the reef. He said Spain was also open to hosting meetings on the topic between other authorities, like the Gibraltarian government and the local government of neighboring Spanish region Andalusia.

"The dialogue must be bilateral and respect international, European and national laws," he said.

But the British spokesperson made it clear any talks would be limited in scope.

"There needs to be some dialogue on fishing," the spokeswoman said. "But that would not be about who's responsible for the waters as that's clear." Another British spokesman said on Monday that Spain had built similar reefs along its own coastline.

Long queues have formed at the border in recent weeks as the rift over the reef has escalated. Gibraltar is not part of the Schengen open border agreement between some EU member states, meaning Spain is entitled to carry out proportionate checks.

Garcia-Margallo highlighted Spain's concerns about the British territory, including Gibraltar's opaque tax regime and said Spain had initiated proceedings to denounce bunkering, or refueling ships at sea.

The minister said smuggling was also a worry as European Union excise duties do not apply on the rocky outcrop.

Spain has threatened to take its claim on Gibraltar to the United Nations.

headline: Victims of domestic violence face uphill battle for protection in Russia
byline: By Gabriela Baczynska
7:26pm EDT

Yulia endured three years of almost daily rapes and beatings before she fled her husband with her four children, living for the next year in constant fear he would find them.

"I couldn't live in my flat, even though I owned it," the Moscow hairdresser said, too scared to give her full name.

"For a year I rented, but then we ran out of money," she told Reuters at Moscow's only public shelter for battered women, Nadezhda ("Hope").

Fundamentally conservative and guided by the doctrines of a resurgent Orthodox Church, Russia has no legal protections for women like Yulia, believing that family disputes - even violent ones - should be resolved in the home, behind closed doors.

A new draft law would change that by making clear domestic violence is illegal and laying out the rights of victims in Russian law for the first time. Powerful sponsors include parliamentary deputies from United Russia, the party loyal to President Vladimir Putin that dominates the parliament.

But with Putin aiming to shore up support from conservative voters and the church - his political power base - in the face of popular protests, the draft's fate is uncertain.

"This is a cultural problem, a centuries-old mentality in which the man is the head of the family and others obey him or get punished," said Natalia Pazdnikova, a co-author of the draft law and director of Nadezhda. "Russian women are very patient and enduring, ready to suffer for their children and families."

The draft law would introduce the power to issue restraining orders, a common procedure in the West, and give law enforcement officials more training in dealing with abuse. It would also allow police to compel offenders to undergo counseling, require them to report to police up to four times a month, and provide victims with temporary accommodation.

Women's rights activists say that as the situation is now, police, prosecutors and judges in Russia too often advise women seeking help to go home and make peace with their husbands, opening the women up to more physical violence as well as threats and emotional blackmail to drop their complaints.

Two similar draft laws were watered down and then dropped after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Supporters are determined that won't happen this time and hopeful that the law could pass as soon as the end of the year.

Initial signs are not encouraging, however: committees in the lower house have been looking at the draft but there is no date fixed or even estimated for a plenary gathering to start moving forward.

NO DATA

The scale of domestic violence in Russia, a country of about 143 million, is not known because of the lack of official data, another problem the draft law hopes to address.

The World Health Organisation estimates a third of the world's women who have been in a relationship experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner.

Marina Pisklakova-Parker, a recognized expert on the subject as head of ANNA, which pioneered campaigns against domestic violence in Russia in the 1990s, says she believes the figure for Russia is close to that.

Various estimates have put the number of Russian women killed by their husband, partner or a close relative at between 10,000 and 14,000 every year. That would amount to up to a fourth of all murders and violent crimes in Russia, but Reuters was not able to confirm this figure or get more specific data from the Russian police or federal statistics office despite repeated requests.

Police statistics do show some 40 percent of all violent crimes in Russia are committed within families. Yet only 3 percent of domestic violence cases in Russia end in a court sentence, women's rights activists say, basing their estimate on anecdotal experience.

Since domestic violence is not cited in criminal statutes, the onus is on victims to provide evidence for prosecution under statutes covering other crimes, such as assault and battery.

"But domestic violence has its own specifics that go beyond these crimes. It's a particular type of violence since the victim goes on living with her assailant under one roof," said Irina Sokolova, a United Russia lawmaker sponsoring the draft.

"That leads to an intensifying spiral of crime with tens, hundreds of thousands of women falling victim to domestic violence year by year," she said.

FAMILY MATTERS

Putin has not made clear where he stands on the issue. He is widely condemned abroad for introducing more conservative policies on social issues since his return to the Kremlin in 2012, including a law banning gay "propaganda". Criticism at home is more muted.

At a meeting with his core support group, the People's Front, in March, he called for more protection of children at home but made no mention of violence against women.

His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin was not familiar with the draft law and did not know how it would differentiate between violence at home and elsewhere.

ANNA's deputy head Andrei Sinelnikov said women's rights have moved down the political agenda since Putin first rose to power in 2000 and focused more on issues such as living standards and economic growth.

"Even if senior state officials talk women rights, they talk kindergartens and other matters that relate only to a very traditional woman's social role," he said.

The support of the church, which Putin has portrayed as the guardian of national values, is far from certain. Some three quarters of Russians consider themselves Russian Orthodox.

"The problem indeed exists. Women come to priests very often to complain about domestic violence," said Vsevolod Chaplin, head of the church's department for ties with society.

"Some support the law but there are critical voices too that it diverts attention from problems such as alcoholism, narcotics, aggressive mass culture or financial problems."

A leading parents' group, ARKS, plans to campaign against it.

"This is just dangerous," said ARKS head Olga Letkova. "It may destroy families altogether."

Chaplin worried the bill would give law enforcement officials excessive powers to interfere in domestic matters.

"It's best to try safeguard the family and solve the problem at the same time," he said.

"Sometimes there is no other way than to flee but... it's better to try help these people who are already bound together and would suffer even more if they are separated."

HOPE

Yulia was lucky to find protection at Nadezhda, which has just 30 beds for a city of nearly 12 million.

"I don't think I would have made it on my own," she said.

The pastel-colored, two-storey building welcomes visitors with a fountain whose gently falling water is meant to soothe nerves. The shelter's psychologists run therapy classes to help the women overcome their fear.

"I was under so much stress, terrified, it's hard to express," said Amina, 57, who spent four years moving from one home to another with her five-year-old grandson, Islam, who has not spoken since his mother was killed in a family conflict.

Amina, too, finally found refuge at Nadezhda.

"Being able to live here is a great relief," she said.

The shelter welcomed nearly 500 women last year, Pazdnikova said.

"Our practice shows such a law is really needed. It would finally send a clear signal to everybody that domestic violence is not allowed and that there is a clearly defined punishment for it," she said.

Stunned by turmoil in neighboring Egypt and starved of funds, the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas is looking to repair damaged ties with its traditional Middle East allies, Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah party.

An off-shoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas celebrated when the Sunni movement's Mohamed Mursi was elected president of Egypt in 2012, believing the vote would boost its own international standing and its grip on the isolated Gaza Strip.

In the meantime, outraged by the bloody civil war in Syria, the Palestinian group quit its headquarters in Damascus, snapping the Iran-led "axis of resistance" that challenged Israel and the West across the turbulent region.

Shi'ite Muslim Iran, which had for years supplied Hamas with cash and arms, was infuriated by what it saw as a betrayal of its close friend, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and drastically scaled back its support. Tehran's Shi'ite partner, Hezbollah, also voiced its fierce disapproval.

But following the ousting of Mursi, removed by the Egyptian military on July 3, political sources said Hamas had had direct and indirect contacts with both Iran and Hezbollah -- anxious to revitalize old alliances and restore its battered funding.

"Some meetings have taken place ... to clear the air. There is no boycott (of Hamas) but at the same time, things have not yet got back to normal," said a Palestinian official, with knowledge of discussions, who declined to be named.

Moussa Abu Marzouk, former deputy head of Hamas's political office, saw Hezbollah and Iranian officials in Lebanon last month, with other meetings taking place subsequently.

"It is in the interest of Hamas today to revise its rapport with Iran and Hezbollah for many reasons," said Hani Habib, a political analyst based in the Gaza Strip. "At the end of the day, all the parties have an interest in this partnership."

SYRIA ROW

Locked in conflict with arch foe and neighbor Israel, which it refuses to recognize, Hamas has governed the small, densely populated Gaza Strip since 2007 after a brief civil war against its secular rivals.

With the Muslim Brotherhood in control of Egypt, Hamas felt it did not have to worry so much about its ties with Iran.

Hamas's leader in exile, Khaled Meshaal abandoned his long-time base in Damascus last year because of the civil war that pitted President Assad's forces, backed by reinforcements sent by both Iran and Hezbollah, against mainly Sunni rebels.

Shi'ite and Sunni are the main streams of Islam. There are differences in their interpretations of the Koran and some traditions. The majority of the world's Muslims are Sunni.

One of the veteran leaders of Hamas, Mahmoud Al-Zahar, said there had never been a suspension of relations with Tehran and Hezbollah, suggesting that contacts may have slowed only because of the recent presidential election in Iran.

"We do not yet know the nature of Iran's new policy, but the information we have received, which is not direct, suggests that the old policy will be endorsed by the new administration," Zahar, a renowned hardliner, told Reuters in an interview.

Hamas hopes newly installed President Hassan Rouhani will open the financial taps again.

Diplomats estimated that Iran used to give Hamas some $250 million a year, but one Palestinian official reckoned that only 20 percent of that was now being handed over. Ehud Yaari, a Middle East expert from Israel, put the figure at just 15 percent, with no arms being offered up either.

"We have a situation of close to zero arms trafficking through the tunnels into Gaza," said Yaari.

Very little material, weapons or otherwise, is passing at present through the smuggling tunnels that criss-cross the desert border between Egypt and Gaza, with the new rulers in Cairo ordering a clampdown following Mursi's removal.

The army-backed government has accused Hamas of interfering in Egyptian affairs and suggested that Palestinians might be helping Islamist militants active in the Sinai peninsula.

The restrictions on the tunnels, which flourished thanks to an Israeli blockade on the coastal enclave, cost Gaza at least $230 million in July alone, said Hamas Economy Minister Ala Al-Rafati. But he rejected any suggestion of a financial crisis.

"There are some problems and they are being overcome," he told Reuters on Monday, adding that the tunnel trade, which provides Hamas with a crucial source of tax income, had dropped some 60 percent since Mursi's ousting.

In an additional blow, Hamas's close ties with Qatar have also been dented this summer.

The emir of the energy-rich Gulf state visited Gaza last October promising millions of dollars of aid, but he abdicated in June and his heir has shown much less interest in Hamas.

PRIORITIES

In reaching out once more to Iran and Hezbollah, Hamas's dilemma is as much ideological as political -- how to balance its Sunni Muslim Brotherhood roots with its vital interests to forge partnerships with fellow enemies of Israel.

Leading a special prayer meeting on Friday for the souls of the "Egyptian martyrs", the Hamas prime minister in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, made clear that the war with Israel took precedence.

"We understand that the priority of our resistance is to liberate the land, regain the rights and return the Palestinian people to the land they were forced out of," said Haniyeh, the movement's deputy chief.

"We have no military and no security role in Egypt or in the Sinai. Our military and security role is here, on the land of Palestine and against the Zionist enemy."

Founded in 1988, Hamas has regularly squared off against Israel, most recently in November last year in an eight-day conflagration that killed at least 170 Palestinians and six Israelis. The truce was brokered by Mursi.

Israeli analyst Yaari thought Iran would exact a price for welcoming Hamas back into the fold. "It will require them to stop opposing Assad and stop any criticism of Hezbollah's intervention (in Syria) and Iranian support of Assad," he said.

Zahar, who lost two sons in the conflict against Israel in past years and carries great weight in the movement, has always sought to maintain good ties with Iran.

But he also says the organization, which is estimated to have around 30,000 well-equipped fighters, has survived difficult situations in the past when U.S.-backed strongman Hosni Mubarak ruled Egypt and kept Gaza in a vice.

"We became very strong in an era where the entire surrounding environment was hostile," he said. "Our resistance relies mainly on God and also on its capabilities. History proved we have always emerged stronger every time."
