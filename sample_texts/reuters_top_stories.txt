headline: America's Diana Nyad, 64, sets record with Cuba-to-Florida swim

distance swimmer Diana Nyad on Monday became the first person to swim across the Florida Straits from Cuba without a shark cage, succeeding on her fifth attempt at the feat.

Her face sunburned and lips swollen, with barely enough energy to speak, Nyad waded ashore at Key West after a 53-hour swim and delivered a simple message to onlookers: "We should never, ever give up .... You never are too old to chase your dreams."

In an inspiration to Baby Boomers everywhere, Nyad completed the estimated 110-mile (177-km) journey after departing from Havana on Saturday morning. She set a record for the longest ocean swim without a shark cage or flippers, according to her crew.

She was met by crowds in Key West who surrounded her, snapping photos, as they enjoyed sunny beach weather on the annual Labor Day holiday.

Helpers were waiting to give her medical treatment and immediately placed her on a stretcher and hydrated her with an IV before she was taken to a hospital.

The iron-willed Nyad had been trying to achieve the crossing for 35 years, describing it on her website as her "Xtreme Dream," and seemed determined to prove The Beatles were right that there is plenty to live for "when I'm 64."

"Diana shows that at any age you can do whatever you want," said Nancy Jordan, 57, a volunteer pilot on one of Nyad's support vessels. "That's what she set out to show; don't ever give up your dream."

Dave Magmone, whose boat was used to prepare Nyad's meals, said, "She has a mental and physical strength like no one I have ever known. She is an example for all people, regardless of their age."

Women and men of a certain age have been inspired in recent years by a wave of older athletes breaking records and snagging headlines.

Last year, then Colorado Rockies player Jamie Moyer, now 50, became the oldest pitcher in Major League Baseball history to win a game. Canadian Ed Whitlock, now 82, shattered records when he ran the 2012 Toronto Marathon in 3 hours 30 minutes. And Dana Torres in 2008 at age 41 became the oldest-ever American female swimmer to win an Olympic medal.

"I think this is the prime. When one reaches this age, you still have a body that's strong but now you have a better mind," Nyad told CNN before a previous failed attempt to making the crossing in 2011.

JELLYFISH, SHARKS

Nyad's team said her fifth attempt at the Florida crossing benefited from several key factors, including calm seas, the surprising lack of jellyfish and favorable currents in the powerful Gulf Stream that flows eastwards through the Florida Straits.

"You can't do the swim unless you have three things - the determination, the weather and the cooperation of the Gulf Stream," said Ron Bartlett, her navigator.

Bartlett said the crew only encountered one minor squall during the crossing and only one deadly box jellyfish sighting.

The marathon swimmer had said this was her final attempt, this time equipped with a protective silicone mask as well as a body suit to better protect her from box jellyfish that forced her to end one of two attempted crossings last year.

A team of ocean kayakers and divers accompanied Nyad on her journey dragging an electronic device in the water that emitted a current to repel sharks.

Nyad has spent much of her life in the water. She described in a 2011 YouTube documentary how her father told her when she was a young girl she was destined to swim, noting that her last name is derived from the Greek word for water nymphs or female swimmers.

Born in New York, the multi-lingual Nyad was raised in south Florida by a French mother and Greek-Egyptian stepfather and swam six hours a day as a 12-year-old.

She retired after successfully completing a swim from Bimini in the Bahamas to Florida in 1979, ending a long-distance career that set several world records including one for circling Manhattan in less than eight hours in 1975.

She went on to a career in sports journalism and fitness and has expressed a lifelong fascination with Cuba.

The treacherous Florida Straits has been conquered only twice previously, both times with the aid of a protective cage. The last time was by Australian Susie Maroney, who used a protective cage at age 22 during a 1997 swim. The cage glided on ocean currents and enabled Maroney to make the journey in just 25 hours.

Nyad's fifth attempt to make the crossing comes 35 years after she made her first go at it aged 28 in 1978, when she gave up after covering 76 miles in 42 hours, with the aid that time of a shark cage.

With Key West in her sights on Monday Nyad halted briefly about 2 miles offshore to thank her support team.

"This is a lifelong dream of mine and I'm very, very glad to be with you," she said, according to her website. "So let's get going so we can have a whopping party."



headline: Slow pace of justice wears down Occupy Wall Street defendants
byline: By Joseph Ax
12:12am EDT

Occupy Wall Street protesters who once vowed to "occupy" the courts by challenging their arrests on minor violations have since been defeated by the slow pace of justice, with many forgoing trial.

As Occupy's two-year anniversary approaches on September 17, the movement that once captivated national attention has largely faded.

Hundreds of protesters campaigning against economic inequality set up a makeshift encampment in a downtown Manhattan park, inspiring dozens of similar sites across the country. Police eventually cleared the New York City park in a late-night raid.

More than 2,600 arrests were made in Manhattan in connection with Occupy, including 700 on the Brooklyn Bridge on October 1.

Approximately half of all defendants accepted offers from the Manhattan District Attorney's office to dismiss the charges if they avoided arrest for six months. Hundreds more took plea deals. Overall, fewer than 70 cases reached trial, less than 3 percent of the total; 53 resulted in convictions.

Sixteen cases remained as of August, according to statistics tracked by the district attorney's office.

Many defendants found it too onerous to return time and again for court dates at the overburdened New York City Criminal Court, which handles hundreds of thousands cases a year, even when they felt their arrests were illegitimate, said Martin Stolar, a National Lawyers Guild attorney who handled hundreds of cases.

"What is the best use of your time?" Stolar said he asked several clients. "Is it coming to court and fighting the case, or is it moving on and continuing to do the political work that led you to the Occupy movement in the first place?"

For nearly two years after her arrest on the Brooklyn Bridge during an Occupy Wall Street march, Karina Garcia refused to accept a plea deal.

At her ninth court appearance in June, tears came to her eyes after the judge told her to come back again in two months. Finally, the judge ruled earlier this month that prosecutors had taken too long to bring her to trial and threw out her case.

"I was like, is this really happening? Is it finally over?" said Garcia, a schoolteacher at the time of her arrest. "It's been a very punitive process."

The vast majority of arrested protesters were charged with minor infractions, such as disorderly conduct or blocking vehicular traffic.

At the time, many protesters said they would fight the charges and press for trials. Court officials designated a special courtroom, and the Manhattan District Attorney's office assigned a team of prosecutors.

Some of the few cases that still endure have lasted more than 10 times as long as the encampment did.

"It's been a much slower process than I ever imagined," said Justin Adkins, 35, who traveled several hours from Williamstown, Massachusetts, to 10 court appearances before his case was also tossed out for speedy trial violations.

FLOOD OF CASES

As Garcia, Adkins and hundreds of other protesters were getting arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge, Assistant District Attorney Nitin Savur's Blackberry began buzzing.

A week earlier, police had arrested nearly 100 people during an Occupy demonstration in Union Square, and prosecutors knew they could soon have a flood of cases.

"We started realizing, this is not going to be one or two arrests each day," said Savur, the deputy chief for the office's trial division.

Savur and other senior prosecutors decided to appoint an experienced assistant, Michele Bayer, as "protest supervisor" and assigned two assistants to handle all Occupy-related cases.

The model proved successful, Savur said, enough that the office has designated a protest supervisor for other large-scale events, such as city parades, that could result in mass arrests. Overall, judges dismissed only a handful of cases for speedy trial reasons.

Still, the Occupy cases inched along, sometimes delayed for months at a time, a pace that defense lawyers said was common at Manhattan Criminal Court.

The grind that confronts criminal defendants was a revelation for Occupy defendants, many of whom were white, first-time offenders.

"People with very little experience with the criminal justice system see how it works, and they're astounded," said Stolar, the defense lawyer.

The Occupy cases included many defendants who were initially reluctant to accept deals. In addition, cases that involve defendants in jail are given priority, pushing Occupy cases further back in line.

Occupy cases typically involved lengthy pre-trial proceedings as defense lawyers argued their clients were simply exercising their right to free expression.

"These are not your run-of-the-mill, drinking-a-beer-on-the-sidewalk cases," said Justin Barry, the chief clerk for New York City Criminal Court. "These defendants had issues they wanted to bring up with the judge, and that takes time."

"With all the experience I have in this ocean, I never knew I would suffer the way I did," Nyad told CNN in an interview.

The first day was especially difficult because of winds and "even people with iron will quit when it's really tough," said Nyad, her lips swollen from exposure and from the mouthpiece of a prosthetic mask used to protect her from deadly box jellyfish.

She said she told herself, "Forget about surface up ... With your left hand push Cuba back and push Florida toward you."

Dave Magmone, whose boat was used to prepare Nyad's meals, said: "She has a mental and physical strength like no one I have ever known. She is an example for all people, regardless of their age."

headline: Record-breaking San Francisco Bay bridge to open after delays
byline: By Laila Kearney
12:12am EDT

anchored suspension bridge in the world will open before Tuesday morning's rush hour across San Francisco Bay, six years behind schedule and five times over budget.

The new $6 billion eastern section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, one of the busiest spans in the United States, is expected to be open on Tuesday for 280,000 daily commuters. The Bay Area Toll Authority said the bridge could open as soon as Monday night.

The San Francisco-to-Oakland bridge was shut to traffic last Wednesday to complete construction and build connections from the new eastern stretch to the existing toll plaza and the bay's Yerba Buena Island.

The single-towered, 2,047-foot-long (634-metre) self-anchored main span is more than twice the length of the previous record holders, Japan's Konohana Bridge and South Korea's Yeongjong Grand Bridge, according to the Structurae engineering database.

A self-anchored suspension bridge has its main cables fixed to its deck. A traditional suspension bridge is anchored to the ground.

The opening follows years of delays prompted by design disputes, financial struggles and safety issues. It also comes two decades after its predecessor partly collapsed in a 1989 earthquake.

In March, a survey found that 32 of more than 2,300 steel rods used to help the 2.2-mile (3.5-km) eastern span of the bridge withstand earthquakes were broken.

The cost of the retrofitting was estimated between $5 million and $10 million. Placeholder plate stabilizers are being used to keep the bridge open before the rods are permanently replaced in December.

The bridge will feature a single 525-foot (160-metre) tower and a bicycle path, points of contention when the bridge was being planned.

Once the new stretch is opened, it will take about three years to demolish the old span, bridge officials said in a statement.

The eastern section of the bridge reaches from Yerba Buena Island to Oakland. The western stretch links downtown San Francisco to the island.

The east span will include east- and westbound traffic on side-by-side decks. The west span will continue to have decks placed above and below one another.

headline: Rodman returns to Pyongyang but says won't bring back jailed American

day visit to North Korea, his second this year, but said he had no plans to negotiate the release of a jailed American missionary.

There had been speculation that Rodman, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in March, would secure the release of Kenneth Bae who was jailed for 15 years for trying to overthrow the North Korean government.

"I'm not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae," Rodman told Reuters in a telephone interview. "I'm just going there on another basketball diplomacy tour."

Kim, the third of his line to rule North Korea is a basketball fan and appeared to get on well with Rodman on the earlier visit, with the two of them pictured laughing, eating and drinking together and watching an all-star basketball match.

Rodman's latest trip is being sponsored by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power.

"I've come out here to see my friend (Kim) - and I want to talk about basketball," he added, speaking from Beijing, the usual transit point for flights into Pyongyang.

North Korea canceled a visit by Robert King, U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues, to Pyongyang last week on what the U.S. State Department said was a "humanitarian mission" to negotiate the release of Bae.

King's trip was initially seen as a signal that relations between Washington and Pyongyang might start to improve. North Korea said it withdrew the invitation because of annual military drills last week by the United States and South Korea.

Rodman drew fire for his earlier trip to Pyongyang at a time when North Korea was threatening the United States, South Korea and Japan with missile strikes.

He called Kim, 30, who rules unchallenged in a country where there are an estimated 150,000-200,000 prisoners in work camps, "an awesome kid".

Bae, a Korean American who had been working as a Christian missionary in China and North Korea, was arrested in the northeast port city of Rason late last year.

The North Korean supreme court said it sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor for plotting to overthrow the state. It said he had secretly brought "propaganda materials", including a National Geographic documentary on life in North Korea, into the isolated country.

Bae, who had trained with missionary organization Youth With a Mission, ran a tour group called Nation Tours in China that specialized in trips to North Korea. In a video of a 2009 sermon to a Korean-American church in St. Louis, Bae said he planned to bring fellow Christians into Rason.

North Korea says it permits religious freedom, but religious expression is tightly controlled in a state that acknowledges total loyalty to the Kim dynasty that has ruled for three generations. North Korea lands at the bottom of most independent surveys of freedom.

Bae's family has acknowledged his deeply held religious beliefs but have suggested that his sympathy for North Korean orphans may have been behind his arrest.

anchored suspension bridge in the world will open before Tuesday morning's rush hour across San Francisco Bay, six years behind schedule and five times over budget.

The new $6 billion eastern section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, one of the busiest spans in the United States, is expected to be open on Tuesday for 280,000 daily commuters. The Bay Area Toll Authority said the bridge could open as soon as Monday night.

The San Francisco-to-Oakland bridge was shut to traffic last Wednesday to complete construction and build connections from the new eastern stretch to the existing toll plaza and the bay's Yerba Buena Island.

The single-towered, 2,047-foot-long (634-metre) self-anchored main span is more than twice the length of the previous record holders, Japan's Konohana Bridge and South Korea's Yeongjong Grand Bridge, according to the Structurae engineering database.

A self-anchored suspension bridge has its main cables fixed to its deck. A traditional suspension bridge is anchored to the ground.

The opening follows years of delays prompted by design disputes, financial struggles and safety issues. It also comes two decades after its predecessor partly collapsed in a 1989 earthquake.

In March, a survey found that 32 of more than 2,300 steel rods used to help the 2.2-mile (3.5-km) eastern span of the bridge withstand earthquakes were broken.

The cost of the retrofitting was estimated between $5 million and $10 million. Placeholder plate stabilizers are being used to keep the bridge open before the rods are permanently replaced in December.

The bridge will feature a single 525-foot (160-metre) tower and a bicycle path, points of contention when the bridge was being planned.

Once the new stretch is opened, it will take about three years to demolish the old span, bridge officials said in a statement.

The eastern section of the bridge reaches from Yerba Buena Island to Oakland. The western stretch links downtown San Francisco to the island.

The east span will include east- and westbound traffic on side-by-side decks. The west span will continue to have decks placed above and below one another.

headline: Rodman returns to Pyongyang but says won't bring back jailed American

day visit to North Korea, his second this year, but said he had no plans to negotiate the release of a jailed American missionary.

There had been speculation that Rodman, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in March, would secure the release of Kenneth Bae who was jailed for 15 years for trying to overthrow the North Korean government.

"I'm not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae," Rodman told Reuters in a telephone interview. "I'm just going there on another basketball diplomacy tour."

Kim, the third of his line to rule North Korea is a basketball fan and appeared to get on well with Rodman on the earlier visit, with the two of them pictured laughing, eating and drinking together and watching an all-star basketball match.

Rodman's latest trip is being sponsored by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power.

"I've come out here to see my friend (Kim) - and I want to talk about basketball," he added, speaking from Beijing, the usual transit point for flights into Pyongyang.

North Korea canceled a visit by Robert King, U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues, to Pyongyang last week on what the U.S. State Department said was a "humanitarian mission" to negotiate the release of Bae.

King's trip was initially seen as a signal that relations between Washington and Pyongyang might start to improve. North Korea said it withdrew the invitation because of annual military drills last week by the United States and South Korea.

Rodman drew fire for his earlier trip to Pyongyang at a time when North Korea was threatening the United States, South Korea and Japan with missile strikes.

He called Kim, 30, who rules unchallenged in a country where there are an estimated 150,000-200,000 prisoners in work camps, "an awesome kid".

Bae, a Korean American who had been working as a Christian missionary in China and North Korea, was arrested in the northeast port city of Rason late last year.

The North Korean supreme court said it sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor for plotting to overthrow the state. It said he had secretly brought "propaganda materials", including a National Geographic documentary on life in North Korea, into the isolated country.

Bae, who had trained with missionary organization Youth With a Mission, ran a tour group called Nation Tours in China that specialized in trips to North Korea. In a video of a 2009 sermon to a Korean-American church in St. Louis, Bae said he planned to bring fellow Christians into Rason.

North Korea says it permits religious freedom, but religious expression is tightly controlled in a state that acknowledges total loyalty to the Kim dynasty that has ruled for three generations. North Korea lands at the bottom of most independent surveys of freedom.

Bae's family has acknowledged his deeply held religious beliefs but have suggested that his sympathy for North Korean orphans may have been behind his arrest.



headline: Firefighters gain an edge on wildfire in Yosemite National Park
byline: By Laila Kearney
12:12am EDT

Firefighters in California gained ground on Monday against a massive wildfire burning part of Yosemite National Park, although complete containment may be weeks away, officials said.

Crews working through the night got an edge on the so-called Rim Fire, a 350-square mile (906-square km) blaze that has charred the California park's Northwest, said Andrea Capps, spokeswoman for the Rim Fire command center.

They connected containment lines near the fire's northwestern and western borders, where most of the 4,500 homes threatened by the blaze are located, she said.

The fire was 60 percent contained by early Monday, a 15 percent increase from the night before.

"Last night is when it all really tied together," Capps said. "It's looking really good over there right now. They're calling that containment line secure."

Despite the jump in containment, Capps said fire analysts estimate that it could take until September 20 to contain the Rim Fire fully. Steep terrain and high, unpredictable winds will likely pose the main challenges in digging and burning containment lines around the blaze.

"The majority of the containment lines will probably be really strong by the middle, end of this week, but they just want to give themselves enough time to make sure it's fully contained," Capps said.

Wet weather expected in the area on Monday raised hopes, but the possibility of thunderstorms kept officials wary.

"Rain is good, but the winds that come with the pressure changes with the thunderstorms could lead to some unpredictable (fire) behavior," Capps said. "We have had a few sprinkles this morning, and so we're all waiting to see what happens."

While the majority of the fire was burning on Stanislaus National Forest, 60,214 acres, or about 27 percent, of the fire has crossed the Yosemite National Park border.

The massive blaze has scorched an area larger than many U.S. cities and is the fourth-largest on record in California, burning more than 220,000 acres over the past two weeks.

Over the past several years, wildfires in the U.S. West have become increasingly frequent and at times deadly. Earlier this year, 19 firefighters were killed in a blaze in Arizona, and wildfires have raged in several states, including Nevada, Alaska and New Mexico.



headline: Obama and aides confront skeptical Congress on Syria strike

weary American public.

Obama made a series of calls to members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with more scheduled for Monday, underscoring the task confronting the administration before it can go ahead with using force in response to a deadly chemical attack blamed on the Syrian government.

Dozens of lawmakers, some in tennis shirts or shirtsleeves, cut short their vacations and streamed into the corridors of the Capitol building for a Sunday afternoon intelligence briefing on Syria with Obama's national security team.

When they emerged nearly three hours later, there was no immediate sign that the many skeptics in Congress had changed their minds.

"I am very concerned about taking America into another war against a country that hasn't attacked us," said Representative Janice Hahn, a California Democrat. On the way out of the briefing, she said the participants appeared "evenly divided" on whether to give Obama approval.

None expressed doubts that Syria had engaged in chemical warfare. "The searing image of babies lined up dead, that's what I can't get out of my mind right now," Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz said after the closed-door briefing.

But the credibility of the administration's intelligence is turning out to be a less important issue than the nature and usefulness of the response.

Earlier in the day, Secretary of State John Kerry invoked the crimes of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein and warned of a potential threat to Israel a day after Obama's decision to delay an imminent attack on Syrian targets and allow Congress to vote on it first.

Even as Kerry took to the airwaves touting new evidence that deadly sarin gas was used in the August 21 chemical attack near Damascus, the scope of the challenge confronting the administration became apparent.

Lawmakers raised a broad array of concerns, including the potential effectiveness of limited strikes, the possible unintended consequence of dragging the United States into another open-ended Middle East conflict, the wisdom of acting without broader international backing to share the burden and the war fatigue of the American public.

Many in Congress have been able to avoid taking a position on the merits of a military strike, focusing instead on demands that Obama consult them and seek their approval.

While Kerry predicted Obama would win the endorsement he wants, a growing cacophony of congressional critics - ranging from liberal Democratic doves to Republican Tea Party conservatives - illustrated just how hard that will be.

At the same time, Kerry, the administration's most impassioned voice for intervention in Syria's 2-1/2-year civil war, was left to publicly defend Obama's stunning reversal, a decision that puts any strike on hold for at least nine days.

"This is squarely now in the hands of Congress," Kerry told CNN, saying he had confidence "they will do what is right because they understand the stakes."

In a round of television appearances, Kerry declined to say whether Obama would go ahead with military action if Congress rejects the president's request, as Britain's parliament did last week to derail London's role in any Syria military operation.

But, echoing Obama's comments in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, he insisted the president had the right to act on his own if he chooses that course.

Obama is taking a gamble by putting the brakes on the military assault that he considers essential to maintain U.S. credibility after Assad crossed the "red line" set against the use of chemical weapons.

MORE EVIDENCE

The consensus on Capitol Hill is that Obama has a good chance of winning approval in the Democratic-led Senate, but the vote appears too close to call in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where the president's opponents rarely miss an opportunity to block him.

Acknowledging that the administration has its work cut out for it to persuade some lawmakers, Kerry insisted they could not "have it both ways" by demanding a voice in the matter and then abdicating responsibility to uphold the international bans on chemical weapons use.

Kerry used the television appearances to provide further evidence backing accusations against the Syrian government.

"I can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin," Kerry told CNN's "State of the Union."

It was the first time the administration had pinpointed what kind of chemical was used in the attack on a rebel-held area, which U.S. intelligence agencies said killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children.

"So this case is building and this case will build," Kerry told NBC's "Face the Nation."

OBAMA'S DILEMMA

Obama's efforts are sure to be hampered by his dismal relations with congressional Republicans. Another bitter face-off on government spending is looming this autumn.

Lawmakers for the most part welcomed Obama's decision to consult them, but looked in no hurry to reconvene early from their summer recess, which lasts until September 9.

Comments from leading Republicans and Democrats indicated how complex the debate will be - and raised doubts whether Obama would win their authorization.

Underscoring a sense of wariness even from Obama's traditional allies, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said the Vermont Democrat believes that the use-of-force resolution offered by the White House is too broad and that new language will be written for consideration.

Mike Rogers, Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN: "I think there are some real challenges. I think that at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion. This is a national security issue."

Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, speaking on NBC, took a more skeptical view.

While saying he was "proud" of Obama for coming to Congress for authority, Paul said, "It's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down the involvement in the Syrian war."

"I think the Senate will rubber stamp what he wants," he said. "The House will be a much closer vote." The Senate is controlled by Obama's Democratic Party, the House is in the hands of the Republican Party.

Republican Senator John McCain said he was not sure Obama's request would pass, but made clear his view that tougher military action was needed than the limited cruise missile strikes that the Obama administration is preparing.

Republican Representative Peter King of New York said it was unclear if lawmakers would sign off on an attack on Syria, but he warned Obama may have to overcome "the isolationist wing" of the Republican Party to prevail.

Seeking to lay the groundwork for what is expected to be a heated congressional debate, Kerry tipped his hand on one tactic the administration will use - linking the congressional vote to safeguarding U.S. ally Israel from the Syrian chemical weapons threat.

"I don't think they will want to vote, ultimately, to put Israel at risk," Kerry said.

Lawmakers of both major political parties recognize how important it is to be seen as defenders of Israel, especially at election time, when they compete to show voters who is a better friend of the Jewish state.



headline: Limits put on how long U.S. Naval midshipman in rape case must testify
byline: By Lacey Johnson
4:46am EDT

The military officer presiding at a hearing on accusations by a U.S. Naval Academy midshipman that she was raped by three academy football players agreed on Sunday to limit the amount of testimony she must give, after her lawyers complained she was exhausted.

The female midshipman said she was sexually assaulted in April 2012 while she was blacked out after drinking too much at an off-campus "football house" party in Annapolis, Maryland, site of the elite academy. Tra'ves Bush, 22; Eric Graham, 21; and Joshua Tate, 21, have been charged.

The ruling on her testimony came at a so-called Article 32 hearing to determine if the men should be court-martialed.

The woman in this case, now a Naval Academy senior, had been questioned, with periodic breaks, by defense attorneys for more than 20 hours since Wednesday afternoon, with one hearing lasting more than 12 hours.

Lawyers for the woman said she could not give clear and accurate testimony because she was so exhausted by the long hours spent on the witness stand.

On Sunday, the investigating officer presiding over the hearing, Commander Robert Monahan, granted a request to limit her time on the stand to between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., or essentially to no more than nine hours a day.

She will also be entitled to take breaks from the testimony at least every 90 minutes.

The woman, who was a 20-year-old sophomore at the time of the alleged incident, was initially uncooperative with investigators. In explanation, she said she did not want to get anyone in trouble and that she feared her mother would force her to leave the school.

Reuters generally does not report the names of sexual assault victims.

During cross examination of the woman on Sunday a lawyer for Tate argued that the woman was not sufficiently afraid of Tate considering the allegations because the summer after the alleged rape, she got on a boat at a party where Tate was present. She went inside the boat with him and had a conversation with him.

"Would it be fair to say you weren't intimidated by Josh Tate at his point in time?" the lawyer, Jason Ehrenburg, asked. She responded: "I felt ... I had no reason to be intimidated at that specific instance."

She was also questioned at length on Sunday by Graham's attorney, Lieutenant Commander Angela Tang, as to whether she deleted her Twitter account to hide potential evidence from investigators - an allegation she denied.

The woman said she filed an assault report at the urging of a fellow student and volunteered to accept punishment for underage drinking. She sought legal help in early 2013.

Bush, Graham and Tate, none of them any longer on the school's football team, are also charged with making false statements. Bush's graduation in May was put on hold pending the outcome of the case. Graham is a senior, and Tate is a junior.

President Barack Obama's efforts to convince Congress to back his plan to attack Syria met with skepticism on Monday from lawmakers in his own Democratic Party who expressed concern the United States would be dragged into a new Middle East conflict.

Obama appeared to make some headway, however, with two influential Republican senators, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who came out of a White House meeting with him convinced that the president is willing to do more than simply fire off cruise missiles and also wants to bolster the Syrian opposition.

McCain, long an advocate of a more robust U.S. approach to Syria, said failure to get behind strikes against President Bashar al-Assad would be "catastrophic."

Obama's abrupt decision to halt plans for a strike against Assad's forces and instead wait for congressional approval has generated a raging debate just as the president prepares to go to Sweden and Russia this week.

Armed with evidence they say proves Syria's government killed over 1,400 people with nerve agent sarin, Obama's top national security aides made their case to Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives in a 70-minute conference call, urging them to back Obama's request.

The White House argument is that Syria must be punished for the August 21 chemical weapons onslaught and that at stake is the integrity of an international ban on such weapons and the need to safeguard U.S. national security interests and allies Israel, Jordan and Turkey.

Syria has blamed the attack on rebel forces.

As with much in which the divided Congress involves itself, there was deep disagreement on how to proceed, with some lawmakers worried the United States might be drawn into yet another Middle Eastern conflict in spite of Obama's pledges for a limited strike.

Overshadowing the debate are the ghosts of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, conflicts that lasted far longer and were far more expensive than first predicted. Congressional hesitancy reflects the overall weariness of war among Americans, who oppose getting involved in Syria.

Representative Chris Van Hollen, a senior Democrat and an ally of Obama on many issues, complained that the wording of the White House's request to Congress for the authorization of the use of force was too open-ended and could lead to deep U.S. involvement in Syria, where more than 100,000 people have died in more than two years of conflict.

"There is no limitation on putting American soldiers on the ground. There is no end point" on the resolution, he said. "The draft resolution presented by the administration is overly broad, it provides too much of a blank check to the executive," he said.

Van Hollen was among Democratic lawmakers briefed by conference call by Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, national security adviser Susan Rice, intelligence director James Clapper and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

OPPOSITION IN BOTH PARTIES

Obama needs to shore up his left wing, particularly in the House, where liberal Democrats and many conservative "Tea Party" Republicans are both opposed to more U.S. military action in the Middle East.

McCain and Graham are from the more traditional wing of the Republican Party that generally favors U.S. intervention abroad when deemed necessary. They want a broad strategy not just to punish Assad for the chemical weapons attack but to help Syria's rebels.

The Democratic-led Senate is expected to approve U.S. military action, but failing to win the support of McCain and Graham would be a blow to Obama's wider influence over Congress on Syria.

"I guess the way I would term the conversation is that there is a consensus being formed that we need to degrade Assad's capabilities and upgrade the Syrian opposition," Graham told reporters when he and McCain emerged from a one-hour White House meeting with Obama.

Representative James McGovern, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, said he was skeptical that Obama's plan for military strikes could help end the war in Syria. If the vote were taken today, he would vote no.

"People are horrified by the pictures of people suffering and they genuinely want to help. But people have become, it's more than just war-weary, they've become skeptical of the effectiveness of these military involvements," he said.

With Navy ships in place and ready to launch cruise missiles on Obama's order, no decision was likely until days after Congress returns from its summer recess on September 9. In the interim, Obama is using the time to build his case.

Washington's hesitancy has prompted mocking comments from Syrian leaders and a push from Assad's chief backer, Russia, to send members of the Russian parliament to the U.S. capital to argue against a strike.

Obama's gamble to seek congressional backing carries many risks, chief among them is that Congress will again thwart him and make him look weak around the world.

It may depend on building a majority House vote based on Obama's fellow Democrats joining those Republicans who support action, a senior House Republican aide told Reuters on Sunday.

"It's too early to speculate" what the House will do, the aide said, "but (House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi) is going to have to post a big number" among her members in support of it. The aide declined to predict how big.

Republicans hold the House, 233-200, with two vacancies.

headline: USS Nimitz carrier group sails into Red Sea in 'prudent' move
byline: By Andrea Shalal-Esa
12:12am EDT

The USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and four other ships in its strike group moved into the Red Sea early on Monday, U.S. defense officials said, describing the move as "prudent planning" in case the ships are needed for military action against Syria.

The officials said the Nimitz entered the Red Sea around 6 a.m. EDT (1000 GMT), but the strike group had not received any orders to move into the Mediterranean, where five U.S. destroyers and an amphibious ship, the USS San Antonio, remain poised for possible cruise missile strikes against Syria.

Moving the Nimitz into the Red Sea was aimed at putting more U.S. assets in place if they are needed to support what U.S. officials still describe as a limited attack against Syria after it used chemical weapons against civilians.

"It does place that strike group in a position to respond to a variety of contingencies," said one official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.

The nuclear-powered Nimitz is accompanied by the Princeton, a cruiser, and three destroyers - the William P. Lawrence, Stockdale and Shoup, according to the officials.

They said there had been no change regarding six U.S. Navy ships now in the eastern Mediterranean, but military planners were reassessing the situation given a delay in the cruise missile strikes that had been expected this past weekend.

President Barack Obama on Saturday backed off imminent strikes by the destroyers off the coast of Syria until Congress had time to vote its approval. Defense officials said the delay gave them more time to reassess which ships and other weapons will be kept in the region - and whether some may be allowed to leave. Congress returns to Washington September 9.

The U.S. Navy doubled its presence in the eastern Mediterranean in the past week, effectively adding two destroyers to the three that generally patrol the region, and diverting the San Antonio, which carries four massive CH-53 helicopters and 300 Marines, from another mission.

Two of the destroyers were due to be relieved but are now serving along with the ships that were to replace them.

PRUDENT DEPLOYMENT

It was not immediately clear how long those ships would be asked to remain in the eastern Mediterranean, but officials suggested that changes could be made to the current fleet there in coming days.

The destroyers are carrying a combined load of about 200 Tomahawk missiles, but officials say a limited strike on Syria could be accomplished with half that number.

Retired Admiral Gary Roughead, who served as chief of naval operations during the 2011 strikes on Libya, said the Navy's decision to move the carrier into the Red Sea meant it was closer to the "points of tension."

"It's a prudent move that provides for maximum naval flexibility in the region," Roughead, who is now a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, told Reuters. "It is not unusual to move carriers around in North Arabian Sea and Red Sea as events dictate."

Reuters reported Sunday that officials had rerouted the Nimitz carrier group, which was due to sail east around Asia to return to its home port in Everett, Washington, after being relieved in recent days by another aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman.

Officials said the USS Kearsarge, a large-deck amphibious ship, remained in North Arabian Sea, and there were no plans to move the ship into the Red Sea.

The Kearsarge, which carries 6 AV-8B Harriers, 10-12 V-22 Ospreys and helicopters, played a key role in the 2011 strikes on Libya. Two Ospreys launched from the ship helped rescue a downed F-15 pilot during that operation.

century ago are believed to have been secretly buried.

"We have found evidence of burial hardware - hinges on coffins," said Dr. Christian Wells, an anthropologist from the University of South Florida, in a briefing about a mile from the closed excavation site near the former Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys.

"There appear to be a few pieces associated with burial shrouds, and there are pins consistent with the 1920s and 1930s, - based on the style of the pins - and they appear to be brass," he said.

Some "large-bone fragments" were found on the first day of digging, Wells said. They were human bones, he added, but it was impossible to know if they came from any of the teenaged boys who were housed at Dozier during its infamous 111-year existence. The school was closed in mid-2011.

The bones will be examined in laboratories at the University of South Florida and the University of North Texas, as part of a program funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and state of Florida.

After forensic investigators, using ground-piercing radar and old public records, detected 31 spots showing possible human remains, researchers planted crude white crosses on a nearby hillside to commemorate the unaccounted-for boys.

Some former residents of Dozier, now in their 60s and 70s, have told of brutal beatings and boys - mostly black juveniles - disappearing without explanation more than 50 years ago. Blood relatives of some of the boys have given DNA samples, to be matched against evidence taken from the skeletal remains.

Earlier on Saturday, Dr. Erin Kimmerle, a forensic anthropologist from USF, met with some family members and survivors.

"We're approaching it much like you would an archeological excavation," Kimmerle said. "It's all done carefully and by hand."

'NEVER HAD A CHANCE'

Tananarive Due, who came to the dig with some family members, said her great-uncle, Robert Stephens, died at the school in 1937.

"The story was ... he tried to run away at one point," she said. "The official cause of death was a stabbing by another inmate, that's what it was listed as. But with so many of these boys, who knows how they died? Their families never had a chance to say 'good-bye' to their loved ones."

Johnny Lee Gaddy, 67, said he was locked up from 1957 to 1961 for truancy. He said he was severely beaten, but in his teens became a good farm worker, hoping to get released.

Gaddy said he had heard of teens disappearing without explanation.

"I know some they said went home, but they hadn't been here long enough to go home," said Gaddy. "They said some others ran away or were transferred to other places. We never saw any bodies or funerals."

John Due, father of Tananarive, said descendants and civil-rights activists who pressed the state for disclosure of what happened to the young men ran into rigid resistance from authorities for decades.

"People didn't want to talk about it, and we found that particularly among black families," he said. "That's what racism does. It beats you down and you think you don't matter, so you won't speak up."

The forensic teams will work through Tuesday. Remains that can be identified will be re-interred at family plots and any unidentified remains will be numbered and buried - with records kept for later return to families, if any come forward.



headline: Obama will hold off on Syria strike until Congress has its say
byline: By Roberta Rampton and Jeff Mason
12:12am EDT

President Barack Obama on Saturday backed away from an imminent military strike against Syria to seek the approval of the U.S. Congress, in a decision that likely delays U.S. action for at least 10 days.

Obama, in a stern statement from the White House Rose Garden, said he had authorized the use of military force to punish Syria for a chemical weapons attack August 21 that U.S. officials say killed 1,429 people. Military assets to carry out a strike are in place and ready to move on his order, he said.

But in an acknowledgement of protests from U.S. lawmakers and concerns from war-weary Americans, Obama added an important caveat: he wants Congress to approve.

"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual," he said.

Congress is in recess and not scheduled to return to work until September 9. It is unclear which way any vote would go.

"Today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move as one nation," Obama said.

Obama's decision was a high-stakes gamble that he can gain approval from Congress for a limited strike against Syria to safeguard an international ban on chemical weapons usage, defend U.S. national security interests and protect regional allies like Turkey, Jordan and Israel.

"I have long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in our example as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people," Obama said.

His decision was also a significant shift away from what was perceived to be preparations for a speedy strike against Syrian targets. He had made clear he was prepared to act unilaterally after the British parliament refused to go along with American plans.

Protracted and expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have left Americans reluctant to get involved in Middle Eastern conflicts.

Most Americans do not want the United States to intervene in Syria. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken this week showed only 20 percent believe the United States should take action, but that was up from 9 percent last week.

DEBATE IN WASHINGTON

A debate has raged for days among members of the U.S. Congress over whether, or how quickly, Obama should take action.

House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top U.S. Republican, welcomed the move, which he said is a response to "serious, substantive questions" being raised about the ability of the president to launch a military move on his own.

"In consultation with the president, we expect the House to consider a measure the week of September 9. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people," he said.

Obama, who only on Friday had said nobody was more war-weary than he is, has nonetheless been appalled by searing video images of Syrians who fell under the chemical weapons onslaught.

In his Saturday speech, he left no doubt that he feels action must be taken and is confident that a strike would deter this kind of behavior and degrade Syria's ability to carry out similar attacks.

But his decision may well lead to criticism that he conceivably is stepping away again from a "red line" he established against Syrian use of chemical weapons.

"President Obama is abdicating his responsibility as commander in chief and undermining the authority of future presidents. The president does not need Congress to authorize a strike on Syria," said Republican Representative Peter King.

Obama's decision was announced after he met his national security team at the White House. Top aides were to brief senators later in the day and members of the House of Representatives are to receive a classified briefing from administration officials on Sunday.

The objective is to show the intelligence U.S. officials say is solid proof that the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad launched a large chemical weapons assault in Damascus suburbs that left among the dead 426 children.

Obama has broad legal powers to take military action, and he insisted he felt he had the authority to launch a strike on his own. Now, he has to launch a major effort to convince Congress.

"Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?" he said.



headline: Failure to thin brush may have worsened California wildfire
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
12:12am EDT

thinning projects approved by forestry officials but never funded might have slowed the progress of the massive Rim Fire in California, a wide range of critics said this weekend.

The massive blaze at the edge of Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountains has scorched an area larger than many U.S. cities - with some of that land in the very location pinpointed by the U.S. Forest service for eight projects aimed at clearing and burning brush and small trees that help fuel wildfire.

The projects, which were approved by the U.S. Forest Service but never funded by Congress, would have thinned the woods in about 25 square miles (65 square km) in the Groveland District of the Stanislaus National Forest, much of which was incinerated by the Rim Fire.

About 9,000 acres were suitable to be deliberately burned as fire prevention buffer zones in 2012, the Forest Service said in a document provided to Reuters.

But reductions in funding for fire prevention efforts by Congress in recent years coupled with stringent air quality standards that limit the timeframe for such burns have hampered efforts to carry them out on a larger scale.

Last year, the Forest Service had funding to burn 449 acres in the Groveland District but did not reach that target, said District Ranger Maggie Dowd.

The wildfire is the sixth-largest on record in California. It burned over 220,000 acres over the past two weeks while penetrating Yosemite National Park and threatening to befoul the Hetch Hetchy reservoir providing the lion's share of water to San Francisco.

"This is a colossal unfunded backlog of critically important fuel reduction work," said John Buckley, executive director of the Central Sierra Environmental Resource Center and a former Forest Service fire fighter. The projects "would have inarguably made the Rim Fire far easier to contain, far less expensive and possibly not even a major disaster."

Over the past several years, wildfires in the U.S. West have become increasingly frequent and at times deadly. Earlier this year, 19 firefighters were killed in a blaze in Arizona, and wildfires have raged in several states, including Nevada, Alaska and New Mexico.

MORE ACTIVE WILDFIRES

Federal fire figures show an average of 7.6 million acres (3.1 million hectares) charred per year between 2004 and 2012, up from 3.6 million acres (1.46 million hectares) annually in the preceding 20 years.

Part of the problem, experts and many fire officials say, is that funding has been low for the controlled burns and forest-thinning work that makes it harder for a wildfire to spread.

In recent years, Jarvis said, the trend has been to shift money from fire prevention to firefighting.

"We've got to invest up front in terms of controlling and managing these fires," said Jonathan Jarvis, director of the National Park Service from his smoke-filled post in Yosemite National Park. "Just waiting for the big fire and then throwing everything you've got at it makes no sense."

The massive blazes are fueled by high temperatures, said U.S. Forest Service geographer Carl Skinner.

Mike Albrecht, co-owner of the logging company Sierra Resource Management, which operates on public land in the Sierra Nevada mountains said that the backlogged projects would likely have helped limit the Rim Fire.

The "one-two punch" of thinning the forest through logging and prescribed burns is essential for stemming the tide of catastrophic wildfires across the American West, he said.

Craig Thomas, conservation director for the environmental coalition group Sierra Forest Legacy, said such a course would help reduce the intensity of wildfires enough to spare the largest trees, while clearing space and providing nutrients for grasses and wildflowers.

In addition to perennial funding shortfalls for prevention efforts, Thomas faults federal and state air quality regimes that limit the timeframe for prescribed burns by counting the smoke they generate along with industrial and auto emissions - while not counting the smoke from an actual wildfire.

There is also skepticism over the relative importance of planned burning among some lawmakers, including Congressman Tom McClintock, a third-term conservative Republican in whose district the Rim Fire has burned.

More dire than a backlog of Forest Service controlled burns, McClintock says, is the precipitous, 25-year decline in logging of bigger, money-making trees on public lands.

"If we were harvesting the same amount of timber we once did, we'd have fewer fires but also a revenue stream for the treatment of many thousands of acres (hectares) that we're not treating today," he said.

Dowd, the Forest Service Ranger, said that with containment lines built around less than half of the still-burning Rim Fire, it is too early to know how much the prevention projects might have helped.

But she said that the several dozen acres of prescribed burns carried out in her district over the past two years, are insufficient.

"It's not enough," Dowd said.

pound (41.9 kg) specimen named "Bob" to officials at the state fair.

Keevan Dinkel of Wasilla, Alaska, produced this year's winning entry, which was carried in by several Boy Scouts, in the Alaska State Fair's Giant Cabbage Weigh-Off on Friday night.

His giant cabbage, which rose to about thigh height on a typical adult, and those of other contestants were weighed at the fairgrounds in Palmer, in a contest watched by hundreds of onlookers, attended by green-clad women dressed as "cabbage fairies" and monitored by a representative of the state Division of Weights and Measures.

Produce can grow to enormous sizes under Alaska's summer midnight sun. Growing big cabbages is a tradition in this part of the state, just north of Anchorage, which is considered Alaska's main farm belt.

This year was the first time in the contest's 18 years that a child has won the weigh-off, according to state fair officials. The fair offers a junior competition for growers 12 and younger, but Keevan's entry was put into the adult open category because of its size.

Keevan, whose family operates a local farm, took home $2,000 for his prize-winner.

Keevan's "Bob" fell short of the world-record 138.3-pound (62.7-kg) cabbage, called the "Palmer Pachyderm," grown last year by Palmer greenhouse owner Scott Robb.

While the unusually hot and sunny summer was good for many crops, that was not the case for the traditional green cabbages, said growers attending Friday's fair weigh-in.

"Cabbages are a cold crop. They like their roots warm and their heads cool," said Mardie Robb, Scott Robb's wife.

Alaska's giant vegetables also face hazards, including marauding moose that are fond of poaching would-be winners while they are growing in gardens, and flaws that might develop during growing can knock them out of contention.

This year, a potential state-champion pumpkin, a 1,289-pound (584.6 kg) specimen named "Time Bandit" and grown by J.D. Megchelsen of Nikiski, was disqualified because of a hole, violating rules calling for vegetables to be structurally intact. Absent the hole, it would have just beaten the Alaska pumpkin record of 1,287 pounds (583.8 kg) that Megchelsen set in 2011. Instead, this year's blue ribbon went to a 1,182-pound (536.1 kg) pumpkin named "Eva" that was grown in Anchorage.

Davidson Co, but few traveled as far as Chai Chua.

The 46-year-old business owner bid farewell to his wife and three children in Brunei about a week ago and set off with seven of his closest friends. They flew to Los Angeles, then hopped on rented Harley-Davidson motorcycles and headed to the Midwestern state.

"My wife knows I am crazy about this," said Chua, after arriving at the site of the party, where he and his friends joined the crowds marking the motorcycle maker's anniversary over the Labor Day weekend.

"We have seen the prairies, the mountains, Mount Rushmore and now the Mecca for riders," Chua said, shouting over blues music outside of the Harley-Davidson Museum where revelers kicked off the celebration with a bike rally on Thursday.

Nearby, a long procession of the motorcycles, nicknamed "hogs," rumbled onto the museum campus, where riders parked their bikes in tight rows creating a glistening sea of shiny steel.

Riders donned black leather, as well as an assortment of denim, bandanas and Harley-Davidson orange, as they snapped photos, drank beer and marveled at the spectacle.

"It's exciting ... . (There's) a lot of personal satisfaction in doing it," said Fernando Dorantes, 52, an engineer from Toluca, Mexico, where he and seven of his friends began their five-day, 2,600-mile (4,200-km) journey to Milwaukee.

The party spread across several sites in the city, including the SummerFest grounds where bands including ZZ Top, Blue Oyster Cult and the Doobie Brothers performed.

"It doesn't matter what you are or what you look like. As long as you ride, it's a brotherhood," said Bobby Hite, 40, of Culver, Indiana, after getting a 110th anniversary tattoo on his left bicep. "You got the cackle, the rumble between your legs."

Harley-Davidson has long relied on a white, male and middle-aged consumer base, an approach reflected in the makeup of the Milwaukee crowd.

But in recent years, it has begun to try to design motorcycles that appeal to younger riders, women and minorities.

The celebration focused on the evolution of the bike during the past century, with guests going on tours of the Harley plant, a few miles from where William Harley and Arthur Davidson began making them in a shed in 1903.

"This is where it all began. Harley Davidson is my life. Besides my kids, it is my life," said Terry Martin, 59, of Boston, as he sat on his motorcycle next to a replica of the shed at the company's headquarters.

The celebration comes weeks after rival Polaris Industries relaunched the Indian motorcycle, a storied U.S. brand two years older than Harley-Davidson, at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, hallowed ground for legions of Harley-Davidson enthusiasts who flock to South Dakota each year.

But on this weekend in Milwaukee, it is all about the hog and its colorful array of devoted riders who crave the open road.

"It's freedom," said Drew Canon, a 45-year-old Texan with a short gray beard and tattooed arms. "You feel all of your senses. You smell it all, you hear it all."

sex marriage in a posting on Facebook.

Liz Cheney, who is seeking a Senate seat in Wyoming, said on Friday that she was "not pro-gay marriage."

"For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage," Mary Cheney wrote on Facebook, according to the New York Times.

"Freedom means freedom for everyone," she wrote, repeating a phrase once used by her father when he was asked about gay marriage. "That means all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other."

Both Mary Cheney and Liz Cheney could not be reached on Sunday for comment.

Liz Cheney on Friday clarified her position on same-sex marriage in response to what she said was a "dishonest push poll" in which callers were asked whether they were aware that she supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage.

"I am strongly pro-life and I am not pro-gay marriage," Liz Cheney said in her statement on Friday. "I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves."

Mary Cheney responded by saying that the issue was "not something to be decided by a show of hands."

Dick Cheney, who served as vice president under President George W. Bush, has long indicated he was supportive of gay marriage, saying that "people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into." But he has said states should regulate the matter, not the federal government.

Same-sex marriage is a divisive issue for Republicans. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in the spring found that a slim majority of Republican or Republican-leaning independents under age 50 supported gay marriage. In July, the Republican National Committee's chairman, Reince Priebus, reiterated the party's stand that marriage was between one man and one woman.



headline: For Wyoming town of one, rebirth as a hub for Vietnamese coffee
byline: By Laura Zuckerman
12:12am EDT

open this week as a hub for the sale of coffee distributed by its new Vietnamese owner.

In an on-site and Internet auction in April 2012, Nguyen Dinh Pham, 38, offered a winning bid of $900,000 for the town, billed by auction organizers as the nation's smallest, at just over 10 acres.

The high-elevation hamlet - 8,000 feet above sea level on Interstate 80 in southeastern Wyoming - came complete with a convenience store, gas station and modular home, as well as its own ZIP code.

It sprang to life in the 1860s as a military fort to guard the building of the transcontinental railroad and sported a population of as much as 2,000 in the decades that followed.

Buford - recognized as a town by the U.S. Postal Service and Wyoming's Department of Transportation - was sought by bidders from 46 countries during the auction, streamed live over the Internet.

Pham, an importer from Ho Chi Minh City, bought Buford from its single resident, Don Sammons, to fulfill a dream of land ownership and business independence, and his trip to attend the auction in person was his first to the United States

"I thought Buford was very amazing and very exciting," Pham said. "After I purchased it, I kept thinking about what to do with the town."

This past March, Pham and an associate, Tuan Do, created a company, PhinDeli Corp, to produce and sell Vietnamese coffee and to establish the brand in Buford.

PhinDeli roughly translates as "delicious filter coffee," WyomingNews.com reported on Sunday, citing a U.S. marketing representative retained by Pham. In Vietnam, coffee is typically brewed using a metal filter.

SINGLE RESIDENT

The coffee will be shipped from Vietnam to Buford, where it will be available to buy but also distributed to warehouses in the United States and sold through Amazon.com, Pham and Do said.

Pham has hired Sammons, a 63-year-old Vietnam War veteran, to oversee the operation from his nearby base in Loveland, Colorado, and has named him co-mayor.

For Sammons, the re-opening ceremony, planned for Tuesday in Buford, is a reassuring sign a town he ran for more than two decades will continue on.

"The world came to Buford," he said of international tourists who stopped for gas and snacks at the town, on I-80, a 2,900-mile highway between New York City and San Francisco. "Now, Buford will go to the world."

Sammons and his wife moved from Los Angeles to a ranch near Buford in 1980 seeking a rural lifestyle. The couple arrived in the conservative ranching community in a lipstick red Lincoln Continental that was ill-suited to the area's deep snows and high winds, and people in the area believed the transplants would soon move out.

"They gave us six months," Sammons said.

Sammons, after selling Buford last year, thought he had said his last goodbye to the place, where his wife died in 1986. But when Pham invited him earlier this year to take part in the venture, he signed on.

Betty Schroll, 93, who splits her time between Cheyenne, the state capital, and a cabin near Buford and whose ancestors settled the area, said she can remember her father taking her to Buford in the family's 1920 Dodge.

"I used to go there for an ice cream cone; now I'll go for coffee," she said.



headline: California wildfire threatening Yosemite is now size of Dallas
byline: By Jonathan Allen
12:12am EDT

A massive wildfire that has charred the northwestern edge of California's Yosemite National Park is heading towards two groves of the park's famed sequoia trees, National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis said as firefighters battled the blaze on Saturday.

The so-called Rim Fire, which now has an overall footprint that exceeds the area of Dallas, has burned about six percent of Yosemite's wilder backcountry but the vast majority of the park was still unaffected, Jarvis said.

The sequoias are expected to survive if the fire spreads through the groves of the towering redwoods that are among the park's most famous features, Jarvis said in a telephone interview.

"This is not a catastrophe for Yosemite National Park," he said in a telephone interview after surveying the affected areas. "These trees are very old and it's not the first fire they've ever seen."

Firefighters have been carrying out controlled burnings at night around the groves to clear away debris from the forest floor that could otherwise fuel a fire to such an intensity that it dangerously licks at the trees' crowns.

Lower-intensity fires, on the other hand, play a vital role in the reproductive cycle of the tough-barked sequoia, many of which bear the scars of past wildfires, by releasing the seeds from their cones and clearing the soil in which they germinate.

The so-called Rim Fire has continued to spread, having now consumed nearly 220,000 acres by Saturday, according to a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. Most of the damage is in the Stanislaus National Forest that spreads out from Yosemite's western edge.

Firefighters have contained about a third of that area.

"We're very, very cautious about the potential today," Timothy Evans, the spokesman, said. "Yesterday was very hot, there was some wind, and the same was somewhat predicted for today."

The blaze is now approximately tied with the Matilija wildfire in Ventura County of 1932 as the fourth-largest California wildfire on record.

Jarvis estimated that firefighting efforts had so far cost state and federal agencies about $54 million. He criticized a decline in federal funding for fire-prevention work, including the practice of controlled fires that make the chance of a wildfire of this intensity less likely.

Nearly 5,000 people are working to put out the fire, including firefighters from agencies across California and nearly 700 specially trained California prison inmates.

Tourism-dependent businesses around the park have bemoaned a slump in visitors at the peak of the late-summer tourist season. Jarvis said there was no need to for visitors to stay away.

"Yosemite Valley is open to the public and is gorgeous," he said, referring to one of the park's most scenic and visited areas, adding that it is more than 20 miles from the edge of the fire.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

has more cause to worry.

Syrians living in the United States are deeply divided about what should be done - with some calling for a swift bombing campaign to unseat President Bashar al-Assad, while others blame the crisis on rebel groups. Yet both camps are united in fearing that U.S. strikes will only mean more bloodshed back home.

The 2-1/2 year conflict has touched the lives of many ex-patriate Syrians, as stories unfold of family members and friends who have been killed or beaten - either by forces loyal to the Syrian regime or by the opposition.

In the town of Paterson, New Jersey, about 20 miles south of New York City, is a section called "Little Syria," where a sizable Syrian community lives and works. Restaurants and shops along Main Street keep their television sets tuned to news channels showing the latest developments in the civil war, while friends are quick to pass along Internet videos showing destruction from the latest attacks.

"I wanted the USA to step in from the beginning to defeat Assad," said Ahmed Jay, 22, whose family opened Paterson's Aleppo Restaurant after moving to the United States in 2004. "I have ten friends who have died; two cousins, one aunt, one uncle. We've gotten used to crying."

Others said they felt let down - by both the Obama administration and the international community. Britain's parliament earlier this week voted against military action in Syria.

"This is the third year Assad has been killing people," said Mohamad Rahmoun, 55. "Why do we have to suffer like this? I call the White House every day, every day. I tell them we need help."

"We want Obama to bomb the regime," he said. "But we don't want civilians killed."

On Friday, Obama said he was considering a "limited, narrow" military action to punish Assad for a poison gas attack outside Damascus that U.S. intelligence said killed 1,429 people.

On Saturday, White House officials were to make their case to the full Senate.

They could face a tough audience, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll showing that 53 percent of Americans, weary after a decade of foreign wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, believe the United States should stay out of Syria.

"A lot of people think something should be done, but nobody wants to do it," Obama said.

'I AM WORRIED'

The question is a particularly tough one for Syrians with family members back home. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 159,000 people of Syrian ancestry live in the United States, with the largest concentration in the northeast, according to data from 2009.

Mossab Awad, a 27-year-old medical student in Massachusetts, said he thought Washington had little choice but to strike, but worried about the safety of his mother, father and brother.

"How do we know the missiles won't kill innocent people, and how do we know it won't just cause Assad to be even more brutal?" Awad said. "He can set the region in flames."

Adding to Awad's anxiety is the fact that he has not heard from his family in his government-controlled hometown of Idlib for days.

"When I last talked to them, they were fine. But the phones have stopped working and I have heard the rebels are trying to take Idlib," he said. "I am worried."

Syrians in America who support the Assad regime, or simply distrust the rebel groups, warn that U.S. military intervention could only lead to further destabilization in the region.

'UNNECESSARY WAR'

Some blame the opposition for many of the atrocities, including the August 21 poison gas attack, and fear the country could follow down the path of Iraq, which has been plagued by sectarian violence since the end of the U.S.-led invasion.

Syrians and anti-war activists calling for "Hands Off Syria," have been staging daily protests in Manhattan.

The rebels "are driving America and the rest of the world into another unnecessary war in a fabricated, orchestrated scenario of having chemical weapons. Just like what happened in Iraq," said Tom Sarkin, 37, who was 17 when he immigrated to the United States from Aleppo.

Others said the Assad government was defending the Syrian people from an influx of foreign fighters and their Islamist influence.

"These (rebel) fighters aren't from Syria, they are called Islamic Brotherhood and they are from all over ... Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya ... from all over the world," said Farah Slebi, 22, who moved to Brooklyn, New York, five years ago to attend school.

She called Assad "a good man."

"He brought technology to Syria. He made online studying, just like in the U.S.," Slebi said. "We didn't ask for this freedom from Assad. We were free."

During a protest in Times Square on Thursday, Slebi got in a heated argument with someone from a counter-demonstration calling for regime change in Syria.

"We used to be friends," she said. But no longer: "He's against the government."

century ago are believed to have been secretly buried.

"We have found evidence of burial hardware - hinges on coffins," said Dr. Christian Wells, an anthropologist from the University of South Florida, in a briefing about a mile from the closed excavation site near the former Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys.

"There appear to be a few pieces associated with burial shrouds, and there are pins consistent with the 1920s and 1930s, - based on the style of the pins - and they appear to be brass," he said.

Some "large bone fragments" were found on the first day of digging, Wells said. They were human bones, he added, but it was impossible to know if they came from any of the teenaged boys who were housed at Dozier during its infamous 111-year existence. The school was closed in mid-2011.

The bones will be examined in laboratories at the University of Southern Florida and the University of North Texas, as part of a program funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and state of Florida.

After forensic investigators, using ground-piercing radar and old public records, detected 31 spots showing possible human remains, researchers planted crude white crosses on a nearby hillside to commemorate the unaccounted-for boys.

Some former residents of Dozier, now in their 60s and 70s, have told of brutal beatings and boys - mostly black juveniles - disappearing without explanation more than 50 years ago. Blood relatives of some of the boys have given DNA samples, to be matched against evidence taken from the skeletal remains.

Earlier on Saturday, Dr. Erin Kimmerly, a forensic anthropologist from USF, met with some family members and survivors.

"We're approaching it much like you would an archeological excavation," Kimmerle said. "It's all done carefully and by hand."

'NEVER HAD A CHANCE'

Tananarive Due, who came to the dig with some family members, said her great-uncle, Robert Stephens, died at the school in 1937.

"The story was ... he tried to run away at one point," she said. "The official cause of death was a stabbing by another inmate, that's what it was listed as. But with so many of these boys, who knows how they died? Their families never had a chance to say 'good-bye' to their loved ones."

Johnny Lee Gaddy, 67, said he was locked up from 1957 to 1961 for truancy. He said he was severely beaten, but in his teens became a good farm worker, hoping to get released.

Gaddy said he had heard of teens disappearing without explanation.

"I know some they said went home, but they hadn't been here long enough to go home," said Gaddy. "They said some others ran away or were transferred to other places. We never saw any bodies or funerals."

John Due, father of Tananarive, said descendants and civil-rights activists who pressed the state for disclosure of what happened to the young men ran into rigid resistance from authorities for decades.

"People didn't want to talk about it, and we found that particularly among black families," he said. "That's what racism does. It beats you down and you think you don't matter, so you won't speak up."

The forensic teams will work through Tuesday. Remains that can be identified will be re-interred at family plots and any unidentified remains will be numbered and buried - with records kept for later return to families, if any come forward.

headline: Wedding bells a casualty of massive Yosemite blaze
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
12:12am EDT

Add fairy tale weddings to the list of casualties from the mammoth wildfire blazing in and around Yosemite National Park.

Hawaii couple Katie Sprouse, 33, and Jamil Folio, 36, spent a year making plans to exchange vows near the scenic park, where they were set to tie the knot before 70 relatives and friends on Saturday night - until the blaze started burning.

The so-called Rim Fire left the pair, who live in Maui, and two other couples with wedding dates at the evacuated Evergreen Lodge scrambling to make other arrangements, according to the Hawaii couple and lodge co-owner Lee Zimmerman.

"I had everything planned six months ago," Sprouse, an archeologist, told Reuters. "A week ago Friday, as I was packing to leave, the lodge called me to say it wasn't going to happen."

Fallout from the wildfire, the fifth largest on record in California after charring an area the size of Kansas City, Missouri, also forced the cancellation of the Strawberry Music Festival, a biannual bluegrass jamboree where Sprouse and Folio met two years ago.

On this holiday weekend, one of Yosemite's busiest periods, thousands of tourists have had to revise their travel plans after the fire crossed into the park and forced road closures at the premier tourist destination.

The fire has ravaged already struggling area businesses.

Proprietors had been counting on a healthy summer season to carry them through the slow winter months, particularly after an outbreak of the potentially deadly rodent-borne hantavirus scared off tourists last year.

Park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said the inferno had burned 6 percent of the landmark's 748,000 acres and forced the closure of 4 of 13 campgrounds.

Some 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, with most going during the peak months of June through August. Some 620,000 normally visit the park in August alone, but due to the fire, attendance has dropped.

"It's not super substantial," Cobb said of the drop, "but it is noticeable."

The park's most popular areas, including Yosemite Valley with the iconic Half Dome and El Capitan rock formations, remain open, Cobb said.

BUSINESSES STRUGGLING

Proprietors who depend on tourism near parts of the park that have been closed off said they were struggling to stay alive.

Chris Loh, 38, who owns the Iron Door Saloon in Groveland, estimated his business had fallen 98 percent, forcing him to lay off 45 employees, most of his workforce.

"Last summer was the hantavirus; the summer before was a control fire that got out of control," he said. "To have multiple years of having our season shut down early is just devastating."

James Nagle, president of the Yosemite Highway 120 Chamber of Commerce, estimated that tourism to the area had dropped by 25 percent. "A lot of the impacted businesses were counting on Labor Day weekend to get them through the winter," he said.

The blaze burned two of five cabins that Eliote Durham manages on the Tuolumne River in the Stanislaus National Forest. It also destroyed a well house, eliminating the water source for the Spinning Wheel Ranch where the vacation rentals are located, she said.

Durham was briefly allowed to go to the ranch, and she took photographs of potholes left when trees burned like candles into the roots.

"We're probably closed for the year," she said. "It looks like a moonscape."

The worst part for recovering businesses, Nagle said, is that when tourists do return, they will see a scorched landscape. "It's just ugly," he said.

Newlyweds Sprouse and Folio will marry in the Butterfly Creek Winery on Saturday in Mariposa, about 30 miles south of their original wedding site, and plan to return next year to the Strawberry Music Festival, where they got engaged last year. They had planned to attend the event this year as part of their wedding celebration.

When the fire forced Camp Mather, the festival's site, to be evacuated, organizers had to postpone the 32nd annual Labor Day bluegrass festival that draws about 5,000 guests.

"I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend," Sprouse posted on a festival Facebook page, "and we will see you all next year at our one-year anniversary!"

conferencing system, a practice used to serve women in rural areas without doctors.

The board voted 8-2 to ban the practice, with most members arguing the best standard of care for a woman seeking an abortion is to have a doctor perform a physical exam and talk face-to-face with the patient.

Currently, women in remote parts of the state who live far from abortion providers can speak with a physician through Internet video and then take the medication to induce an early-term abortion.

Among those voting to ban telemedicine for abortions was Monsignor Frank Bognanno, pastor of Christ the King Catholic Parish in Des Moines and appointed to the board by Republican Governor Terry Branstad, an abortion foe.

"This is a big deal ... This isn't like taking an aspirin," Bognanno said.

Ann Gales, a lawyer and board member, voted against the ban, arguing for more examination of the issue and raising concern that the vote was being rushed.

"If this is the right rule, it will still be the right rule after we engage in a more thorough discussion," Gales said.

State laws requiring doctors to be present when abortion-inducing drugs are administered are becoming increasingly common, particularly in states run by Republican governors or Republican controlled legislatures. Eleven states have them, said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group.

Abortion rights advocates say the laws are unfair to rural residents who do not have access to doctors and depend on telemedicine to get abortions, Nash said.

Greg Hoversten, D.O., the Iowa medical board's chairman, voted for the ban.

"How can any of us possibly find that a medical abortion performed over the Internet is as safe as one provided by a physician in person, at the bedside?" Hoversten asked.

The ban on so-called "tele-med" abortions was set to take effect on November 6.

A lawyer for Planned Parenthood told reporters after the vote that, "all options are on the table," including possible legal action to prevent the rule from taking effect.



headline: Top Florida health insurer touts Obamacare pain relief
byline: By Tom Brown
12:12am EDT

Florida's leading health insurer is reaching out to hundreds of thousands of state residents, touting temporary relief from what it describes as an imminent spike in premium rates due to President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law.

"When the new healthcare law takes effect, you may be surprised how much more you could pay for health insurance," says an advisory to consumers from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, also known as Florida Blue.

"Find out how much you'll save if you buy now," adds the advisory, which has been mailed over the past month to homes of existing policyholders and potential new clients.

"Let us help you get the best deal on health insurance right now," the notice says. "We can even tell you if you can get help paying for coverage from the government."

Under Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, millions of uninsured Americans will be able to buy government-subsidized health coverage on new online state insurance exchanges beginning on October 1. The cost of the new plans, which require insurers to provide more benefits to consumers and bar the exclusion of people with prior illnesses, is a key factor to making the enrollment effort a success.

However, the law also allows consumers to select from existing individual insurance policies now and extend them into 2014. While these existing policies may be cheaper in some states than those under the Obamacare reform plan, many may not contain the same comprehensive benefits.

Florida Blue's notice marks one of the more aggressive efforts by an insurer to tap into fears of "sticker shock" for the newer Obamacare plans. Republican-led Florida refused to set up its own insurance exchange, leaving the job to the federal government.

The enrollment stakes are big in the Sunshine State, where the U.S. Census Bureau says there are about 3.8 million people without health insurance. About a quarter of Florida's population is uninsured, giving it the third-highest rate in the country.

Florida's insurance regulators have said the cost of new insurance plans may rise 30 to 40 percent when compared with a fictional 2013 plan modeled to include the same benefits. But rates in the state are still being finalized between insurers and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Florida estimates don't include substantial subsidies that a majority of uninsured people may qualify for.

Florida Blue said the advisory is part of a direct mail advertising campaign aimed at drumming up new business for the Jacksonville, Florida-based giant, which reported $8.9 billion in revenues last year and covers more than 4.3 million people in its primary health business in the state.

The company, a leading contributor to the political action committee of Florida's Republican Governor Rick Scott, is one of nine insurers that have applied to sell non-group policies on the state's new marketplace and the only one that promises to cover every county in Florida.

Craig Thomas, the executive responsible for marketing and strategy at Florida Blue, said the consumer advisory - unlike anything seen from other health insurance companies in Florida - was part of what he termed "an appropriate marketing program."

It primarily targets many people purchasing coverage in Florida's individual market today who will be ineligible for premium subsidies under Obamacare, Thomas said.

Many of those same consumers will be hit with higher rates because of benefit changes and other factors tied to next year's full implementation of the law, he said.

"Their rates are generally going to go up," said Thomas. "New expenses are going to be reflected in next year's premiums."

HURTING ENROLLMENT

Federal and consumer groups dispute the state's projections. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on a recent Florida visit that competition for customers should help keep premiums in check.

An HHS spokeswoman declined to comment on the Florida Blue campaign, which comes against the backdrop of a full-court press by Scott and other Republican leaders in the state to undermine Obamacare.

But Ron Pollack, who heads Families USA, the national healthcare consumer advocacy group, strongly criticized the campaign and said it could hurt enrollment in Florida for coverage under the president's reform plan.

"This letter from an insurer that has tried to appear helpful to consumers is outrageous, misleading and for many, totally erroneous," Pollack told Reuters.

"People who get suckered into this appeal may very well lose many thousands of dollars in premium subsidies that become available soon if they enroll starting on October 1 in health coverage through the Affordable Care Act," he said.

Republican opponents of the reform law were the driving force behind Florida Senate Bill 1842. Signed into law by Governor Scott in May, the legislation prohibits Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation from providing any real protection for consumers from unreasonably high health insurance rates.

The federal government says it lacks the legal authority to regulate insurance premiums in individual states, though it is trying to persuade insurers to alter higher-priced plans when it can.

Sebelius, who has said she was "baffled" by Florida's move, commented earlier this month that she knew of no other state that had chosen to eliminate its own regulatory oversight, leaving consumers at the mercy of health insurance companies.

"It's really unconscionable that the Florida legislature and Governor Scott would take what is in essence the insurance cop, regulating insurance companies, off the playing field, take that cop off the beat ... It just doesn't make sense for families or small businesses. They're supposed to be on our side," said Tampa's U.S. Representative Kathy Castor.

Castor, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and seven other Florida Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to Sebelius decrying their state's deregulation of health insurers as "a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums more expensive on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace."

The same law that curtails Florida's rate-setting authority requires insurers to issue notices to consumers, blaming hikes in premiums on "the impact of federal healthcare reform."

A copy of one such notice, which all health insurance companies operating in the state will be required to use, was made available to Reuters by the insurance commissioner's office.

Thomas, who spoke in a telephone interview with Reuters from Jacksonville, said many Florida consumers could benefit financially from buying policies now, even though the plans would expire under Obamacare with no chance of renewal.

"The benefits and rates they buy now would not be changed until the product anniversary date gets here next summer," Thomas said. It will carry them with their current program well into next year," he added.

He and other company officials declined to comment on how Florida Blue's premiums in 2014 would compare to existing rates.

profile rulings on the highly divisive issue.

A court spokesman said on Friday that Ginsburg would be officiating at the ceremony on Saturday at the Kennedy Center. Ginsburg is the first justice to preside over a wedding ceremony involving a same-sex couple.

As reported by the Washington Post, Ginsburg will preside over the wedding of Michael Kaiser, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, and John Roberts, an economist.

In June, the court struck down a federal law that denied federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples and paved the way for gay marriage in California by letting stand a ruling that struck down a state law that restricted marriage to opposite-sex couples.

Gay marriage is legal in Washington, D.C., and 13 U.S. states.

In an interview with Reuters in July, Ginsburg said she was pleased with the court's decisions on the issue. Of the increasing public acceptance of gay marriage, she said, "I think the country is doing remarkably well. I don't think anyone could have predicted this."

headline: San Diego mayor accused of sexual harassment leaves office quietly
byline: By Marty Graham
12:12am EDT

Bob Filner's term as San Diego mayor came to a quiet end on Friday as the veteran politician who resigned in the face of a sexual harassment lawsuit stayed out of the public eye on his last day in office.

Filner, a former Democratic congressman elected to lead California's second-largest city last year, announced his resignation last week as part of a settlement with the city over how to handle a lawsuit filed by his former press secretary.

The press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, is among 18 women who have accused the 70-year-old politician of making unwanted sexual advances toward them, but is so far the only one to sue him.

Parks department employee Stacy McKenzie filed a $500,000 battery and sexual assault claim against the city in what her attorney has said was a precursor to a lawsuit.

As part of the deal in which Filner agreed to resign, the city will join in his legal defense, according to an outline from the city attorney's office, which will be responsible for representing the mayor.

Filner had said that he would work until 5 p.m. on Friday, but it was unclear if he made an appearance at his office during the day. The city has scheduled a special election for November 19 to replace him, at a cost of between $5.9 million and $6.2 million.

A woman answering the phone in Filner's office at about noon declined to say if he was at work, and his spokeswoman did not return calls seeking comment. People who work in the lobby of the building said he had not been seen all week.

Todd Gloria, president of the city council who will act as interim mayor, told reporters that he would be moving into the office shortly.

"We're going to be moving forward and doing it aggressively because we're having to make up for lost time," Gloria told the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper. "We've been moving backward and that ends today."

Meanwhile, Gloria Allred, the Los Angeles attorney who represents Jackson and several other women making accusations against Filner, held a news conference to celebrate his departure.

"At 5 p.m. today, San Diego will finally be free of Bob Filner and all the shame that he has brought to the city of San Diego," Allred said.

In announcing his resignation, an emotional Filner apologized to San Diego residents but said no sexual harassment allegations had been proven against him.

"In a lynch mob mentality, rumors become allegations, allegations become facts, facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall," he said.

Nearly every elected official in San Diego from both parties had urged him to step down, including all nine members of city council.

headline: Sports drink helps California inmates on hunger strike stave off starvation
byline: By Sharon Bernstein
12:12am EDT

Inmates on a hunger strike to protest California's solitary confinement policies are staving off starvation by drinking Gatorade, but medical troubles are setting in nonetheless, a spokeswoman for the office in charge of prisoner healthcare said on Friday.

Of 123 inmates who are refusing food, 15 have lost potentially dangerous amounts of weight, and most report feeling weak and cold, said Liz Gransee, a spokeswoman for the official who oversees healthcare in the 34-prison system.

"Some of them aren't handling this as well as others," Gransee said. "Some of them have had IV fluids multiple times."

The inmates are participating in the largest and longest hunger strike in recent memory in California over the state's policy of keeping prisoners in near-isolation for years on end. Many are put in solitary confinement because prison officials believe they have gang affiliations.

As of Friday, 41 prisoners have refused food continuously since the hunger strike began on July 8, according to the state. Others have stopped at times and then begun again.

The hunger strike is the latest in a string of difficulties plaguing the California corrections system, which is under court orders to reduce crowding this year. Medical care in the system is under the control of a federally appointed receiver.

A panel of federal judges has threatened to hold Governor Jerry Brown in contempt if he does not act quickly, even if that means releasing thousands of inmates early. Brown wants to spend $315 million next year to lease space in private prisons, county jails and out-of-state lockups.

Under the supervision of the medical receiver, J. Clark Kelso, hunger strikers are monitored daily and examined by prison doctors at least weekly, Gransee said.

Deborah Hoffman, a spokeswoman for the state, said the health and safety of inmates was a priority, and that officials were working closely with the receiver's office to make sure participants receive adequate medical care.

She blamed the strike on gang leaders who she said were coercing other prisoners to participate in the strike. The state changed some of its guidelines for keeping prisoners in isolated conditions after a hunger strike in 2011, but has not budged any further in response to the current action.

VITAMINS AND GATORADE

The California inmates on hunger strike are taking vitamins and the electrolyte-replenishing sports drink Gatorade, which provides up to 625 calories per day and has helped slow the progress of starvation-related illnesses among participants, Gransee said.

A typical 30-year-old man needs between 2400 and 2600 calories per day, depending on his size and activity level. All of the hunger strikers are men.

Gransee said none have lost consciousness or been deemed to be near death so far. Last week, officials won permission from a federal court to force-feed some gravely ill inmates, even if they had signed orders asking not to be resuscitated. So far, however, that power has not been invoked.

Elena Kret-Sudjian, medical director of clinical nutrition at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center, said the inmates could still succumb to starvation because the beverages do not contain protein.

"When the body burns fat it always also burns the muscle and it's very dangerous ," Kret-Sudjian said. "When humans lose 40 percent of muscle they will die."

The state has not released figures on how much muscle inmates have lost. Gransee said 13 inmates have lost more than 10 percent of their body weight, and two have lost more than 15 percent of body weight, putting them into a higher risk category.

People can develop long-term medical problems from fasting for as little as one week, Kret-Sudjian said. By the seventh week, starvation symptoms are likely to be advanced. Long-term conditions can include heart disease and neurological problems.

"People may feel initially very irritable, even depressed," she said. "They may have reduced body temperature, be extremely sensitive to cold, or have chronic diarrhea, decreased sex drive and other complications."

The current hunger strike marks the second time in two years that prisoners have refused food over the state's solitary confinement practices. More than 4,000 prisoners are segregated from other inmates, most of them in so-called security housing units where they live in various degrees of isolation.

This strike, however, has gone on more than twice as long as the 2011 action and attracted more prisoners - 30,000 - at its peak.

Hundreds have been treated in prison clinics, hospitals and other facilities since the hunger strike began, Gransee said. Their symptoms have included dehydration, cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness and lightheadedness.



headline: Judge plans to appoint monitor for controversial Arizona sheriff
byline: By David Schwartz
12:12am EDT

A federal judge plans to appoint a monitor to watch over the operations of hardline Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose office had been found by the judge to have racially profiled Latino drivers during the lawman's crackdown on illegal immigration.

U.S. District Judge Murray Snow said in a court hearing on Friday that the Maricopa County lawman, who styles himself as "America's toughest sheriff," needed an independent check on his actions to prevent such profiling from continuing in the future.

"I intend to approve a monitor," Snow said of his plans, despite stiff opposition from the six-term sheriff of Arizona's most populous county. A ruling outlining changes to be made at the sheriff's office could come as early as mid-September.

Arpaio, 81, has attracted national attention with his get-tough stance on illegal immigration in Arizona, which borders Mexico. He faces an investigation and lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department, which accuses him of civil rights abuses.

The same judge handed down a decision in May ordering the sheriff to stop using race as a factor in law enforcement decisions, in response to a class-action lawsuit that tested whether police could target illegal immigrants without racially profiling U.S. citizens and legal residents of Hispanic origin.

The judge, who ruled Arpaio had violated the constitutional rights of Latino drivers, had ordered lawyers for the sides to try to agree to steps to correct the abuse, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful.

Arpaio attorney Tim Casey told the court on Friday that he was concerned about a court-appointed monitor usurping the sheriff's power.

"Who will resolve the disputes with him?" Casey asked the judge during a four-hour hearing. The judge responded, "I will resolve the disputes."

Casey said previously that Arpaio had already taken strong steps to correct past problems, including stopping controversial saturation sweeps that targeted and detained immigrants. Those operations stopped in October 2011.

Cecillia Wang, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project, which represents the plaintiffs in the case, said the sheriff's continued opposition to a monitor was troubling.

"There really needs to be a way to make sure he (Arpaio) is not violating the Constitution," Wang said.

Arizona has been at the heart of a bitter national debate over immigration since Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed a 2010 crackdown on illegal immigration that was subsequently challenged by the federal government.

The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed to stand a part of the law that permits police to question people they stop about their immigration status.



headline: Yosemite wildfire still raging, keeps tourists away
byline: By Laila Kearney
12:12am EDT

Fire crews battling to outflank a monster wildfire inside Yosemite National Park made headway on Friday in confining flames to wilderness areas but were powerless to salvage the region's sputtering tourist economy at the end of its peak summer tourist season.

By morning, the tally of charred landscape from the so-called Rim Fire surpassed 200,000 acres, or nearly 315 square miles, three-quarters of that in the Stanislaus National Forest west of the park, fire officials said.

But a second straight night of cooling temperatures and higher humidity helped firefighters extend containment lines around nearly a third of the fire's perimeter by the start of its 14th day.

"I can't say we've turned a corner just yet, but we are making very good progress," U.S. Forest Service spokesman Dick Fleishman said. "We're going to keep chugging away."

With an overall footprint that now exceeds the land mass of Kansas City, Missouri, the blaze ranks as the fifth-largest California wildfire on record.

In terms of acreage burned, it also stands as the largest of dozens of wildfires that have raged across several states in the drought-parched west this year, straining U.S. firefighting resources.

A force of nearly 5,000 personnel are now assigned to the Rim Fire, mostly ground crews laboring around the clock with hand tools, chain saws and torches to cut fire breaks in the rugged terrain by clearing away unburned trees and dry brush.

They were supported by teams of bulldozers, water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers carrying payloads of flame-retardant chemicals.

Less than a quarter of the total burned acreage from the blaze lies inside Yosemite, and firefighters there have succeeded in limiting most of the damage to wilderness and backcountry areas in the park's remote northwestern corner.

The most popular portions of the park remained open to the public, including the scenic Yosemite Valley area famed for its towering granite rock formations, waterfalls, meadows and pine forests.

Nevertheless, park officials say the droves of visitors who typically crowd Yosemite in late summer have noticeably diminished ahead of the usually busy Labor Day weekend that marks the close of the summer tourist season.

TOURIST ECONOMY

The slump in visitation has in turn put a severe crimp in Yosemite-area businesses whose proprietors were counting on a healthy summer season after last year's hantavirus outbreak frightened away many tourists.

"We're laying off just about everybody, something like 45 employees," Chris Loh, 38, who owns the Iron Door Saloon in Groveland, a gateway town 20 miles west of Yosemite, said on Thursday.

"This is devastating for not just the businesses but the employees and the community," he told Reuters.

One notable casualty was the Strawberry Music Festival, an annual bluegrass jamboree that draws some 5,000 weekend guests to the area but was canceled when the site of the event, Camp Mather just outside the park, was closed, organizers said.

Some 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, most of them during the peak months of June through August.

While firefighters have so far prevented flames from invading the heart of Yosemite, the blaze has forced the closure of one of the park's four entrances and about half of its main east-west corridor, Tioga Road, along with numerous campgrounds, trails and two popular groves of giant sequoia trees.

Dry, hot conditions returned after daybreak on Friday. But calmer winds again favored efforts to check the spread of flames and allowed crews to continue controlled burning to create fire breaks and steer flames away from threatened or high-fuel areas.

Much of the work was devoted to preparing key roadside areas in the park and adjacent forest for controlled burns by hacking away excess vegetation before starting the risky, painstaking process of fighting fire with fire, Fleishman said.

One such containment line was being slowly burned from the edge of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir south to Tioaga road in a bid to fully enclose the fire's eastern flank, fire officials said.

The strategy also appeared to be paying off on the opposite end of the fire zone as an evacuation alert was listed late Thursday for Tuolumne, a town of about 1,800 residents whose homes were among some 4,500 dwellings counted as threatened by the fire all week west of the park.

The fire has destroyed dozens of homes and cabins in the region, but no serious injuries have been reported.



headline: Lawyers for ex-NFL star say murder investigators misled witness
byline: By Daniel Lovering
12:12am EDT

A judge on Friday declined to rule on a motion filed by Aaron Hernandez's lawyers that accused investigators of misleading at least one witness while building their murder case against the former NFL star.

Attleboro District Court Judge Robert Harbour said the motion, along with two others filed by defense attorneys last week, should be handled by Fall River Superior Court where Hernandez's arraignment will take place on September 6.

The hearing came a week after Hernandez, a former New England Patriots tight end, was indicted on murder and weapons charges. He has been accused of the June killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player whose bullet-riddled body was found near Hernandez's house in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

Hernandez appeared briefly in the Attleboro District Court on Friday, handcuffed and wearing a dark blue suit jacket and white open collared shirt, but did not speak. Members of Lloyd's family also attended the hearing.

In one motion, defense attorneys alleged that detectives told a potential witness at a Connecticut prison, Everett Garcia, that they were there "to help Aaron out," and that the meeting occurred a day before the defense team was due to meet with him.

They said investigators deliberately misled Garcia about their purpose in order to get a statement and "breached established ethical rules and may well have committed a criminal offense," according to the motion, which sought to prevent the state from committing such offenses again.

Another motion called for the state to provide the defense with any evidence it may not have provided already.

Prosecutors have denied that police said or implied they were there to "help Aaron out," according to court documents.

Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for the Bristol County district attorney's office, said allegations made in the motions were "simply not accurate" and that investigators had interviewed hundreds of people in the case.

"Our focus is on the tragic murder of Odin Lloyd, and that's our sole focus," he told reporters.

Hernandez, 23, was cut from the Patriots on June 26, shortly after police arrested him for allegedly orchestrating the execution-style murder. Lloyd, 27, had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancĂŠe.

Before his arrest, Hernandez had been a rising star in the NFL with a $40 million contract with the Patriots, one of the National Football League's top teams.

Bob Filner's abbreviated term as San Diego mayor appeared to be ending quietly on Friday as the veteran politician who resigned in the face of a sexual harassment lawsuit remained out of sight on what was scheduled to be his last day in office.

service center, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

There were no initial reports of damage, and the West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami watch, warning or advisory in effect.

"At this point, we've seen no ocean-surface disturbance," said Bill Knight, a scientist at the tsunami warning center in Palmer, Alaska. While no tsunami was expected, he said scientists were still monitoring the area for any earthquake-induced waves.

The earthquake, which struck at 8:25 a.m. Alaska Daylight Time, was strongly felt in Adak, about 1,300 miles southwest of Anchorage, said City Manager Layton Lockett.

"It was kind of hard to miss," Lockett said. "The strangest thing about this one was its length in time. I think people actually had time to get out of bed to see what was going on."

A magnitude 7 earthquake is likely to produce shaking that lasts 20 to 30 seconds, although it could last longer depending on local tectonics, Knight said.

A public radio station in Unalaska/Dutch Harbor, KUCB, interviewed a woman in Adak who said she timed the temblor at 40 seconds. The earthquake was followed by about 10 aftershocks of magnitude 3.5 or higher, Knight said.

Most structures in Adak can withstand earthquakes and other forces of nature, and any damage would likely be limited to water pipes and similar facilities that have yet to be fully examined, Lockett said.

"Generally, the buildings are built really strong. We do live on a volcano," he said of the town, which state records indicate has 321 residents.

There are two volcanoes on Adak Island, along with remnants of a third volcano, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory.

The quake was also felt in Atka, a tiny Aleutian Island Native Aleut village 65 miles northeast of the quake's center, where Knight said callers reported "strong shaking" but no damage.

byline: By Joseph Lichterman and Bernie Woodall
12:12am EDT

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and other state officials are seeking to avoid being questioned by Detroit worker and retiree unions in the city's bankruptcy case, according to a motion filed on Friday.

Attorneys for the state, in a motion to quash depositions of Snyder, Michigan Treasurer Andy Dillon and others, said they would not be able to offer testimony relevant to the issue of whether Detroit is eligible to enter Chapter 9 protection.

The depositions, if they occur, would happen ahead of the late October start to hearings before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes on the eligibility issue.

The city filed the largest-ever municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history on July 18. Snyder, a Republican, had to approve a request from Orr to file for bankruptcy protection.

Ed McNeil of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 25 in Detroit, called Snyder's attempt to dodge being questioned "a cowardly attempt to hide behind a malicious legal maneuver."

The eligibility argument will focus on whether Detroit is insolvent, whether the city negotiated in good faith with its creditors, whether there were too many creditors to make negotiations feasible, and whether Detroit's bankruptcy petition of was filed in bad faith.

"The eligibility determination was made - and could only be made - by the city of Detroit and Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr," the state's motion said.

But McNeil said, "Every step of the way Governor Snyder has tried to stack the deck in his favor. He has blocked all opportunity for meaningful negotiations and mediation. Today's move is another attempt to bend the rules."

The state said the governor's reasoning for allowing the filing were laid out in a public letter Snyder wrote to Orr authorizing the city to seek bankruptcy protection.

It also argued that any request for discovery from state officials should be made after Orr and other city officials are deposed because "there has been no showing that the state officials were involved in any relevant eligibility determinations made prior to the filing of the petition."

Orr was deposed on Friday, but not on the question of the city's eligibility to file for bankruptcy protection.

Orr was deposed by attorneys representing objectors to a proposed deal that would terminate interest-rate swap agreements on casino tax revenue, which were used to hedge interest-rate exposure on some of the city's pension debt, at a discounted rate of as much as 25 percent, saving the city more than $70 million.



headline: EOG Resources says Texas well fire nearly out
byline: By Kristen Hays
12:12am EDT

EOG Resources Inc said on Friday that an Eagle Ford shale oil well fire that has burned since a blowout on Wednesday was nearly out as crews worked to cap it.

"EOG reports that the fire has substantially subsided at its Lavaca County well site and is close to being extinguished," the company said.

EOG said the company would issue a final update when the well is capped.

The fire followed a well rupture and explosion Wednesday evening at the EOG drilling operation about 134 miles west of Houston. No one was hurt.

EOG is the largest oil producer in the prolific Eagle Ford play with output of 173,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day as of June 30, the company said in an investor presentation earlier this month.

Eagle Ford oil production rose to just above 621,000 barrels per day in June, according to the Texas Railroad Commission, 60.2 percent higher than a year earlier.

EOG also said in the presentation that the company has cut its number of drilling days per well to less than 12 days, which reduces cost such as daily rates paid for drilling rigs.

Nabors Industries, which owns the world's largest land-rig fleet, also owns the rig at the burning well. A Nabors official said that the company expected "pretty bad damage" to the rig from the explosion and fire.

EOG is investigating the cause of the incident.



headline: Montana prosecutor to appeal ex-teacher's month-long sentence for rape
byline: By Laura Zuckerman

day sentence for a former teacher who raped a teenage student who later committed suicide.

District Judge G. Todd Baugh has come under harsh criticism since sentencing former Billings high school teacher Stacey Rambold on Monday to 15 years in prison, then suspending all but 31 days of that term, for the 2007 rape of 14-year-old Cherice Moralez.

Before handing down the sentence, Baugh said that Moralez, who committed suicide in 2010, was "probably as much in control of the situation" as Rambold, describing her as a troubled youth who seemed older than her age.

Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito said that Baugh, who has since apologized for his remarks, likely erred by misapplying state criminal codes and sentencing recommendations that would have required a minimum of two years in jail.

"I understand the importance of what has happened here, and we are moving as quickly as we can to right a grave injustice," said Twito, whose office had recommended the judge impose a 20-year jail sentence with half of it suspended.

He said he has spent the last week consulting with appellate experts at the state Attorney General's Office about appealing the sentence before the Montana Supreme Court. The state has 20 days to file such a motion once the judgment is signed by Baugh.

"At the end of the day, you have a girl in our community who has been lost. And you have a family who is still suffering," he said.

Rambold had been charged by Yellowstone County prosecutors in 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, the Montana equivalent of a rape charge, linked to Moralez, a student in a technology class he taught at Senior High School in Billings.

But Moralez killed herself in 2010 before the case could go to trial, crippling a prosecution case that depended on her testimony.

In an agreement with prosecutors later that year, Rambold admitted to a single count of sexual intercourse without consent and prosecutors agreed to postpone the case for three years and dismiss it entirely if Rambold completed sex offender treatment.

Prosecutors reinstated the case after being notified last year by the treatment center that Rambold, who was suspended in 2008 from his teaching post and later resigned, had been dismissed from the program for violating its rules.

In April, Rambold pleaded guilty to the rape charge stemming from the 2007 assault of Moralez in his Billings home, according to legal documents.

examination on Friday that she had gone to the media with her story because she felt a need to talk about the experience.

The woman, now a senior at the elite service academy in Annapolis, Maryland, denied defense attorneys' suggestion that an anti-Navy agenda prompted her to speak out on CNN and in an interview with The New York Times.

Friday marked her third day on the witness stand during a preliminary hearing to determine whether the three former members of the academy's football team accused of raping her will face a full court-martial.

The men - Tra'ves Bush, 22; Eric Graham, 21; and Joshua Tate, 21 - are accused of sexually assaulting her last year while she was passed out after drinking at an off-campus party.

The hearing follows a spate of high-profile military sexual assault cases, including some involving personnel whose job it was to prevent sexual abuse.

The woman was questioned repeatedly about her motives for speaking to media outlets in recent months.

"I had been quiet for so long, I was ready to tell everything that I could," she said. "When the media came to me, I literally just wanted to tell my story - my experience."

In 2012, during the early stages of the investigation, the woman said she didn't want the case to go forward and had not been cooperating with investigators.

A day earlier, Bush's attorneys played a recorded conversation between Tate and the woman in which she asked him to lie about the crime because she did not "want this to go anywhere."

The woman, who was a 20-year-old sophomore at the time of the alleged incident, has testified that she did not want to get anyone in trouble.

She has said she feared her mother would force her to leave the highly selective school, which educates Navy and Marine officers. Students are known as midshipmen.

Reuters generally does not report the names of sexual assault victims.

headline: U.S. says North Korea calls off trip aimed at securing American's release
byline: By Paul Eckert
12:12am EDT

North Korea withdrew its invitation to a U.S. envoy who was headed to Pyongyang to request the release of imprisoned, ailing American missionary Kenneth Bae, the U.S. State Department said on Friday.

North Korea canceled talks with Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, who was expected to visit Pyongyang on Friday and Saturday.

"We are surprised and disappointed by North Korea's decision," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said.

"We remain gravely concerned about Mr. Bae's health and we continue to urge the DPRK authorities to grant Mr. Bae special amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds," the spokeswoman said in a written statement, referring to the North by its formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

There was no immediate explanation for the decision from North Korea, which does not have diplomatic relations with Washington.

King's trip, announced this week as he was visiting U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, was seen as a potential signal of the start of a gradual thaw in relations between Washington and Pyongyang.

The State Department had termed the trip a "humanitarian mission" and played down any connection between Bae's release and diplomacy over the North's sanctioned nuclear weapons program.

Bae's sister in Washington state issued a statement saying their family was disappointed and worried about Kenneth Bae's health, but are "not giving up hope for a peaceful and timely resolution."

"We hold on to faith that DPRK and U.S. diplomats will resume talks soon, ultimately leading to my brother being released," said Terri Chung, Bae's sister.

Representative Rick Larsen, who represents the district where Bae's family lives, urged the North Koreans to free Bae.

"The North Koreans gain nothing from this course reversal. It is time to let Kenneth come home to his family and get the medical attention he needs," Larsen, a Democrat, said in a statement.

King secured the release of another Korean-American missionary, Jung Young Su, in 2011 as part of a trip to assess North Korean pleas for food aid.

FROSTY RELATIONS

Relations between Washington and Pyongyang have been frosty since the collapse of a deal in early 2012, when North Korea broke its promise to end its long-range rocket launches and prevented nuclear inspectors from examining its nuclear stockpile and production.

Nuclear talks involving the United States, China, Japan and the two Koreas have been deadlocked for five years, although Pyongyang in 2005 had signed on to a deal in which it would have frozen its nuclear program in exchange for economic and energy aid. North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006.

North Korea's human rights record has recently come under international scrutiny. A U.N. Public Commission of Inquiry in Seoul on August 20 was told by witnesses that public executions and torture are daily occurrences in the North's prisons.

Bae, 45, was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for attempting to overthrow the North Korean state by spreading anti-government propaganda, according to North Korean media. He has diabetes and his health has deteriorated since he was jailed.

North Korean state media said Bae started his plot to "topple" the country's government in 2006, a date that coincides with his own testimony about his arrival in China.

It accused him of spreading "false propaganda" and of bribing North Korean citizens in a bid to bring down the government.

Bae lived in a Chinese town that borders North Korea and worked for a tour company while undertaking missionary work inside North Korea.

North Korea says it permits religious freedom, but religious expression is tightly controlled in a state that acknowledges total loyalty to the Kim dynasty that has ruled for three generations. North Korea lands at the bottom of most independent surveys of freedom.

In online postings of one of his speeches on his missionary work, Bae described himself and a party he took to North Korea as "warriors for Christ" and told of holding a prayer meeting on a beach.

The postings have since been removed, as have all traces of Bae's involvement with a tour company operating out of China.

In a videotaped sermon, also removed from the Internet, Bae discussed bringing 300 people to a coastal town in North Korea to emulate the biblical destruction of the walls of Jericho.

Bae's family has acknowledged his deeply held religious beliefs but have suggested that his sympathy for North Korean orphans may have been behind his arrest.



headline: UK asked N.Y. Times to destroy Snowden material
byline: By Mark Hosenball
12:12am EDT

The British government has asked the New York Times to destroy copies of documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden related to the operations of the U.S. spy agency and its British partner, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), people familiar with the matter said.

The British request, made to Times executive editor Jill Abramson by a senior official at the British Embassy in Washington D.C., was greeted by Abramson with silence, according to the sources. British officials indicated they intended to follow up on their request later with the Times, but never did, one of the sources said.

On Friday, in a public statement, Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, said his newspaper, which had faced threats of possible legal action from British authorities, on July 20 had destroyed copies of leaked documents which it had received from Snowden.

Rusbridger said that two days later, on July 22, the Guardian informed British authorities that materials related to GCHQ had made their way to the New York Times and the independent investigative journalism group ProPublica.

Rusbridger said in his statement that it then took British authorities "more than three weeks before anyone from the British government contacted the New York Times.

"We understand the British Embassy in Washington met with the New York Times in mid-August - over three weeks after the Guardian's material was destroyed in London. To date, no-one has contacted ProPublica, and there has been two weeks of further silence towards the New York Times from the government," Rusbridger said.

Rusbridger added that, "This five week period in which nothing has happened tells a different story from the alarmist claims made" by the British government in a witness statement it submitted on Friday to a London court hearing regarding an investigation by British authorities into whether the handling of Snowden's leaks violated British anti-terrorism and official secrets laws.

A spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington told Reuters: "We are not going to get into the specifics about our efforts but it should come as no surprise if we approach a person who is in possession of some or all of this material."

The spokesman added: "We have presented a witness statement to the court in Britain which explains why we are trying to secure copies of over 58,000 stolen intelligence documents - to protect public safety and our national security."

A spokeswoman for the New York Times said the paper had no comment.

The British investigation was opened after authorities at London's Heathrow Airport earlier this month used an anti-terrorism law to detain David Miranda, the domestic partner of Glenn Greenwald, a Guardian writer who has met with Snowden and has played a lead role in writing about material the former NSA contractor leaked.

Miranda was held and questioned for nine hours before being allowed to resume his trip from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro, where he and Greenwald live. Greenwald has said that Miranda had carried Snowden related material from him in Brazil to Laura Poitras in Berlin, an American film-maker who has also met with Snowden, and that Miranda was carrying Snowden-related materials which Poitras gave to him back to Greenwald.

In her witness statement submitted to the British court on Friday, Detective Superintendent Caroline Goode, who said she was in charge of Scotland Yard's Snowden-related investigation, said that among materials officials had seized from Miranda while detaining him was an "external hard drive" containing data encrypted by a system called "True Crypt," which Goode said "renders the material extremely difficult to access."

Goode said the hard drive contained around 60 gigabytes of data, "of which only 20 have been accessed to date." She said that she had been advised that the hard drive contains "approximately 58,000 UK documents which are highly classified in nature, to the highest level."

Goode said the process to decode the material was complex and that "so far only 75 documents have been reconstructed since the property was initially received."

Goode also said that it was "likely" that Scotland Yard "is investigating a conspiracy with a global dimension. It is necessary to ascertain if this stolen, classified material has been disseminated to others in order to prevent further disclosure which would prove valuable to terrorists, thereby preventing further offences and protecting public safety."

She also said that "Disclosure of any information contained within those documents would be gravely injurious to UK interests, would directly put lives at risk and would pose a risk to public safety and diminish the ability to counter terrorism."



headline: U.S. plans reports on secret court orders to telecom providers
byline: By Alina Selyukh
12:12am EDT

The U.S. intelligence community has pledged to disclose more data about government surveillance programs by reporting annually how many secret court orders are issued to telecommunications companies under certain legal rules.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Thursday announced a plan to release the total number of legal orders issued every 12 months to telecom companies by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and the number of targets affected by those orders.

The court orders, under authority granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and National Security letters, allow collection of information about subscribers and call records, both for past communications and ongoing wiretaps. But only the aggregate annual numbers of these court orders will be made public.

The move is part of President Barack Obama's response to criticism about a lack of transparency in government surveillance programs following leaks by former spy agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Earlier this month, the government for the first time released opinions, previously labeled Top Secret, from the FISA Court. In the past its decisions involving electronic surveillance and communications collection by the National Security Agency had not been made public.

Privacy advocates have been urging the government to start shedding light on the FISA court and its surveillance operations and offered a tempered welcome to Thursday's news.

"This is a good start as it pulls back the covers a bit on the government authorities, but we still need more information," said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center advocacy group. It urged further disclosures about the cost and effectiveness of the surveillance.

Kurt Opsahl, senior staff attorney at the data privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation, expressed concerns that the pledge to release the number of affected investigation targets could severely limit the amount of data to be actually released.

"The number of targets affected isn't as much the issue on the public's mind as the number of innocent people affected," he said, pointing to the leaked secret FISC order to Verizon Communications Inc that did not address any targets.

Obama and other U.S. officials have said the NSA surveillance programs are lawful, have been approved by Congress and the FISA Court, and are aimed at detecting and disrupting terrorist plots.

"FISA and national security letters are an important part of our effort to keep the nation and its citizens safe, and disclosing more detailed information about how they are used and to whom they are directed can obviously help our enemies avoid detection," Clapper said in a statement announcing the new plan on Thursday.

The FISA court has said the NSA may unintentionally have collected as many as 56,000 emails of Americans a year from 2008 to 2011 and may have violated the Constitution before adjustments were made.



headline: Judge rules U.S. military cannot deny benefits to lesbian veteran and her wife
byline: By Alex Dobuzinskis
12:12am EDT

sex marriage because doing so does not serve any purpose for the armed forces, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.

The decision, which could set the stage for gay and lesbian veterans and their partners to claim those benefits, follows a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in June that invalidated a key portion of the U.S. Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that had defined marriage as between a man and a woman.

U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall, a federal judge based in Los Angeles, made the latest ruling in the case of a lawsuit filed last year by a U.S. Army veteran and her lesbian spouse.

The couple's attorneys had sought an order from the judge that would find unconstitutional a federal statute that denies benefits to U.S. military veterans in same-sex unions.

The lawsuit centers on a statute governing military benefits that defines spouse and surviving spouse to refer to those in opposite sex marriages.

Judge Marshall in her ruling cited evidence that the purpose of the spousal benefits was, in part, to ensure that service members perform to their highest potential and to make it easier to recruit and train Americans to join the armed forces.

"The denial of benefits to spouses in same-sex marriages is not rationally related to any of these military purposes," Marshall wrote.

Marshall in her decision noted that the Supreme Court, in its decision striking down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act, did not rule on the constitutionality of the statute that limits spousal benefits for veterans to those who are in heterosexual marriages.

A representative for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs could not be reached for comment late on Thursday.

The department had indicated that legislation was needed to grant veterans in same-sex marriages benefits for their spouses, the office of U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, said in a statement earlier this week.

Tracey Cooper-Harris, who sued in the case before Judge Marshall, served nine years in active duty with the U.S. Army, including a 2003 tour in Kuwait that resulted in her being sent into Iraq during the U.S.-led war, according to her complaint.

She was married to her partner and co-plaintiff in the case, Maggie Cooper-Harris, in Los Angeles in 2008.

Tracey Cooper-Harris was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2010 and, in anticipation of her possible death, she sought to make arrangements to provide for the support of her wife, according to the lawsuit.

But while the Department of Veterans Affairs found Tracey Cooper-Harris's disease was related to her service and awarded her disability compensation, she was told her spouse would not qualify for survivor benefits if she dies, the lawsuit stated.

The lawsuit said such treatment "demeans" the pair's marriage and also "the remarkable sacrifices" of Tracey Cooper-Harris in the U.S. armed forces.

headline: Married gay couples win U.S. marriage tax benefits nationwide
byline: By Kevin Drawbaugh and Kim Dixon
12:12am EDT

All legally wed gay couples, no matter which state they live in, are entitled to the same U.S. federal tax benefits as married heterosexual couples, the Obama administration said on Thursday.

The U.S. Treasury ruling, following a landmark Supreme Court decision in June, means that whether a married gay couple lives in New York, which recognizes gay marriage, or Oklahoma, which does not, federal tax benefits and responsibilities apply.

The Supreme Court on June 26 invalidated a key portion of a 1996 federal law, known as the Defense of Marriage Act, which had defined marriage as between a man and a woman.

There was some uncertainty after the Supreme Court ruling about how the tax status of gay married couples would be treated in dozens of states that have laws against gay marriage.

"Today's ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve," Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said.

There are about 130,000 same-sex married couples in the United States, according to estimates from the Census Bureau.

Gay rights backers said the ruling could prompt same-sex couples in states where gay marriage is not legal to travel to states where it is recognized to wed.

"We will see many more couples from the more than 30 states without marriage equality come to New York," said Nathan Schaeffer, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda.

APPLIES RETROACTIVELY

Under the ruling, effective September 16, gay married couples may file amended tax returns to change their filing status going back to tax years 2010, 2011 and 2012 to seek possible tax refunds, the Treasury Department said in a statement.

A Supreme Court ruling in June made California the 13th of the 50 U.S. states to recognize gay marriage. The District of Columbia also recognizes gay marriage. Thirty-five U.S. states have laws on their books restricting marriage to a man and a woman.

"With today's ruling, committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation's federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home," said Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin.

The ruling means legally married same-sex couples may choose to file their federal taxes as married filing jointly or married filing separately.

Marriage status under federal tax law brings both benefits and penalties. On the plus side, legally married spouses are exempted from the federal estate tax. On the other hand, some gay couples above a certain income threshold may face the "marriage penalty" that some heterosexual couples confront.

An anti-gay marriage group denounced the ruling.

"The Obama administration is intent on forcing same-sex 'marriage' on an unwilling public," said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage.

STATE ISSUES

While the ruling brings clarity to federal tax returns, it could cause confusion for state returns filed by gay married couples in states that do not recognize their marriages.

In 24 of the states that do not recognize gay marriage, the law requires taxpayers to refer to federal tax returns, setting up a clash between state and federal authorities, the Tax Foundation, a conservative leaning think tank said in a report.

"Today's ruling will likely create administrative headaches for state taxing authorities in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages, because most state income tax regimes begin with federal taxable income as the starting point," Marvin Kirsner, a tax attorney at Greenberg Traurig, wrote in an email.

"States are going to have to issue guidance and I do think political opposition will arise," said Elizabeth Malm, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a free market think tank.

PUBLIC SUPPORT GROWS

President Barack Obama and many of his fellow Democrats back gay marriage, but the number of supporters in both parties has been increasing in recent years. Republicans were parties to the Supreme Court lawsuit over the Defense of Marriage Act, but were mostly quiet after the court ruled.

A spokesman for John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said he had no comment on the latest ruling announced by the Treasury Department.

Separately on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said same-sex spouses would have access to coverage in the nursing home where their spouse lives under privately run Medicare health insurance plans.

Other government agencies are expected to make announcements soon to square their policies with the Supreme Court ruling.

For example, the Social Security and Veterans administrations have statutes that turn to state law in defining marriage. Gay marriage backers are awaiting clarification from those agencies on treatment of legally married gay couples.

old student who later killed herself and the judge's remarks suggesting the victim was partly at fault.

District Judge G. Todd Baugh has come under harsh criticism since sentencing former Billings high school teacher Stacey Rambold on Monday to 15 years in prison, then suspending all but 31 days of that term, for the 2007 rape of Cherice Moralez. Rambold, 54, also received credit for one day served.

Before handing down the sentence Baugh said that Moralez, who committed suicide in 2010, was "probably as much in control of the situation" as Rambold and that the teen seemed older than her age.

The judge, who apologized for his remarks on Wednesday, made an appearance at the protest but did not speak, said Marian Bradley, president of the Montana chapter of National Organization for Women and co-organizer of the rally. Auliea Hanlon, the dead girl's mother, also attended the rally, which organizers said drew 500-700 people.

Kate Olp, co-organizer of the Billings protest and an online petition demanding that Baugh step down, said his comments may lead victims of sexual assault to avoid reporting it for fear of mistreatment by the legal system.

"He took the responsibility off the shoulders of an adult and placed it on the fragile shoulders of a child," she said.

Demonstrators observed two minutes of silence for Moralez and her mother, Olp said.

"I looked up and it was absolutely unbelievable. I looked out over the crowd. There were tears everywhere; people were crying, men and women," she said.

In sentencing Rambold, Baugh ignored a recommendation by prosecutors for a 20-year term with half of it suspended for the 2007 rape of Moralez, then a student in a technology class taught by Rambold at Senior High School in Billings.

Rambold was charged in 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, the Montana equivalent of rape.

Moralez killed herself in 2010 while the case was pending. Prosecutors struck a deal with Rambold in which he admitted to a single rape charge to be dismissed in three years if he successfully completed sex offender treatment.

The case against Rambold, who was suspended in 2008 from his teaching post and ultimately resigned, was reinstated after prosecutors learned he had been expelled from the treatment program for breaking its rules.

He pleaded guilty in April to sexual intercourse without consent stemming from the 2007 assault of Moralez.

At the sentencing hearing Monday, Rambold's attorney, Jay Lansing, argued his client had been sufficiently punished by losing his job, his marriage and his self-esteem in the aftermath of the rape charges, court records show.



headline: Sandusky prison letter blasts Penn State settlements with victims
byline: By Daniel Kelley
12:12am EDT

Disgraced former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted of sexually abusing boys, in a letter from prison lashed out at the school's legal settlements with his victims.

Sandusky, who last year was convicted of 45 counts of abusing 10 boys over a 15-year period, in a letter to a documentary filmmaker seeking to exonerate Sandusky's former boss, Joe Paterno, argued that the school didn't take steps to defend its employees.

"The only concern from the beginning of this by administrators and trustees has been to protect their image," Sandusky wrote. "They didn't question what they called 'victims,' instead they opened their arms and offered settlements, psychologists, public events and media presentations."

Sandusky, who has denied any criminal activity, raised his complaints in a hand-written letter dated August 20 to filmmaker John Ziegler, who runs a blog called "The Framing of Joe Paterno."

Paterno, the winningest coach in Division I college football history until he was stripped of more than 100 victories because of the scandal, lost his job for failing to report Sandusky to authorities. He died early last year at the age of 85, about two months after he was fired.

Penn State officials did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Sandusky's letter focuses on one victim in particular, a man identified in court documents as Victim 5, who testified against Sandusky at trial and who was the first to reach a legal settlement with the school.

Victim 5's case was seen as one of the most significant for the school, because his abuse occurred in August 2001, six months after then-graduate assistant Mike McQueary reported seeing Sandusky raping a boy in a campus shower, according to Tom Kline, Victim 5's lawyer.

Sandusky wrote that his lawyer viewed Victim 5's claims as inconsistent and not worth focusing on.

"Mr. Sandusky, who is appropriately spending the rest of his life in jail, is simply lashing out," Kline said. "Make no mistake about it, the testimony given by my client was accurate and compelling."

Sandusky, 69, is serving a 30 to 60 year sentence.

Penn State has reached settlements with 25 of 31 men who claimed they were abused by Sandusky when they were boys, Kline said.

The terms of those settlements have not been disclosed, but the school has authorized $60 million in payouts.

Former university President Graham Spanier and two other former university officials face trial on charges they conspired to cover up the 2001 abuse case reported by McQueary.



headline: Massive wildfire prompts new travel restrictions through Yosemite
byline: By Laila Kearney
12:12am EDT

Firefighters determined to keep a massive blaze from invading the heart of California's Yosemite National Park took advantage of cooler weather early on Thursday to slow the spread of flames ahead of a holiday weekend marking the end of the peak summer tourist season.

Progress came after a long stretch of Yosemite's main east-west road was closed on Wednesday through the western half of the park as crews tightened their grip on the blaze, extending containment lines around 30 percent of the fire's perimeter by the end of its 12th day.

Capping a week in which the footprint of the blaze grew by tens of thousands of acres, a cooling trend and rising humidity levels helped curb the fire's growth overnight, with just 270 acres added to the tally of charred landscape by dawn on Thursday.

Since erupting on August 17, the so-called Rim Fire has blackened nearly 193,000 acres, or more than 300 square miles of dry scrub and timberlands, mostly in the Stanislaus National Forest west of the park, fire officials said on Thursday. Its cause was still being investigated.

The firefighting force has grown to more than 4,800 personnel, consisting mostly of crews wielding hand tools, chain saws and even special torches to create fire breaks by clearing the rugged terrain of unburned trees and chaparral ahead of advancing flames.

They are backed by teams of bulldozers, water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers carrying payloads of flame-retardant chemicals.

The battle inside Yosemite was focused largely on preventing flames from penetrating any farther toward the core of the park, including the Yosemite Valley area famed for its towering rock formations, waterfalls, meadows and pine forests.

Some 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, most of them during the peak months of June through August. Park officials said they have already noticed a decline in the crowds of visitors typically seen in late summer.

BIGGER THAN CHICAGO

With an overall footprint that exceeds the land mass of The city of Chicago, the blaze ranks as the sixth-largest California wildfire on record.

As of Wednesday, less than a quarter of the total burned landscape, about 43,000 acres, lay inside Yosemite, confined to the northwest corner of the 750,000-acre (300,000-hectare) park.

Earlier this week, flames closed in on the park's Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, which supplies 85 percent of the water consumed by San Francisco and several other communities some 200 miles to the west.

But utility officials said there was little risk to the artificial lake because of the rocky terrain and lack of brush surrounding it.

On the opposite end of the sprawling fire zone west of Yosemite, crews fought to keep flames away from some 4,500 homes in a string of small communities along the fringe of the Stanislaus National Forest, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Dennis Matheson.

Most of those dwellings have been ordered evacuated or were under advisories urging residents to leave voluntarily or be ready to flee at a moment's notice. The fire has already destroyed dozens of homes and cabins, but no serious injuries have been reported.

DEFENDING YOSEMITE'S CORE

Matheson said treacherous, hard-to-reach terrain was hindering efforts to carve additional containment lines around the blaze, and he estimated it would take another week to fully enclose it.

"I think it's very safe to say that we're looking at least at the first week of September," Matheson said.

The flames last week forced the closure of a stretch of Highway 120 that leads into the west side of the park and serves as the main gateway from the San Francisco Bay area.

On Wednesday, the closure was extended eastward along 120, also called Tioga Road, as far as Yosemite Creek midway through the park. But the rest of the road through Yosemite's only east entrance remained open, along with two other gates that allow access from other directions in the southern half of the park.

The expanded closure of Highway 120 - the only east-west route that completely bisects the park - was imposed to allow fire crews to establish new containment lines along the road before the blaze approaches, said Yosemite spokesman Tom Medema.

"That will limit the access for visitors to and from the east side of the park, quite possibly over Labor Day weekend, which will have a significant economic impact on the area and (be)an inconvenience for visitors," he said.

Several campgrounds and trails, along with two landmark groves of giant sequoia trees, also were closed to the public.

Firefighters on Thursday also continued to burn containment lines from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir south to Tioga Road in a bid to keep the fire from creeping further east into the park, Medema said.

The blaze has been among the fastest-moving of dozens of large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West in recent weeks, straining national firefighting resources.



headline: U.S. allows states to legalize recreational marijuana within limits
byline: By David Ingram
12:12am EDT

In a move marijuana advocates hailed as an historic shift, the Obama administration on Thursday began giving U.S. states wide leeway to experiment with pot legalization and started by letting Colorado and Washington carry out new laws permitting recreational use.

The Justice Department said it would refocus marijuana enforcement nationwide by bringing criminal charges only in eight defined areas - such as distribution to minors - and giving breathing room to users, growers and related businesses that have feared prosecution.

The decisions end nearly a year of deliberation inside President Barack Obama's administration about how to react to the growing movement for relaxed U.S. marijuana laws.

Advocates for legalization welcomed the announcement as a major step toward ending what they called "marijuana prohibition."

"Today's announcement demonstrates the sort of political vision and foresight from the White House we've been seeking for a long time," said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group.

"I must admit, I was expecting a yellow light from the White House," he said in a statement. "But this light looks a lot more green-ish than I had hoped. The White House is basically saying to Washington and Colorado: Proceed with caution."

Marijuana remains illegal and tightly controlled under federal law, even as about 20 states, plus the District of Columbia, allow the use of medical marijuana. Voters in Colorado and Washington legalized recreational use in groundbreaking ballot measures in November 2012.

Obama had signaled he did not want a new crackdown, telling ABC News in December: "It does not make sense, from a prioritization point of view, for us to focus on recreational drug users in a state that has already said that's legal."

The leeway for the states will go only so far, though, if Colorado, Washington or other states show they are unable to control the drug, the Justice Department said in a statement.

Forty-two percent of Americans age 12 or older have used marijuana at some point, according to a 2011 survey by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Obama has said he used marijuana when he was young.

One opponent of marijuana legalization said his group would redouble efforts to spread word of the negative effects the drug can have on adolescents.

"This is going to really quicken the realization among folks that more marijuana in our communities is not a good thing," said Kevin Sabet, a co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana.

U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Obama administration should not decline to enforce laws that it finds inconvenient or that it does not like.

"This sends the wrong message to both law enforcement and violators of federal law. Apprehending and prosecuting illegal drug traffickers should always be a priority for the Department of Justice," Grassley said in a statement.

EIGHT AREAS IN FOCUS

The Justice Department could have sued to block the Colorado and Washington laws from taking effect under the theory that they conflict with the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, the primary U.S. anti-drug law.

Coupled with the decision not to sue, the Justice Department sent a four-page memorandum to federal prosecutors nationwide outlining eight priority areas for marijuana enforcement.

While department officials said they are committed to enforcing federal restrictions on marijuana, prosecutors have now been told not to expend effort on cases unless they fall in one of the eight areas.

The areas include distribution to minors, situations when marijuana revenue is going to other criminal enterprises, trafficking across state lines and growing on public land.

The criteria mean, for example, that federal prosecutors will not charge a marijuana dispensary simply because it is large or profitable, said a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

But the criteria also stop short of guaranteeing immunity for anyone, leaving business and individuals open to prosecution if the case fits one of the eight areas, the official said.

Colorado and Washington will need to have regulatory systems to protect against those types of crimes, or else risk giving up the whole experiment, the department said in a statement.

Attorney General Eric Holder had a phone call on Thursday with the governors of Colorado and Washington to inform them of the decisions and told them there would be a "trust but verify" relationship between the Justice Department and the states, said the department official.

State officials said they shared Holder's concerns.

"This reflects a balanced approach by the federal government that respects the states' interests in implementing these laws and recognizes the federal government's role in fighting illegal drugs and criminal activity," Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson, both of whom are Democrats, said in a statement.

An Eastern black rhinoceros, a critically endangered species, was born at Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo this week, the first in 24 years, officials said on Thursday.

The male calf, weighing 60 pounds at birth, was born on Monday to first-time mother, Kapuki, age 8, according to the zoo. The father is 27-year-old Maku.

Black rhinos were nearly driven to extinction in the 1990s. They are a major poaching target, mainly due to the misconception that their horns have medicinal value.

There are 5,055 Eastern black rhinos in the wild, and 68 Eastern black rhinos in 25 accredited zoos across North America. Lincoln Park has three adults of the species.

"The calf divides his time between nursing, following mom around, and napping, and that is exactly what a baby rhino should be doing," Mark Kamhout, mammals curator, said in a statement.

Rhinos are tricky to breed - the gestational period is 15-16 months and parents have "incredibly small windows for conception," Kamhout said.

"Together with the zoo's endocrinologists, we worked to pinpoint the exact window for Kapuki and Maku to get together for breeding," Kahhout said.

The mother and calf will be off display for a couple of weeks while they bond, the zoo said.

The Atlanta zoo saw the birth of its first-ever eastern black rhino earlier this month.



headline: U.S. appeals court upholds California ban on gay-conversion therapy
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
4:46am EDT

California's ban on a controversial therapy aimed at reversing homosexuality in children was upheld by a federal appeals court on Thursday that dismissed arguments by opponents of the measure who contended it violated free speech and parental rights.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling concluded that the so-called gay-conversion therapy ban does not violate the constitutional rights of counselors, minor patients or their parents.

"California has authority to prohibit licensed mental health providers from administering therapies that the legislature has deemed harmful," the ruling said.

The ruling by a three-judge panel resolved two lawsuits seeking to stop implementation of the measure, which prohibits therapists from performing sexual-orientation change counseling with children and teens under age 18.

Democratic Governor Jerry Brown signed the ban into law in September, making the nation's most populous state the first to prohibit the treatment, also known as reparative therapy, among youths. New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie signed a similar measure into law earlier this month.

The California ban marked a major victory for gay rights advocates, who say the treatment lacks a medical basis and can psychologically harm gay and lesbian youth.

Implementation of the law had been on hold pending the suits filed by Christian groups seeking to block it. The California Psychological Association and the California Board of Behavioral Sciences supported the ban.

A spokesman for state Attorney General Kamala Harris, who has defended the law, said she was not immediately available to comment. State Senator Ted Lieu of Torrance, the bill's author, applauded the decision.

"Today's federal court opinion puts another nail in the coffin for the discredited and harmful practice of gay-conversion therapy," he said in a statement. "Now the law has caught up to the truth: Sexual orientation is not a mental illness or defect."

Mat Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel, which had earlier obtained an injunction to block the law, issued a renewed criticism of the ban as politically motivated and "an astounding overreach by the state."

"Legislators and judges in the state of California have essentially barged into the private therapy rooms of victimized young people," Staver said in a statement.

olds.

Lawyers for the Pennsylvania Department of Health included the statement in their lawsuit against a county clerk who has been issuing marriage licenses to gay couples despite a state ban on same-sex nuptials.

"Had the Clerk issued marriage licenses to twelve-year-olds in violation of state law, would anyone seriously contend that each twelve-year-old has a legally enforceable 'interest' in his 'license' and is entitled to a hearing on the validity of his 'license,' else his due process rights be violated?" the state lawyers wrote.

Charles Joughin, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, said not only is the statement offensive, it is flawed.

"Same-sex couples enter into marriage for the same reasons as opposite-sex couples: love, commitment and family. Children are not capable of giving consent, a critical component of legal marriage," Joughin said in a statement.

Pennsylvania General Counsel James Schultz said the media mischaracterized the statement.

"Contrary to recent headlines, the administration does NOT equate same-sex marriage to the marriage of minors," Schultz said in a statement. The state's intention, he said, was to give examples of "other individuals whose marriages were excluded under state law."

But Timothy Haggerty, a historian at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who has studied the gay rights movement, called the statement "incredibly condescending."

"It's suggesting that adult members of our society are incapable of entering into contract because of their sexual orientation," Haggerty said. "It's calling gay relationships adolescent, which has long been a tool of homophobia."

The state last month sued Montgomery County Clerk D. Bruce Hanes in an attempt to stop him from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in suburban Philadelphia, a practice he started after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages in states where it is legal. Soon after the high court ruled, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced she would not defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage.

Thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia recognize gay marriage. Pennsylvania is among six potential states targeted by gay marriage advocates for a future push to legalize same sex nuptials in 2015 and 2016, according to the Freedom to Marry advocacy group.

A poll conducted by Franklin &amp; Marshall College in May found that 54 percent of Pennsylvanians surveyed support gay marriage. Another conducted in August found 76 percent disagreed with the Montgomery County clerk's decision to issue same-sex marriage licenses in violation of current state law.

On Thursday, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service announced that legally married gay and lesbian couples will be recognized as married for federal tax purposes even if the couples live in or move to a state that does not recognize marriage for same-sex couples.



headline: Third friend of accused Boston bomber indicted for misleading probe
byline: By Richard Valdmanis
12:12am EDT

A third college friend of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was indicted on charges he lied to federal investigators, the U.S. Attorney General for Massachusetts said in a statement on Thursday.

Robel Phillipos, 19, was one of the three people who removed a backpack full of fireworks and a laptop from Tsarnaev's dormitory room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth days after the April 15 attack, and later lied about it, prosecutors claim.

The two other students, Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov - both from Kazakhstan - have already been indicted on obstruction charges and detained pending trial. They have pleaded not guilty.

Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan, ethnic Chechens, are believed to have set off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the world-renowned marathon's finish line, killing three people and maiming scores of others in one of the worst attacks on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police a few days after the bombing. Dzhokhar was captured and imprisoned pending trial on terrorism charges.

According to the indictment against Phillipos, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sent a text message to Kadyrbayev on April 18, shortly after the FBI published pictures of the bombing suspects, asking his friend to go to his "room and take what's there."

The three men allegedly took the laptop, backpack and other items from Tsarnaev's room later that day and put them in a dumpster in nearby New Bedford. Investigators later recovered the items from a landfill, according to the indictment.

Phillipos, along with Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, concealed his actions during interviews with federal investigators between April 19 and April 25, according to the indictment.

"In so doing, he made numerous false and misleading statements to the agents," according to the statement from the office of U.S. Attorney General for Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz.

Phillipos, who has been under house arrest since May, faces up to 16 years in prison if convicted. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov face up to 25 years in jail or deportation.

Next year's Boston Marathon will include an additional 9,000 runners, boosting the field size to 36,000, amid a groundswell of support and interest in the wake of the bombing attack, the marathon's organizers said on Thursday.



headline: U.S. fast-food workers protest, demand a 'living wage'

long campaign to raise service sector wages.

Rallies were held in cities from New York to Oakland and stretched into the South, historically difficult territory for organized labor.

The striking workers say they want to unionize without retaliation in order to collectively bargain for a "living wage."

They are demanding $15 an hour, more than twice the federal minimum of $7.25. The median wage for front-line fast-food workers is $8.94 per hour, according to an analysis of government data by the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an advocacy group for lower-wage workers.

"It's almost impossible to get by (alone)," said McDonald's worker Rita Jennings, 37, who was among about 100 protesters who marched in downtown Detroit Thursday. "You have to live with somebody to make it."

Jennings said that in her 11 years at McDonald's, she has never received a raise above her wage of $7.40 an hour.

food workers at two different chains presented their managers with "strike letters" before walking out, Roger Sikes, a coordinator with the nonprofit group Atlanta Jobs With Justice, told Reuters.

And in Oakland, about 80 fast-food workers from various restaurants and their supporters rallied outside a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet.

"I'm doing it for the respect for myself and for my other coworkers," said Ryan Schuetz, 20, who works at McDonald's. He said his work hours have been reduced recently and that he was struggling to keep a roof over his head.

Several politicians came out in support of the protesters on Thursday.

In New York City, mayoral candidate and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn joined several hundred demonstrators outside a McDonald's in midtown Manhattan, holding a sign that read "On Strike: Wages Too Damn Low."

"Better pay will put more money into local businesses and spur economic growth," Democratic Representative George Miller of California said in a statement.

Robert Hiltonsmith, a policy analyst at Demos, a liberal think tank, said that if the minimum wage had kept up with productivity and inflation, it would be closer to $17 per hour.

He added that in many cases, low pay wasn't justified by a worker's lack of marketable skills.

"Seventy percent of these fast-food workers are aged 20 or over, so they're not teenagers, and of that 70 percent, about a third of them have college degrees," he said.

"So it's not that they don't have skills - in many cases, the jobs aren't there for them."

MOMENTUM BUILDING

Thursday's demonstrations in 60 cities followed several smaller strikes this year in the $200 billion U.S. fast-food sector, organizers said.

Last November, some 200 workers walked off their fast-food jobs in New York City, and groups in Chicago, Kansas City, Detroit and other cities followed their lead in April and July.

Fast-food wage activists are now receiving financial and technical support from the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).

Their active online presence echoes Occupy Wall Street - a movement that several supporters of the protests cited as an inspiration.

Restaurant chains and trade groups say the protests are unwarranted because fast-food and retail outlets provide Americans with millions of good jobs with competitive pay and ample opportunities to rise through the ranks.

"Our history is full of examples of individuals who worked their first job with McDonald's and went on to successful careers both within and outside of McDonald's," the company said in a statement.

In an emailed statement, Burger King said the company respects the rights of its workers but "does not make hiring, firing or other employment-related decisions for our franchisees."

The restaurant chains have not changed their wage policies despite the recent strikes.

The National Retail Federation called the strikes "further proof that the labor movement (has) abdicated their role in an honest and rational discussion about the American workforce."

And in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, the conservative Employment Policies Institute ran a full-page ad with a picture of a robot making pancakes, warning that higher wages would mean "fewer entry-level jobs and more automated alternatives."

"You can either raise prices and lose customers, or (automate) those jobs," said Michael Saltsman, EPI's research director. "The idea that restaurants are rolling in the money is not representative of the situation franchisees face."

Dorian Warren, an assistant professor of political science at Columbia University who has published work on labor organizing and inequality, said new protests in the South are "a huge, huge deal."

"The South has always been the model for low wage employment, from slavery to the Jim Crow laws, to the present. It's also the most anti-union part of the country, so the fact that workers feel empowered enough to take collective action is enormous," he noted.



headline: NFL, former players in $765 million deal to settle concussion suit
byline: By Scott Malone
4:46am EDT

The National Football League has agreed to pay $765 million to settle a lawsuit brought by thousands of former players, many suffering from dementia and health problems, who accused the league of hiding the dangers of brain injury while profiting from the sport's violence.

The deal announced on Thursday comes a week before the NFL begins a new season and could resolve a long-running concern for team owners, who faced the prospect of a possibly lengthy trial that could have delved deeply into how well the league understood the toll that football can take on its players.

Sports business experts described the settlement, which will be paid out over decades, as a modest amount of money for the NFL, believed to generate total revenue of $9 billion or $10 billion a year.

But they also said the more than 4,500 former players who brought their case in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania could have a struggled to prove each plaintiff's health problems was a direct result of years on the playing field.

"It would certainly seem to be fair financial terms to the NFL as an enterprise, especially given how difficult this lawsuit has been from a PR and perception viewpoint on both the NFL and the sport of football," said Robert Boland, professor of sports management at New York University. "This is a very positive end for the NFL."

In recent years, there have been a spate of suicides among current and former NFL players, including Jovan Belcher, Junior Seau, Ray Easterling and Dave Duerson. While none of those deaths could be directly connected to football, violent and erratic behavior is consistent with symptoms of a condition tied to the repeated hits to the head that players endure during games and practices.

A growing body of academic research shows those hits can lead to a condition known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which can lead to aggression and dementia.

The research has already prompted the NFL to make changes in play, including banning the most dangerous helmet-to-helmet hits and requiring teams to keep players who have taken hits to the head off the field if they show symptoms including gaps in memory or dizziness.

"This is an important step that builds on the significant changes we've made in recent years to make the game safer, and we will continue our work to better the long-term health and well-being of NFL players," said NFL Executive Vice President Jeffrey Pash.

The league agreed to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation and a program of medical research as well as to cover some legal expenses, according to a court filing.

The NFL admitted no wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement.

ALL, AND ONLY, RETIREES

The settlement will cover all former NFL players but none still in uniform once approved by U.S. District Judge Anita Brody, who in July ordered both sides to meet with mediator Layn Phillips, a retired federal judge.

"The NFL has decided to stand up for all of the former players who are suffering from brain injuries," Kevin Turner, a former running back for the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots who served as a lead plaintiff in the case, told reporters on a conference call.

"The compensation provided in this settlement will lift a huge burden off the men who are suffering right now," said Turner, 44, who struggled to speak clearly due to Lou Gehrig's disease, which he said is linked to his eight years in the league. "They'll no longer have to make decisions regarding their health based on what they can afford but they can make it based on what is the best treatment."

Not all former players welcomed the deal.

"Big loss for the players now and the future! Estimated NFL revenue by 2025 = $27 billion," Kevin Mawae, a former center with the Seattle Seahawks, New York Jets and Tennessee Titans who previously served as president of the NFL Players' Association, said on Twitter.

The settlement spares the league from revealing all its records related to brain injuries in players, which likely would have come out had the case gone to trial.

A blanket settlement - with some of the money to be paid out over two decades - also helps the league by reducing the risk of a large jury award. The bulk of the money - $675 million - will be set aside for player benefits, to be paid out depending on symptoms, with diagnoses of Lou Gehrig's disease, formally known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, getting the largest payout, $5 million.

"It's far better than the alternative ... a constant drip, drip, drip of the NFL looking like they're strong-arming their former players," said David Carter, executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California.

The league had said it disclosed the information it had regarding research into brain trauma. It had previously argued that the lawsuit was inappropriate because the issue of player safety is governed by the collective bargaining agreements negotiated between the league and the players' union.

stricken wife because she had asked him to stop her pain "for good."

school janitor, was arrested early Wednesday without incident after he called 911 and said he had shot his wife, Virginia Chumbley, police officials told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Virginia Chumbley, 44, was found shot three times in the face at the couple's home early Wednesday.

"She told me she wanted to end the pain," Chumbley told the local WKYT TV station in an interview late Wednesday from the Laurel County jail where he was being held, about 72 miles southeast of Lexington, Kentucky.

"I said, 'Jay,' I said, 窶連ll I've got is what the doctors gave you, the medicine, the pain pills.'" She said, 'No. I took enough of them. I want you to stop my pain for good,'" Chumbley said in the interview.

A local law enforcement official said he had concerns about the circumstances of Virginia Chumbley's death.

"I'm a long way from calling it a mercy killing," said Detective Charlie Loomis of the Laurel County Sheriff's Office. "I'm not going to swallow that right yet."

Virginia Chumbley had previously battled breast cancer that had spread to other areas of her body, Loomis said. She was in cancer treatment at the time of her death, though he couldn't say if it was still breast cancer.

According to the TV report, Chris Chumbley said his wife was suffering from breast cancer.

Chumbley remained in jail Thursday in lieu of $200,000 bond, Loomis said.

After responding to Chumbley's call early Wednesday, police found him waiting for them in the living room, near the front door, and arrested him without incident, Loomis said.

Loomis said he had not checked Chumbley's criminal record, but cited neighbors as having observed "issues" in the past between the couple, who have grown children and at least one grandchild who didn't live with them.

The two were married for more than 20 years, and Virginia Chumbley was not working at the time of her death, Loomis said.



headline: Boston Marathon to accept another 9,000 runners in 2014

12:12am EDT

Next year's Boston Marathon will include an additional 9,000 runners, amid a groundswell of support and interest in the wake of the bombing attack this year which killed three people and cut the event short, the marathon's organizers said Thursday.

Boosting the field size to 36,000 runners at the April 21, 2014, race would make for the second-largest turnout in its history, since 38,708 runners toed the starting line in Hopkinton, Massachusetts at the race's 100th anniversary in 1996.

"We understand many marathoners and qualifiers want to run Boston in 2014, and we appreciate the support and patience that the running community has demonstrated because of the bombings that occurred this past spring," said Tom Grilk, executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the race.

The increase, a one-time break from the race's normal cap of 27,000 runners, will help to accommodate the 5,624 athletes who were still on the course this year, when a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs exploded amid thousands of spectators, volunteers and athletes at the finish line and brought the race to a halt.

The attacks prompted an intense investigation, with law enforcement officials combing both the scene and thousands of still and video images received of Boston's best-attended sporting event.

Three days after the April 15 attack, FBI officials released photos of two men they believed were responsible for the bombing in a plea for the public's help in identifying the suspected bombers. The pair, later identified as brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, tried to flee Boston that night, first killing a university police officer in a failed attempt to steal his gun and later engaging in a firefight with police in Watertown, Massachusetts that ended with older brother Tamerlan, 26, dead and younger brother Dzhokhar fleeing the scene.

Most of the Boston area was locked down for the following day while police searched for Dzhokhar, who was found hiding in a boat in a suburban back yard. Now 20 years old, the surviving brother is awaiting trial on charges, including the murder of four people and using a weapon of mass destruction.

Tsarnaev, a naturalized U.S. citizen, has pleaded not guilty to all charges and may face execution if convicted.

Entry into the Boston Marathon is a prized goal for many U.S. runners, who must meet strict age-graded qualifying times in other marathons to earn a spot at the starting line.

To accommodate an expected surge of interest, race organizers are introducing a staggered registration system, in which runners who have posted times at least 20 minutes faster than the normal qualifying time for their age group will be able to register on September 9, those who have beaten their minimum qualifying time by 10 minutes will enter on September 11, and those who have run marathons 5 minutes faster than their qualifying time can register on September 13.

After that, if spots remain, runners who have met their normal qualifying times will have an opportunity to register.

The stricter times could make for a faster-than-usual average field in the 2014 edition of one of America's most elite marathon events.



headline: Miami man pleads not guilty in Facebook confession murder case

A man accused of shooting his wife and then posting a photo of her lifeless body on Facebook pleaded not guilty at a court hearing in Miami where he was formally charged with second degree murder.

Derek Medina appeared Thursday in Miami circuit court three weeks after the death of his wife, Jennifer Alfonso. He was held without bond and could face a life sentence if convicted. Prosecutors may seek a first-degree murder charge when a grand jury meets next month.

Medina, 31, gained notoriety when he allegedly confessed in a Facebook posting that he had just shot and killed 26-year-old Alfonso in the kitchen of their South Miami townhouse because she was punching and physically abusing him. The posting was accompanied by a photo of her bloodied body on the floor.

Medina wrote to his "friends" on Facebook, "I'm going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife. Love you guys, Miss you guys ... My wife was punching me, and I am not going to stand any more with the abuse so I did what I did. I hope u understand me."

Miami-Dade Police Department confirmed the authenticity of Medina's Facebook posting.

Medina's arrest affidavit said that he confessed to shooting Alfonso multiple times after a dispute turned violent when she began kicking him and punching him. Alfonso had said she was leaving him, Medina said.

He also told police that Alfonso had armed herself with a knife during their argument, but he said that was after he had gone to his bedroom for a gun.

According to the affidavit, after Medina knew that Alfonso was dead, he changed his clothes and went to his parents, then turned himself in to police.

The author of six online books on topics that include marriage counseling, Medina had been employed on the front desk at a luxury Miami-area condominium. The couple married in 2010, divorced in early 2012, then remarried a few months later.

12:12am EDT

The United States said on Thursday it had transferred two men from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the government of Algeria as part of its ongoing effort to close the controversial prison.

The Pentagon said Nabil Said Hadjarab and Mutia Sadiq Ahmad Sayyab were transferred on Wednesday and arrived in Algeria the same day, leaving 164 detainees at Guantanamo, including 84 others cleared for release years ago.

The two Algerians were detained in Afghanistan more than a decade ago and sent to Guantanamo prison - Hadjarab on January 20, 2002, and Sayyab on February 15, 2002.

The Obama administration first announced plans to repatriate the two inmates last month, resuming the transfer of detainees for the first time in nearly a year.

The Pentagon said the decision to release the two men followed a comprehensive review by an interagency task force which looked at security issues and other factors.

Classified Defense Department files released by the anti-secrecy group Wikileaks said Hadjarab, 34, who was raised in Algeria and France, was believed to be a member of the al Qaeda Global Jihad Support Network with ties to the Algerian Armed Islamic Group.

He traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 where he received AK-47 training in Jalalabad. After the U.S.-led invasion, he fled to the Tora Bora mountains with other al Qaeda supporters. He was wounded by a U.S. helicopter while trying to flee Tora Bora and was later captured by Afghan troops, the U.S. documents said.

Sayyab, 37, also is considered to be a member of the Al Qaeda support network and is thought to have received training in making improvised explosive devices from the Moroccan Armed Islamic Group in Jalalabad, U.S. documents said.

After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States he traveled over the Tora Bora mountains trying to reach Pakistan. He was detained by Pakistani authorities and later handed over to U.S. forces, the documents said.

President Barack Obama has vowed to close the prison at Guantanamo, which has held dozens of prisoners, most without charge, for more than a decade. But the process has dragged on for years.

Obama promised to close the facility during his 2008 presidential campaign, citing its damage to the U.S. reputation around the world, but he has been unable to do so in 4-1/2 years in office, in part because of resistance from Congress.

"Closing Guantanamo remains a priority," said Lieutenant Colonel Todd Breasseale, a Pentagon spokesman. "For this reason, we continue to seek a lifting of the current restrictions that significantly limit our ability to transfer detainees out of Guantanamo, even those who have already been designated for transfer."

Breasseale said Wednesday's transfers were possible because the two men were among the few detainees going to a country that was not specifically barred by legislative restrictions and Algeria was willing to provide the security and humane treatment assurances required by the United States.

The Guantanamo prison camp was established during the presidency of George W. Bush to house foreign terrorism suspects after the September 11, 2001, attack on the United States.

A hunger strike and daily feeding of dozens of inmates through a tube inserted through the nose into the stomach has fueled calls to shut the detention center.

Last month lawmakers blasted the prison's cost, about $2.7 million per prisoner per year, compared with $70,000 per inmate at maximum-security federal prisons.

The last prisoner transferred out of Guantanamo was Omar Khadr, the youngest inmate and last Westerner held at the base. He was sent in September to finish his sentence in his native Canada.

foot trailer in the woods leading up to his trial in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin.

Shellie Zimmerman's comments were aired in an interview with ABC News a day after she pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of perjury for lying during her husband's Florida bond hearing last year.

Asked whether she wanted to remain married and have children with him, Shellie replied: "That's something I'm going to have to think about."

She also revealed she was not staying with her husband on the night Martin was killed in the central Florida town of Sanford because she walked out on him after an argument.

"I was staying at my father's house," she said. "We had gotten into an argument the night before and I left."

George Zimmerman was acquitted last month of murder for killing Martin, a 17-year-old, as he walked back to the townhouse where he was staying after buying snacks at a nearby convenience store.

Shellie Zimmerman declined to say whether she and her husband were currently living together.

Her husband did not attend a court hearing on Wednesday where she was sentenced to a year of probation, 100 hours of community service and ordered to write a letter of apology to the judge.

Shellie Zimmerman told a judge last year the couple was essentially destitute, even though they had accumulated $135,000 between them through contributions to an online legal defense fund, prosecutors said.

During George Zimmerman's trial, prosecutors presented some evidence of his state of mind but nothing about the unspecified argument and temporary split with his wife.

Prosecutors claimed he profiled Martin as potentially one of the thieves that had been breaking into neighborhood homes, then pursued Martin and shot him during a confrontation. Zimmerman claimed he shot Martin in self-defense.

Shellie Zimmerman said that while her husband was out on bond awaiting trial, the couple lived in hiding "pretty much like gypsies."

"We've lived in a 20-foot trailer in the woods, scared every night that someone was going to find us and it was going to be horrific," she said.

She also apologized to Martin's parents.

"I'm so deeply sorry for their loss. I can't even begin to understand the grief that a parent experiences when they lose a child," she said.

Detroit, which made the largest Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, on Thursday filed a request for proposals for $350 million in unprecedented financing, the city emergency manager's office said.

Detroit is the first large U.S. city to seek so-called debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing after asking for bankruptcy court protection.

The city plans to use about $250 million to terminate a complicated swaps deal related to previous bonds issued to finance pension debt, said Bill Nowling, press secretary for Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr.

mail to Reuters. It would be a line of credit the city could draw from, but it may not use all of it, he said.

Nowling also said Orr plans to use proceeds from the financing to invest in "quality of life" improvements for Detroit's nearly 700,000 residents.

In 1950 the city had 1.8 million people at a time when the three automakers that still call the Detroit area home dominated the auto industry. But in recent years the city that has accumulated more than $18 billion in debt and has made international headlines with its urban blight, roaming packs of feral dogs and outdated and sometimes inoperable police and fire equipment.

The termination of the swaps payment would be made to Merrill Lynch, a unit of Bank of America, said Nowling.

The state's emergency manager law grants to Orr most of the powers once afforded to the city's mayor and city council, including responsibility for the city's finances.

"The city is contacting a range of financial institutions, commercial banks, investment banks and hedge funds," Nowling said in an email to Reuters. He said the city would expect the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to approve the loan.

breaking case gets bogged down.

Detroit heads to a trial in October to prove it is eligible for bankruptcy. The city filed for Chapter 9 protection in mid-July.

On Wednesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy petition, cleared the way for the city to seek approval next month of the $250 million swaps deal that will give it unencumbered access to its casino revenues.

Detroit collects about $180 million annually from casinos, which is among the city's most stable sources of revenue.

In an interview with the Detroit News on Wednesday and published on Thursday, Orr said he wanted to use the casino tax revenue to back the borrowing. In the interview, Orr first publicly mentioned his intent to seek the funding.

Lending to a bankrupt entity might seem like a bad idea, but the loans are repaid ahead of almost all other creditors and Wall Street banks and hedge funds often provide a debtor-in-possession, or DIP, loans.

UNPRECEDENTED

But under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code, which covers the rare municipal bankruptcies, there is no real precedent for a DIP loan. As a result, there is no blueprint for determining the collateral the city can pledge, and how much power the judge has to enforce a lender's rights if Detroit defaults.

The only example of a municipal bankruptcy loan that turned up in a search of court records by Reuters was Prichard, an Alabama city with about 30,000 residents, which received court approval for a loan in 2000 during the first of its two recent bankruptcies.

The lack of precedent may make the loan a tough sale or may prompt lenders to demand control of the bank account receiving the casino revenue, lawyers told Reuters. DIP loans in corporate bankruptcies are often used to as a way to control a restructuring, and it was through a DIP loan that the U.S. Treasury guided the 2009 bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler.

Speculation about the need for such a loan has been a topic among lawyers and advisors who specialize in bankruptcy, and one lawyer told Reuters earlier this month he had been contacted by hedge funds about lending to Detroit.

"They see that it's a mess, and whenever there's a mess and they have a mop, someone will pay to clean it up," said Lewis Feldman, a lawyer who specializes in public finance at the law firm Goodwin Proctor.



headline: San Bernardino, California, gets bankruptcy protection

setting battle between bondholders and California's giant public pension system.

The case is being closely watched by other U.S. cities, including Detroit, which declared the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy last month, where budgets are burdened by soaring pension costs.

Judge Meredith Jury of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California ruled that San Bernardino was eligible for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection despite opposition by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers. The $260 billion pension fund is the city's biggest creditor and America's largest pension fund.

"I am ruling as a matter of law that the city is eligible," Jury said. "I don't think anyone in this courtroom seriously thought the city was anything but insolvent."

A city must be insolvent and have proof to have negotiated in good faith with creditors to be eligible for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy.

Michael Gearing, an attorney appearing for Calpers, called Jury's decision a "dangerous precedent" that will encourage other cities to "create a crisis because they have a large number of creditors."

Amy Norris, a Calpers spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement: "Calpers is considering its options for appeals."

San Bernardino, a city of 210,000 located 60 miles east of Los Angeles, filed for bankruptcy protection in August 2012, citing a $46 million deficit and arguing that it had effectively run out of cash to meet its daily obligations.

The city must negotiate with its creditors and produce a final bankruptcy plan on which the judge will ultimately have to rule. Whether pension and other debt payments, including to holders of $50 million in pension obligation bonds, will have to be treated equally or not will remain a key issue - one that could eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

LIKE OTHER CREDITORS?

Calpers argues that it should not be treated like other creditors and must be paid in full because California state law says the fund must always be fully paid, even in a bankruptcy. Bondholders argue that federal bankruptcy law trumps state statutes and say Calpers should be forced to fight with other creditors over how much they are paid under an exit plan.

Another California city, Stockton, which was also found eligible for municipal bankruptcy protection in April, is expected to present an exit plan in September. Creditors will be asked to vote on the plan.

The judge overseeing that case said dealing with Stockton's obligations to Calpers will probably be unavoidable under an exit plan.

In an unprecedented move, San Bernardino stopped paying its $1.2 million bimonthly employer payments to Calpers for a year after declaring bankruptcy, the first California city to halt payments to the fund.

It resumed paying Calpers last month but continues to renege on payments to other creditors, including holders of $50 million in pension obligation bonds.

Calpers said the city still owes the fund $14.3 million in arrears and that it will "aggressively pursue all past due contributions, resulting interest and penalties."

"These payments are statutorily required and necessary to deliver on the pension benefits promised to San Bernardino employees as a form of deferred compensation," the powerful pension system said.

But the judge questioned who will provide for those payments.

"If Calpers gets all the money they want, under what they say is their statutory right, who isn't going to get paid? All the employees? How is that going to help Calpers?" she said.

The case is In re San Bernardino, 12-bk-28006, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Riverside).



headline: U.S. teen accused in slaying of World War Two veteran says it was drug deal gone bad
byline: By Keith Coffman

old man tried "ripping him off" in a drug deal, court documents in the case said.

Kenan Adams-Kinard, 16, made the statement to friends as he was being sought in the beating death of Delbert "Shorty" Belton, according to an affidavit filed by a Spokane police detective in support of a criminal complaint against the suspect.

Adams-Kinard said he "was trying to buy an ounce of crack cocaine from 'Shorty' and 'Shorty' tried ripping him off," the affidavit said in paraphrasing an account related to police by an unidentified witness. Adams-Kinard said he then punched Belton and took his money back, the affidavit said.

Spokane police declined to comment to Reuters about the affidavit, but NBC News quoted a police spokesman as saying there was "no evidence to support" the allegation that Belton was dealing drugs.

Adams-Kinard and his accused accomplice, Demetrius Glenn, also 16, have been charged as adults with first-degree burglary and first-degree murder in Belton's slaying.

A friend, Natalie Flom, who had planned to meet Belton for a game of pool at a north Spokane fraternal lodge last Wednesday, found the U.S. Army veteran in his car in the parking lot with severe head and facial injuries.

Belton, who survived a gunshot wound to the leg during the Battle of Okinawa as Allied forces launched an assault on one of the home islands of Japan in 1945, died the day after he was found in the car.

The affidavit said police also seized a handwritten letter that Adams-Kinard allegedly wrote to his mother that likewise said the crime was a drug deal gone sour.

"I took his wallet and another ounce of crack from his pockets. He was unconscious, so I made sure he was still breathing, and then I took off," the affidavit quoted the letter as saying.

Flom dismissed as absurd the suggestion that her elderly, diminutive friend was a cocaine dealer.

Kinard's account, Flom told Reuters. "But it is so sick that anyone would try to pull his reputation down."

Security videotapes and photographs from the lodge and surrounding businesses led investigators to identify the teenagers as suspects, police said.

Glenn turned himself in the day after the attack, and Kinard-Adams was arrested four days later hiding out in the basement of a Spokane apartment building, police said.

Glenn was being held in lieu of $2 million bond, and Adams-Kinard's bail was set at $3 million, a higher figure because he was already established as a flight risk, according to a spokeswoman for the Spokane County prosecutor's office.

headline: Fort Hood shooter's death sentence heads for appeal with or without him
byline: By Joseph Ax
4:46am EDT

Major Nidal Hasan may wish to die a martyr, as he told mental health evaluators before his trial in the shooting deaths of 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, but his execution is likely years away.

The case against Hasan, who was convicted of the 2009 murders of 13 people at the Army base and sentenced to death on Wednesday by a military jury, will now move to a lengthy appeals process that includes several stages of review.

Appellate review is mandatory for courts-martial involving the death penalty, regardless of the defendant's wishes, according to Eugene Fidell, a professor at Yale University who studies military justice.

The case next goes to the "convening authority" - the high-ranking military officer responsible for calling the court-martial - for review. The officer can approve or reject the verdict or the sentence.

That step, which has no analogue in the civilian justice system, has drawn increasing scrutiny from Congress and military leaders concerned about sexual abuse after the controversial dismissal of a sexual assault conviction against an Air Force lieutenant in Italy earlier this year.

If the officer approves the Hasan jury's findings, the case will then move to the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals, an intermediate appellate court with military judges.

Hasan could refuse legal representation, as he did at trial, which would present an untested issue under military law.

Experts said the court will likely assign appellate Army lawyers to argue on Hasan's behalf even if he doesn't want to fight the sentence. During his trial, Hasan declined to call witnesses and admitted he killed the victims as part of what he said was a war between the United States and Muslims.

Military law states that appellate defense counsel "shall represent" a defendant when the United States is represented by counsel.

"I am confident that they will appoint lawyers for him," Fidell said. "They will file a brief whether he likes it or not."

ETHICAL QUESTIONS

But Tom Fleener, a defense lawyer who handles military cases, said that could present murky ethical issues.

"What do you do if the client wants to die?" he said. "You'd essentially be arguing against your client's interests."

If the sentence is upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeals, the next review takes place at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the military's highest court, which has five civilian judges.

Hasan or the government can petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review that court's ruling, though it is rare for the Supreme Court to do so.

Like any defendant - military or civilian - facing the death penalty, Hasan can also challenge his conviction in federal district court by filing a habeas corpus claim, typically on constitutional grounds, Fidell said.

The final step in the military appeals process for capital cases is presidential approval. By the time Hasan's case reaches that stage, it's likely that President Barack Obama will no longer be in office, said William Cassara, a defense lawyer who specializes in military cases.

Military executions are exceedingly rare with the last coming in 1961. In 2008, President George W. Bush approved the execution of Ronald Gray, an Army private convicted of multiple rapes and murders. Gray is appealing his case in federal court.

There are five military prisoners on death row, including Andrew Witt, an airman whose sentence was overturned two weeks ago by a military appeals court. He remains on death row while the government considers whether to appeal.

Not counting Witt's case, convening authorities and appeals courts have overturned 11 of the 16 death sentences given to military defendants since 1984, when the current system was put in place.

Because Hasan effectively failed to mount a defense at trial, however, finding grounds to appeal his sentence could be very difficult, Cassara said.

A military jury on Wednesday sentenced a U.S. Army psychiatrist to death for murdering 13 people in 2009 at Fort Hood, Texas, where he gunned down unarmed soldiers in what he later called retaliation for U.S. wars in the Muslim world.

Major Nidal Hasan shouted "Allahu Akbar" ("God is greatest" in Arabic) during the attack and later said he wanted to be a martyr. Now he faces death by lethal injection, pending an automatic appeal, for the rampage that also wounded 31 people.

The jury deliberated just over two hours before deciding on the death penalty for Hasan, who opened fire with a laser-sighted handgun in a medical facility at the sprawling central Texas military base just weeks before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan.

Bald with a thick beard, wearing Army fatigues and seated in a wheelchair, Hasan showed no expression as the president of the jury read aloud the sentence that he "be put to death." He is paralyzed from being shot by police upon his arrest on November 5, 2009.

Death sentences are rare in the military, which last executed a member of the service 52 years ago. Hasan, 42, will become the sixth man on death row at the U.S. military's prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

The same jury convicted him on Friday of 45 counts of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder.

"A weight has been lifted off my shoulders," said widow Joleen Cahill, who said she agreed with the sentence. Her husband, retired Chief Warrant Officer Michael Cahill, was among those killed. The other 12 were active duty soldiers.

Cahill's daughter Keely Vanacker added: "We are tired. We are hurt. We are resolved that justice has been served."

Gale Hunt, the mother of Specialist Jason Hunt, 22, also killed by Hasan, said she too was satisfied, although she added: "As a Christian, I can't say I wish death upon anyone."

An American-born Muslim, Hasan, who acted as his own attorney, said in his opening statement on August 6 that he was the gunman and had switched sides in what he considered to be a U.S. war on Islam.

He told mental health evaluators he wanted to become a martyr. Lawyers assisting him have said he was actively seeking the death penalty, although Hasan disputed that claim.

CRIES FOR HELP

In asking the jury to return a sentence of death prior to deliberations, prosecutor Colonel Michael Mulligan told the jurors: "Don't be fooled."

"He is not now and never will be a martyr. He is a criminal. He is a cold-blooded murderer," Mulligan said. "He is not giving his life. We are taking his life."

After Hasan learned he would be deployed to Afghanistan for six months, prosecutors said, he gave away his possessions and trained at a local shooting range.

Witnesses to the shooting said Hasan first sat among the soldiers who were waiting for immunizations and clearance at Fort Hood's medical processing center before deploying overseas.

He asked a civilian woman to leave and then opened fire, they said. Investigators recovered 146 shell casings.

Witnesses described a chaotic scene of people diving for cover, bloodied bodies and cries for help. Private Francheska Velez, 21, was heard screaming "my baby, my baby" in a futile plea to save her unborn child.

The pregnant private was one of three women killed in the shooting. The 13 killed ranged in age from 19 to 62.

Beyond his stunning admission in opening arguments, Hasan spoke little during his trial, turning down repeated opportunities to make a statement or present evidence.

Standby defense attorneys for Hasan attempted unsuccessfully to present so-called mitigating evidence to argue for a life sentence. Hasan objected, complaining he had "overzealous defense counsel."

Twenty family members and victims gave evidence during the sentencing phase, recounting heart wrenching stories about their loss, grief and struggles to rebuild their lives.

A young widow talked about her two suicide attempts, and a staff sergeant described his partial paralysis, brain damage and his debilitating anger and depression since he was shot.

The jury also sentenced Hasan to be dismissed from the military and to be stripped of all pay.

The death sentence means the start of an automatic and lengthy appeals process, typically a minimum of four years, according to military officials. A military execution requires the approval of the Fort Hood commanding general and the U.S. president in order to take place.

In addition, at least two military appellate courts will automatically review the case to determine whether the sentence was appropriate. Eugene Fidell, an expert in military justice at Yale University, said he expects Hasan will be assigned lawyers to argue his appeal regardless of whether he wishes to challenge the sentence.

The last person to be executed by the U.S. military was Army Private John Bennett, who was hung in 1961 for rape and attempted murder.



headline: After 24 years, San Francisco Bay area prepares for new bridge
byline: By Ronnie Cohen
12:12am EDT

era bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland was retired on Wednesday night, 24 years after it partially collapsed during a major earthquake.

But the big party once planned for next Tuesday, when a majestic $6 billion replacement bridge is scheduled to open, has been canceled - fitting for a project that was six years late, cost five times initial estimates and suffers from broken seismic safety bolts that some critics say render it unsafe.

Four California governors oversaw the planning of what will be the world's largest self-anchored suspension span. Two of them, Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, lobbied for a simple concrete viaduct. Bickering over everything from the exact location to whether or not to include a bicycle path (it does) delayed the project for years.

East Bay politicians including Governor Jerry Brown, who as Oakland's mayor at the time had pushed hard for a landmark structure that might move the workhorse Bay Bridge - second-busiest highway bridge in the country - out of the shadow of the glamorous Golden Gate.

They got one. With its single 525-foot (160-meter) white tower, the span rises up as a breathtaking sight. Eastbound motorists, who were caged on the lower deck of the old gray bridge, will now take in wide-open views of the bay and hills.

But the cracked fasteners discovered in March have sparked questions about whether the connector, which will carry up to 280,000 vehicles a day, could withstand the next big earthquake.

A temporary retrofit is supposed to take pressure off 32 fractured bolts, some as long as 25 feet, until a permanent fix can be installed on the 2.2-mile (3.5-km) span in December. But fears about the integrity of another 2,268 bolts linger, along with questions about the quality of Chinese steel used in construction and concerns about visible cracks in welds at the base of the tower.

For Abolhassan Astaneh, a professor of bridge engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, the cracked bolts are only one piece of what he sees as a fundamentally flawed project. He has been warning about the dangers of the self-anchored suspension bridge since designers first proposed it in 1998.

"It looks like this bridge was designed in the 16th century when no one knew anything about bridge engineering," he told Reuters. "This is going to go in the textbooks on how not to build a bridge."

Transportation officials went back and forth on whether to delay the opening after the broken bolts were discovered, but after the Federal Highway Administration signed off they decided to press ahead.

"The existing bridge is the one folks ought to be worried about," Steve Heminger, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission said at a news conference. "We've got two structures out there side by side. And there is no contest between which one is safer."

The old bridge closed at 8 p.m. Wednesday, and the new one is scheduled to open at 5 a.m. Tuesday, leaving Bay Area residents without an essential roadway link for five days.

QUAKE COLLAPSE

The 1989 earthquake shook loose a 50-foot (15-meter), 250-ton section of the eastern span's upper deck, which buckled and fell onto the lower deck. The collapse following the 6.9 quake killed one driver, shut down the essential connector for a month and exposed the fragility of the bridge, hailed by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1955 as one of the "seven modern wonders of the world."

Now it will be dismantled piece by piece at a cost of $300 million, nearly four times what it cost to build, said Randy Rentschler, a transportation commission spokesman.

Unlike the old bridge, the new span was built to sway along with an earthquake rather than to resist it. Investigative reports in the Sacramento Bee and the San Francisco Chronicle newspapers, however, called into question whether the new bridge would perform as designed.

Two engineering firms and the Federal Highway Administration examined the bolts and deemed the bridge safe. Engineers believe the fasteners cracked during manufacturing, during exposure to the bay's moist environment, or both.

But Berkeley's Astaneh and other engineers continued to warn about a possible catastrophe. He said he would take the train from his East Bay home to San Francisco and never drive on the bridge.

It is impossible to predict when the next major earthquake will strike the Bay Area and test the span, but area residents can predict the state of regional traffic with the Bay Bridge closed over the Labor Day weekend.

They are braced for gridlock.



headline: Obama says more work needed to achieve ideals from King's 'Dream' speech
byline: By Ian Simpson and Jeff Mason
12:12am EDT

The United States is struggling to realize the vision that civil rights leader Martin Luther King described in his famous "I Have a Dream" speech 50 years ago, President Barack Obama said on Wednesday, citing economic security as a still elusive goal.

Obama, the first black U.S. president, spoke to thousands of marchers on Washington's National Mall to commemorate King's landmark address, which came to symbolize the struggle for equality among blacks and whites in America.

Joined by members of the King family and two former presidents, Obama and his fellow speakers urged Americans to continue the slain leader's quest for justice.

Obama said King's speech inspired millions of Americans to fight for a more equal society and rights that people now take for granted.

"To dismiss the magnitude of this progress, to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed, that dishonors the courage, the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years," Obama said.

"But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete," he said, calling economic justice the "unfinished business" of the civil rights battle.

Marchers, many wearing T-shirts with King's face on them, began their walk near the U.S. Capitol.

They were led by a line of military veterans and people who had been at the 1963 march, their arms linked. People sang "We Shall Overcome" and other civil rights anthems.

Fighting restrictive voting rights laws that Democrats say hurt minorities, combating joblessness and reducing gun violence among African Americans are among the issues that civil rights leaders have put at the forefront of their efforts in 2013.

"This march was supposed to be about jobs, but it's about a lot more," said marcher Ash Mobley, 27, of Washington, who said she was there to represent her grandmother, who had been at the 1963 event.

The marchers heard speeches from former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and members of King's family on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the site of King's address on August 28, 1963.

A bell rang at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), 50 years to the minute after King ended his clarion call of the civil rights movement with the words "Let freedom ring."

King's speech is credited with helping spur passage of sweeping civil rights laws. A white prison escapee assassinated him in 1968.

King's elderly sister, Christine King Farris, said her brother's dream was alive, if unfulfilled.

"Yes they can slay the dreamer, but no, they cannot destroy his immortal dream," she said.

MORE TO DO

Bernice King, the slain leader's youngest child, urged the crowd to stay true to the ideals enunciated by her father.

"If freedom is going to ring in Libya, in Syria, in Egypt, in Florida, then we must reach across the table, feed each other and let freedom ring," she said.

Obama's address commemorating King, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and advocate of non-violence, came as the White House edges closer to launching military strikes in Syria in response to what U.S. officials say they believe was a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government on civilians.

Obama made no mention of Syria in his address.

The president, whose mother was white and whose father was black, has sometimes seemed reluctant to weigh in on persistent racial divides in the United States, but he spoke forcefully about the issue last month after the man who killed black Florida teenager Trayvon Martin was acquitted.

On Wednesday Obama said the 1960s civil rights movement led to greater freedoms for many different groups of U.S. society.

"Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed, and Congress changed, and, yes, eventually, the White House changed," he said to applause, a nod at his own historic election.

"Because they marched, America became more free and more fair - not just for African Americans, but for women and Latinos, Asians and Native Americans, for Catholics, Jews, and Muslims, for gays, for Americans with a disability," he said.

The "Let Freedom Ring and Call to Action" ceremony came as almost half of Americans say much more needs to be done before the color-blind society King envisioned is realized.

Wednesday's event capped a week-long celebration of King's historic call for racial and economic justice. They included a march on Saturday that drew thousands of people urging action on jobs, voting rights and gun violence.

Obama and Clinton also used their remarks to chide lawmakers in Washington for partisan battles that have prevented agreement on issues such as the budget and immigration reform.

"I would respectfully suggest that Martin Luther King did not live and die to hear his heirs whine about political gridlock," Clinton said. "It is time to stop complaining and put our shoulders against the stubborn gates holding the American people back."

headline: California wildfire heads deeper into Yosemite, entry road closed
byline: By Laila Kearney
12:12am EDT

Yosemite National Park, faced with the spread of a massive California wildfire, closed a second key route into the park on Wednesday that could keep some visitors from reaching one of the nation's top outdoor destinations over the Labor Day weekend.

The shutdown of Tioga Road comes as the so-called Rim Fire, which has now scorched an area larger than the land mass of Chicago, was burning deeper into the park and headed toward the tourist hub of Yosemite Valley.

The blaze, which stands as the sixth largest on record in state history, on Tuesday reached a reservoir that serves as the primary water supply for San Francisco, some 200 miles to the west.

Crews were attacking the eastern flank of the fire as it spread toward Yosemite Valley as well as the western edge, where some 4,500 homes in a string of small communities stood in the path of the flames, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Dennis Matheson said.

He said that treacherous, often inaccessible terrain was largely preventing firefighters from cutting new lines around the blaze and estimated it would take another week to fully contain it.

"I think it's very safe to say that we're looking at least at the first week of September," Matheson said. "A lot of it is footwork, creating containment lines by hand."

Of the 187,500 acres already blackened by the Rim Fire, more than 43,000 acres had burned inside Yosemite, up 3,000 from Tuesday, according to fire officials. Containment lines have been established around 23 percent of the fire's perimeter.

The flames last week forced the closure of a stretch of Highway 120 that leads to the west side of the 750,000-acre (300,000-hectare) park and is the main entrance from the San Francisco Bay area.

Tioga Road, the second of the four access routes into the park, was closed to allow fire crews to build containment lines along the road before the blaze approaches, said Yosemite spokesman Tom Medema.

"That will limit the access for visitors to and from the east side of the park, quite possibly over Labor Day weekend, which will have a significant economic impact on the area and (be) an inconvenience for visitors," he said.

Some 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, most of them during the peak months of June through August.

'ERRATIC FIRE BEHAVIOR'

The blaze, the biggest California wildfire since October 2007, is being fought by a force of some 4,100 personnel, backed by teams of bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters.

Firefighters plan to burn containment lines from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in the remote northwestern section of the park south to Tioga Road to stop the fire from moving further east into the park, Medema said.

By Wednesday afternoon, any remaining campers from the Yosemite Creek Campground and Tamarack Flat Campgrounds will be evacuated, he said. The park also closed the Crane Flat Campground.

The blaze has been among the fastest-moving of dozens of large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West that have strained national firefighting resources.

Cooler temperatures, higher humidity and calmer winds had been expected to help the firefighting effort Tuesday night, said Alison Hesterly, spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Later on Wednesday, temperatures were expected to be hot and dry, hitting a maximum of 94 Fahrenheit (34 Celsius) in the area with a minimum of 15 percent humidity, she said.

"If we reach the maximum temperature and the minimum humidity, we're expecting continued erratic fire behavior," she added.

After advancing on the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir for several days, flames got close to the artificial lake on Tuesday. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission said there was little risk to the reservoir because of the rocky terrain and lack of brush surrounding it.

Officials said ash had drifted onto the surface of the reservoir, but testing of samples showed water quality remained healthy. If the water should become fouled by too much ash and soot and require filtration, it can be diverted through a treatment plant near San Francisco before being delivered to customers, officials from the commission said.

Most of the homes in the path of the fire have been ordered evacuated or were under advisories urging residents to leave voluntarily or be ready to flee at a moment's notice. The fire has already destroyed dozens of homes and cabins, but no serious injuries have been reported.

The cause of the blaze remained under investigation.



headline: Murderer Jodi Arias requests new venue in Arizona sentencing retrial
byline: By David Schwartz

boyfriend, is seeking a change of venue for a sentencing phase retrial in her high profile murder case, saying she could not get a fair hearing in the Phoenix area, court documents showed on Wednesday.

The former waitress from California was convicted in May of killing her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander, who was found dead in his shower in a Phoenix suburb in 2008, shot in the face and stabbed multiple times with his throat slashed.

But the same Maricopa County jury that found Arias guilty of murder deadlocked on whether she should be executed or sentenced to life in prison following a sensational trial that captured attention in the United States with its tale of a soft-spoken young woman accused of such a brutal crime.

The deadlock forced the judge to declare a penalty phase mistrial, and prosecutors are seeking to impanel a new jury for a sentencing retrial to determine her fate.

Lawyers for Arias, 33, said in a motion filed on Tuesday that the extensive media attention to the case in Maricopa County made it impossible for her to get a fair trial there, and asked for a change of venue to another Arizona county.

The motion described the publicity surrounding the trial, which was live-streamed on the internet, as "highly inflammatory with Ms. Arias frequently being referred to as a stalker, a liar, crazy and a seductress."

"It would be hard to argue that this publicity at issue did not create a circus-like atmosphere," attorney Kirk Nurmi argued in the brief, saying that 70 percent of the media coverage took place in Maricopa County.

According to Arizona law, prosecutors have the option of retrying the sentencing phase of the trial with a new jury to determine if Arias should be sentenced to death. If that jury deadlocks, a judge would sentence Arias to life in prison, or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.

Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery will continue to seek the death penalty for Arias, a spokesman said on Friday.

The judge presiding over the case, Sherry Stephens, said at a hearing last month that she hoped to start jury selection in September. But on Monday, she delayed setting a date to impanel a jury, instead setting another status hearing in the case for the middle of next month.

The initial five-month murder trial, which began in January, was packed with graphic testimony, bloody photographs and sexual situations. Arias took the stand for 18 days and maintained throughout that the killing was in self-defense despite fierce cross-examination by prosecutors.

old student, whom the judge said seemed older than her age.

State District Judge G. Todd Baugh sentenced the teacher to 15 years in jail on Monday, then suspended all but 31 days of that term for the 2007 rape of Cherice Moralez, who killed herself in 2010, legal documents show. He also received credit for one day served.

In sentencing 54-year-old Stacey Rambold, the judge ignored a recommendation by prosecutors for a 20-year term with half of it suspended. Baugh described the girl as a troubled youth who "was probably as much in control of the situation" as was Rambold.

"We think the sentence is a travesty," said Marian Bradley, president of the state chapter of the National Organization for Women, adding that the group was seeking his resignation.

Referring to the judge, she added, "We think the man needs to be quiet before he endangers other women by suggesting they are to blame for being sexually assaulted."

The women's group expected hundreds of people to attend a silent protest near the judge's offices on Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, an online petition seeking Baugh's ouster had been signed by more than 13,000 people by Wednesday afternoon.

Baugh, who according to court transcripts also said before handing down the sentence that the girl seemed "older than her chronological age," did not immediately respond to several requests for comment.

Rambold was charged by Yellowstone County prosecutors in 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, the Montana equivalent of a rape charge, linked to Moralez, a student in a technology class he taught at Senior High School in Billings.

Moralez killed herself in 2010 before the case could go to trial. In an agreement with prosecutors later that year, Rambold admitted to a single count of sexual intercourse without consent and prosecutors agreed to postpone the case for three years and dismiss it entirely if Rambold completed sex offender treatment.

Prosecutors reinstated the case after being notified last year by the treatment center that Rambold, who was suspended in 2008 from his teaching post and later resigned, had been dismissed from the program for violating its rules.

In April, Rambold pleaded guilty to the rape charge stemming from the 2007 assault of Moralez in his Billings home, according to legal documents.

The girl's mother, Auliea Hanlon, had testified prior to sentencing that she wanted him put behind bars, saying she believed Rambold's actions were a "major factor" in her daughter's suicide.

"Cherice has paid for the consequences of his actions. He was on paid leave while she was being blamed and ostracized and ridiculed by her peers," she said. "He was as free as a bird while she was getting threatened and treated like trash every day."

Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito said he and his team of prosecutors were reviewing the sentencing - as they do in all such cases - with an eye toward any procedural or legal errors that might allow an appeal.

He said Hanlon, the girl's mother, was rightfully frustrated: "She is a victim in this as is her poor daughter, who is no longer with us."

Colombia extradited Diego Perez Henao, one of the country's most wanted gang leaders, to the United States on Wednesday to face charges for alleged cocaine trafficking and involvement in hundreds of murders, Colombia's prison authority said.

Henao, who goes by the alias Diego Rastrojo, was handed over to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials under tight security at a military airport in Bogota, the Colombian capital, and put on a U.S.-bound plane.

One of the heads of the Rastrojos criminal gang, Henao was captured in Venezuela in June 2012, then deported home to Colombia. A $5 million bounty was offered for his capture.

News pictures showed Henao being escorted to the plane by Colombian police, handcuffed and wearing a blue "Los Angeles" polo shirt.

Colombia's five main criminal gangs, which have around 3,800 members, were mostly formed after the disbanding of right-wing paramilitary groups in 2006.

Many of the paramilitary units morphed into criminal gangs supplying cocaine to cartels in Mexico and the United States, making the arrest of their leaders a top priority for Washington in its battle against drug trafficking.

Colombia is one of the world's top cocaine producers, making around 300 tons a year even after U.S.-backed efforts to stamp out the illegal trade. The country's leftist guerrillas, the FARC and the smaller ELN group, levy taxes on local production of coca but deny involvement in trafficking the drug.

The coca leaf is the raw material used to make cocaine.

The government has been in peace negotiations with the FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, since last November. Both the FARC and ELN, or National Liberation Army, are considered terrorist organizations by the United States and European Union.



headline: George Zimmerman's wife pleads guilty to perjury in Florida court
byline: By Barbara Liston
12:12am EDT

The wife of George Zimmerman pleaded guilty Wednesday morning to a reduced charge of perjury for lying in a 2012 Florida court proceeding concerning her husband's arrest in the killing of Trayvon Martin, according to court records.

Circuit Judge Marlene Alva in Sanford accepted a deal in which Shellie Zimmerman agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor perjury rather than the original charge of felony perjury in an official proceeding.

Zimmerman was ordered to serve one year of probation, perform 100 hours of community service and write a letter of apology to Judge Kenneth Lester, in whose court the perjury occurred.

George Zimmerman was acquitted in July of murder in Martin's death, but his wife still faced the perjury charge for telling Lester that they had no money at a bond hearing. At the time, the couple had accumulated $135,000 from donors to an online legal defense fund.

George Zimmerman was arrested last year after he shot Martin, who was walking to the townhouse where he was staying in the central Florida city of Sanford.

The case drew national attention to Florida's self-defense law, known as Stand Your Ground, while also sparking intense debate on racial profiling and equal justice for African-Americans.

The Zimmerman's family credit union accounts showed that Shellie Zimmerman had transferred more than $74,000 from her husband's account to her own during the five days before the bond hearing, an investigator with the state attorney's office wrote in an affidavit supporting her arrest.

The Zimmermans discussed the transfers in coded language in several phone calls recorded at the jail in the days preceding the bond hearing, the affidavit said. They also talked about moving money to Zimmerman's sister's account and about taking money from a safety deposit box, the affidavit said.



headline: Detroit can keep casino tax revenue, judge rules
byline: By Bernie Woodall and Joseph Lichterman
12:12am EDT

strapped Detroit can continue to access an estimated $11 million a month in casino tax revenue, a U.S. bankruptcy judge ruled on Wednesday, while the court takes up a deal with creditors related to the revenue.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy petition, ruled that bond insurer Syncora Guarantee Inc cannot block the city from using taxes paid by the city's three casinos.

Rhodes said Syncora does not have a lien on the money used as collateral since 2009 to secure Detroit's obligations on interest-rate swap agreements. Detroit entered into those agreements in conjunction with the sale of pension debt for its two retirement funds.

Sinking under more than $18 billion in debt and other obligations, Detroit on July 18 filed for the biggest Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Many bankruptcy experts believe the case may be a guide for what could happen when other U.S. cities file for Chapter 9 protection.

Detroit collects about $180 million annually from casinos, and around $15 million is deposited each month into accounts overseen by U.S. Bank to meet collateral requirements. The bank sets aside $4 million a month for quarterly payments to swap counterparties, leaving the city with about $11 million.

Syncora, which insured the swaps and some Detroit pension debt associated with the swaps, wanted to stop the city from accessing the casino revenue. That led Detroit to sue Syncora, claiming the insurer's action could derail an agreement in principle over the swaps. Rhodes put that lawsuit and other litigation on hold.

Detroit has asked Rhodes to approve a deal that could terminate the swaps, which were used to hedge interest-rate exposure on some of the pension debt, at a discounted rate of as much as 25 percent, saving the city more than $70 million. Monthly payments to swap counterparties from casino revenue would end if the swaps are terminated.

The deal, involving UBS AG and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, is the only one with creditors that has been publicly disclosed by Kevyn Orr, the state-appointed emergency manager running Detroit since March.

Syncora, other bond insurers, some owners of the pension debt, Detroit labor unions and others have filed various objections in court to the deal. The judge has ordered parties involved in the deal and many of the objectors to attend a mediation session scheduled for Thursday.

Ambac Assurance Corp, which insures about $170 million of Detroit general obligation bonds, said in its court filing the deal "cannot be deemed to be fair and equitable vis-à-vis the city's other creditors, because the city is overpaying one set of creditors at the expense of other similarly situated creditors."

In June, Orr determined the $1.4 billion of pension debt sold in 2005 and 2006 was unsecured and allowed a payment default, forcing Syncora to make a $24.7 million payment to bondholders. Orr, however, deemed the $300 million owed to swap counterparties was secured.

A hearing into the swaps agreement initially set for September 9 was pushed back on Wednesday by Rhodes to September 23 to allow attorneys for the multiple parties involved more time to prepare.

DIGITAL 'DATA ROOM'

Rhodes on Wednesday also allowed Detroit's legions of creditors access to critical financial data without having to agree not to disclose the information.

Some creditors, including a union representing city workers, had balked at being required to sign nondisclosure agreements in order to view 70,000 pages of financial information in a digital "data room."

Rhodes agreed to the city's plan to redact personal information such as Social Security numbers and home addresses from the documents. The data room would not be open to the public or news media.



headline: Zimmerman's wife 'stood by her man' in Florida perjury, lawyer says

George Zimmerman's wife, who pleaded guilty on Wednesday to perjury, was channeling hit country song "Stand by Your Man" when she lied to a Florida court about the couple's finances after Zimmerman's arrest for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, her lawyer said.

The lawyer, Kelly Sims, spoke to reporters after Shellie Zimmerman pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of perjury for lying in a bond hearing last year.

Shellie Zimmerman told the 2012 hearing the couple was essentially destitute, even though they had accumulated about $135,000 between them through contributions to an online legal defense fund, prosecutors said.

Circuit Judge Marlene Alva in Sanford accepted a deal in which Shellie Zimmerman agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor perjury rather than the original charge of felony perjury in an official proceeding.

She was ordered to serve one year of probation, perform 100 hours of community service and write a letter of apology to Judge Kenneth Lester, in whose court the perjury occurred.

Sims said Shellie Zimmerman was scared and caught off guard when she was asked in court about the couple's ability to make bond.

"So she stood by her man like Tammy Wynette," Sims said, referring to the singer's hit single "Stand by Your Man."

In her one-page apology to Judge Lester, Zimmerman acknowledged that she had lied in claiming that she and her husband were destitute.

"Over the last 16 months, I have become intimately aware of the justice system, and the absolute importance of all parties being truthful," she wrote in her letter to Lester.

George Zimmerman was acquitted in July of murder in Martin's death, but his wife still faced the perjury charge for telling Lester that they had no money at a bond hearing.

George Zimmerman was arrested last year, about six weeks after he shot Martin, who was walking to the townhouse where he was staying in the central Florida city of Sanford.

The case drew national attention to Florida's self-defense law, known as Stand Your Ground, while also sparking intense debate on racial profiling and equal justice for African-Americans.

The Zimmerman's family credit union accounts showed that Shellie Zimmerman had transferred more than $74,000 from her husband's account to her own during the five days before the bond hearing, an investigator with the state attorney's office wrote in an affidavit supporting her arrest.

Words from the first black U.S. president and bell ringing around the world on Wednesday will mark 50 years to the minute that civil rights leader Martin Luther King ended his landmark "I have a dream" speech.

Capping a week long celebration of King's historic call for racial and economic justice, President Barack Obama will speak at the Lincoln Memorial, site of King's address on August 28, 1963.

The "Let Freedom Ring and Call to Action" ceremony comes as almost half of Americans say much more needs to be done before the color-blind society King envisioned is realized.

Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton also will address the crowd at the ceremony, which includes bell-ringing at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), 50 years to the minute after King ended his clarion call of the civil rights movement with the words "let freedom ring."

About 50 U.S. communities or organizations have said they will ring bells. The Swiss city of Lutry and Tokyo are also taking part, said Atlanta's King Center, one of the event's organizers.

Other organizers include the National Action Network of civil rights leader Al Sharpton, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Council of Churches. The ceremony follows an interfaith service at Shiloh Baptist Church in Washington, organizers said.

Obama's address will wrap up more than a week of Washington events around the anniversary. They included a march on Saturday that drew thousands of people urging action on jobs, voting rights and gun violence.

King, a black clergyman and advocate of non-violence, was among six organizers of the 1963 "March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom," where he made his address.

King's speech is credited with helping spur passage of sweeping civil rights laws. A white prison escapee assassinated the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1968.



headline: Colorado has safest drivers; DC's most likely to crash -report
byline: By Karen Brooks
12:12am EDT

The best drivers in the United States live in northern Colorado, while motorists on the crowded roadways of Washington, D.C., are twice as likely to crash as the national average, according to Allstate America's Best Drivers Report released this week.

Drivers in the nation's capital get involved in crashes once every 4.8 years on average, compared with a national average of once per decade. The most dangerous cities to drive in after Washington are Baltimore; Providence; Hialeah, Florida and Glendale, California.

New York drivers have crashes on average once every 7.3 years, while those in Chicago and Houston crash once every 8 years.

By way of comparison, the average driver in Fort Collins, Colorado, crashes every 13.9 years. The next-safest cities were Boise, Idaho; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Brownsville, Texas and Madison, Wisconsin.

The report, released Tuesday, surveyed Allstate insurance claims over 2011 and 2012 in 200 of the United States' largest cities to determine how often drivers there have crashes.

The company uses the two-year time frame in each annual report to mitigate any spikes in the numbers due to weather events or similar unusual influences on the statistics.

Allstate drivers make up about 10 percent of all insured motorists nationwide, the report said.

The report draws distinctions between driving in big cities, where traffic, emergencies, public transportation and simply getting lost pose more dangers, and small-town driving, where high speed limits, fewer crosswalks and large vehicles are among the most common threats.

Indeed, almost all of the 20 cities with the safest drivers have less than half a million residents, the largest of them Tucson, Arizona, with 524,000 residents and crashes happening to drivers about once every 11.4 years - similar to Lincoln, Nebraska, which is about half the size.

Larger or more crowded cities landed on the bottom of the list. The 20 least safe cities for drivers include Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Newark and Miami.

Last month, Lance Batten was walking the trails around Berkeley Tuolumne Camp in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California, singing the familiar songs of his summertime refuge going back 26 years.

This week, the 62-year-old retired computer programmer sat in his Berkeley, California, home reflecting on the damage the monstrous fire inflicted in recent days when it destroyed a large swath of the timeless spot in the woods that Batten remembers so fondly.

He had taken his children to the camp when they were small and in July he brought his grandchildren.

"It's not just the memories. A piece of your life is wiped out and gone," Batten said in a telephone interview. "No matter what happens it will never be the same."

The so-called Rim Fire, which has burned nearly 184,500 acres, continues to push into Yosemite National Park while threatening 4,500 homes along its northwestern flank. As of Tuesday night, it was 20 percent contained.

In addition to ravaging the Berkeley Tuolumne Family Camp, it has also claimed at least one cabin in Camp Tawonga, a Jewish camp about 8 miles north inside the Stanislaus National Forest.

The structures of other nearby camps remain untouched by the blaze, the Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office spokesman, Sergeant Scott Johnson, said on Tuesday.

But at the Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, most of the buildings - which include 72 tent-top cabins and a communal dining hall - have been destroyed, said Berkeley city spokesman Matthai Chakko. The 91-year-old, heavily-wooded camp was a summertime refuge for families across northern California, and particularly for residents of Berkeley, who enjoyed priority in reserving space there, Chakko said.

The camp had been fully booked for the rest of the summer, Chakko noted, and its occupants were evacuated five days before the fire came.

Faring better but still not out of danger was Camp Tawonga, which caters to both secular and religious Jewish youth and has occupied its 160 acres since 1964.

The camp's primary season ended shortly before the fire, so only six staff members were forced to flee, taking with them the camp's decades-old Torah scroll - the Jewish holy text - which survived the Holocaust. Also evacuated was a tome dating to the 1980s in which campers recorded their summertime memories.

Camp Tawonga, most of whose buildings sit on a meadow that is more easily defended by firefighters than are woodlands, lost one cabin in the blaze. The extent of the damage to other parts of the camp, including its garden and arts-and-crafts area, is not known, said camp director Jamie Simon.

"We feel cautiously optimistic," Simon said in a telephone interview. "We're grateful to the firefighters for all the work they've done so far."

12:12am EDT

The city of Denver, in a first step toward regulating newly legal recreational marijuana, will ask voters to approve a 3.5 percent sales tax on pot sales in a citywide ballot measure in November, a city official said on Tuesday.

The municipal sales tax, if approved at the polls, would be on top of a proposed 25 percent sales and excise tax that voters statewide will also be asked to adopt in November to fund the regulation and enforcement of non-medical cannabis use.

"We are breaking new ground, and the country is watching us," Denver City Council President Mary Beth Susman said on Tuesday, the morning after the council voted 11-1 to approve placement of the city tax measure on the ballot.

Last fall, Colorado and Washington became the first U.S. states to legalize the possession and use of small amounts of pot for recreational purposes, and both states are still working out how to regulate the sale and marketing of the drug, which is classified as an illegal narcotic under federal law.

Nearly two dozen states also allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Susman said Denver officials have not received any input from the U.S. Department of Justice as it carries out the will of Colorado voters.

"I think the federal government is waiting to see how tightly we can regulate this," she said, adding that Denver lawmakers next month will take up specific proposed ordinances on the licensing of marijuana shops.

Under the Colorado law, local governments can opt out of allowing cannabis stores in their jurisdictions. More than 50 municipalities have banned retail pot shops while nearly two dozen have imposed moratoriums on the shops, according to figures from the Colorado Municipal League.

Last month, he state's second-largest city, Colorado Springs, barred retail pot shops, but its medical marijuana shops are unaffected.

Denver officials estimate the proposed sales tax would add $3.4 million annually to the city's coffers, which would go toward enforcement and public health programs.



headline: California governor proposes $315 million plan to ease prison overcrowding
byline: By Dan Whitcomb
12:12am EDT

California Governor Jerry Brown, facing a federal court order to ease overcrowding in the state's prison system, proposed a $315 million plan on Tuesday to expand inmate capacity by leasing space from county jails and other facilities.

The Democratic governor, who was joined by Republican leaders of the state legislature in announcing the bill, said his proposal would reduce California's prisons to 137.5 percent of capacity, as required by the court, and avoid the controversial early release of thousands of inmates.

He is seeking passage of the bill in the California legislature which would allocate funding.

"This legislation will protect public safety and give us time to work with public officials and interested parties to make thoughtful changes in the overall criminal justice system," Brown said in a written statement.

After years of litigation, a specially appointed panel of three appellate judges ruled in 2009 that California's prisons can exceed their design capacity but set a specific cap on the inmate population that would force the state to either find new homes for some 10,000 prisoners or let them go.

Frustrated with the slow pace of the state's response, the three judges have twice threatened Brown with contempt.

Earlier this month the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a petition for a stay of that order by state prison officials, who argued that they were working to meet the population target by December 31 but that doing so could be costly and pose a risk to public safety.

Though Brown's joint appearance with Republican leaders and Democratic Assembly Speaker John Perez suggested bipartisan support for his plan, Senate President pro tem Darrell Steinberg took immediate issue with the bill.

'NO PROMISE, NO HOPE'

"The governor's proposal is a plan with no promise and no hope. As the population of California grows, it's only a short matter of time until new prison cells overflow and the Court demands mass releases again," Steinberg said in a written statement.

"More money for more prison cells alone is not a durable solution; it is not a fiscally responsible solution; and it is not a safe solution," he said. "We must invest in a durable criminal justice strategy, which reduces both crime and prison overcrowding."

According to the governor's office, his plan would allocate $315 million for the state to "expeditiously" lease in-state and out-of-state prison capacity, including at county jails and private facilities.

Brown's proposal comes as new attention is being focused on California prisons during a hunger strike by inmates to protest conditions in special housing units where some prisoners are held for prolonged periods in isolation.

The protest is the third and largest hunger strike staged by inmates over solitary confinement in the last two years.

State officials deny the inmates' claims of inhumane conditions, saying that some prisoners have cell mates, are permitted visits and have access to a law library.

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation last week won a court order allowing them to force feed some of the prisoners taking part in the hunger strike, although officials said there was no immediate need to do so.

byline: By Paul Eckert and Eric M. Johnson
12:12am EDT

The United States will send its North Korean human rights envoy to Pyongyang this week to seek the release of an imprisoned and ailing U.S. Christian missionary, the State Department said on Tuesday.

Robert King, special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, will travel to Pyongyang on Friday at the invitation of the government on a "humanitarian mission focused on securing the release of U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae," the department said in a statement.

King will ask North Korea to "pardon Mr. Bae and grant him special amnesty on humanitarian grounds so that he can be reunited with his family and seek medical treatment," it added.

The White House urged North Korea on Tuesday to grant Bae, who suffers diabetes among other conditions, clemency and allow him to return to the United States.

Asked about his mission, King told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday that Bae had health problems.

"We're hopeful that we'll be able to make progress on that," he said.

King was visiting Tokyo ahead of his Pyongyang trip to meet with senior Japanese government officials and lawmakers including Keiji Furuya, minister in charge of issues related to the abductions of Japanese citizens by North Korea.

The release of Bae, which would remove an irritant in U.S. relations with North Korea, also would fit into a recent pattern of conciliatory steps by Pyongyang toward its neighbors.

In April, Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after North Korea's Supreme Court convicted him of state subversion. The court said Bae, 45, used his tourism business to form groups aimed at overthrowing the government.

Bae was detained in November as he led a tour group through the northern region of the country. His sentencing came amid acrimonious relations between Pyongyang and Washington over the reclusive state's nuclear program.

Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told Reuters on August 10 that her brother had been held at a prison for foreigners and put to work plowing and planting fields.

He was transferred to a state hospital because he suffered from a range of health problems, including an enlarged heart, chronic diabetes as well as back and leg pain, she said.

North Korea has used the release of high-profile American prisoners as a means of garnering prestige or recognition, rather than economic gain, by portraying visiting dignitaries as paying homage to the country and its leader.

That pattern has complicated the response from U.S. lawmakers and the State Department, which has called for Bae's immediate release on "humanitarian grounds," but had resisted sending high-profile envoys to negotiate.

Reports last month that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was set to visit North Korea to negotiate for Bae were denied.

In an Internet petition urging President Barack Obama to secure "special amnesty" for his father, Jonathan Bae wrote: "We have been distraught by my father's deteriorating health and his sentence of hard labor. However, we have not given up hope because we have faith in our government to represent and protect American citizens here and abroad."

King has experience negotiating in the reclusive state, which has sought to use imprisoned foreigners as high-profile bargaining chips.

Jun Young Su, an American citizen detained in North Korea on unspecified charges for six months, was released during a May 2011 visit by King to assess its pleas for food aid.

Jun was arrested and admitted committing a crime "against the state" following an investigation, North Korea's official KCNA news agency reported. Media reports said the California businessman had been doing missionary work in North Korea, which said he would be released on "humanitarian grounds."

Two American journalists arrested in 2009 by North Korea were held until former President Bill Clinton traveled there to negotiate their release.

"Many people will read too much into. What we've seen over the decades is that North Korea alternates between belligerent threats and even aggressive actions and charm offensives," said Bruce Klingner, a Senior Research Fellow for Northeast Asia at The Heritage Foundation.

In dispatching King, rather than a more prominent diplomat or former U.S. president, the State Department weighed the well-being of a citizen against gestures that might undermine its policy toward a bellicose state, Klingner said.

Earlier this year, North Korea threatened to stage nuclear attacks on the United States, among other military actions.

Rick Larsen, a U.S. congressman from Washington state, where Bae's family lives, has called for Bae's release.

"Kenneth's family has waited in anguish and uncertainty, but has never wavered in their tireless advocacy on his behalf," Larsen said in a statement.

member panel he appointed to review the privacy issues involved with U.S. government surveillance programs, the White House said, part of an effort to rebuild public trust after leaks by a former spy agency contractor.

Obama has faced criticism since Edward Snowden, a contractor for the National Security Agency, exposed classified information about U.S. surveillance of telephone calls and emails to journalists, raising concerns about privacy and civil liberties.

The review panel is part of an effort to expand oversight of the programs, which Obama has defended as necessary to protect national security.

Its members are Richard Clarke, a former counterterrorism adviser in the Clinton and Bush White Houses; Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA; Peter Swire, who worked on technology issues in the Obama and Clinton administrations; Geoffrey Stone, a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago, where Obama worked before entering politics; and Cass Sunstein, Obama's former regulatory czar who is married to Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

The group will present interim findings in 60 days to the director of national intelligence, the White House said. They are expected to give a final report and recommendations to Obama by the end of the year.

Earlier this month, Obama also said he would work with Congress to reform laws that govern the collection of phone records and add scrutiny to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

He also said he wanted to provide more information to the public about the surveillance programs to restore trust.



headline: Measles-like virus may be cause of dolphin deaths on U.S. coast
byline: By Environment Correspondent Deborah Zabarenko
4:46am EDT

like virus that suppresses the immune system could be the reason an extraordinary number of bottlenose dolphins have died after becoming stranded along the U.S. East Coast, a panel of dolphin experts said on Tuesday.

Since July 1, 333 bottlenose dolphins have been found dead along coastlines from New York to North Carolina, the highest number in a quarter-century and almost 10 times the average of 33 for the same period and region over the last five years, according to Teri Rowles of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Virginia has had the largest number of stranded dolphin deaths, with 174, Rowles said in a telephone briefing.

The death toll is likely higher because there have been reports of dolphin carcasses floating off the East Coast, particularly in Virginia.

Rowles and other experts from NOAA, universities and marine institutes have tentatively attributed the deaths to cetacean morbillivirus, which is related to the virus that causes measles in humans.

Morbillivirus attacks dolphins' immune systems, leaving infected animals thin and vulnerable to other diseases, including pneumonia. Many of the stranded dolphins have lesions on their skin, mouths, joints or lungs, NOAA reported.

Different kinds of morbillivirus stay within a closely related species and there is no indication this outbreak could jump to people, said Jerry Saliki of the University of Georgia.

This kind of dolphin die-off has not occurred in the mid-Atlantic region since 1987-1988. If this outbreak follows a similar course, it could last until May 2014 as dolphin populations build up resistance to the virus, Rowles said.

NOAA has declared an Unusual Mortality Event, which offers support for bottlenose dolphins in this area under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act.

NO DOLPHIN VACCINE

"At this point, there isn't anything to stop the virus," Rowles said. While there are vaccines against morbillivirus that occurs in land animals, there is no vaccine that could be easily deployed to populations of dolphins, she said.

This month, NOAA declared an Unusual Mortality Event for bottlenose dolphins in Florida's Indian River Lagoon, where dolphin strandings are nearly three times the historic average this year. The agency did not offer a tentative cause for these deaths, but many of the dolphin carcasses in Florida were emaciated.

"There is a tipping point in populations," Stephanie Venn-Watson of the National Marine Mammal Foundation said. "The primary hypothesis is East Coast dolphins don't have the natural immune response to fight off the virus."

Asked whether pollution could be a factor, Rowles said experts are monitoring an area off Georgia where there are high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in the water. PCBs were banned in the United States in 1979, but they can remain at manufacturing sites for decades and are known carcinogens, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

No stranded dolphins have been reported along the Georgia coast, but that could change as the dolphins migrate south for the winter.

A small Christian university in central Alabama was locked down for more than an hour on Tuesday, after an employee was shot by her husband on campus, university officials said.

The woman, a contract worker in the university's maintenance department, was taken to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries, Montgomery police said. Her condition was not immediately available, nor was her name or that of her husband.

Her husband was arrested after the lunchtime shooting, sparked by a domestic argument, said Dave Hogan, spokesman for Faulkner University in Montgomery, Alabama. The attack happened in a parking lot near the maintenance building, police said.

No students were involved, Hogan said.

The lockdown lasted just over an hour before campus activity resumed, Hogan said.

Faulkner University is affiliated with the Church of Christ. More than 3,500 students are enrolled in its four campuses across Alabama. Montgomery is the main campus.



headline: Zimmerman lawyer expects Florida to be stingy about legal costs

12:12am EDT

The attorney for George Zimmerman said Tuesday he expects to recover from the state no more than a fraction of the defense expenses, despite his client's acquittal in July on murder charges in the death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.

Attorney Mark O'Mara is planning to seek reimbursement from the state for defense costs estimated at $200,000 to $300,000, but expects to receive $50,000 or less because of limitations on what the state can approve.

"I just think it's patently unfair that the state by overcharging a case they could not prove at trial gets to cost either Mr. Zimmerman, or me, or the donors a whole bunch of money that they're not responsible for," O'Mara said at a news conference.

Prosecutors contended that Zimmerman profiled Martin who was walking to the townhouse where he was staying in the central Florida city of Sanford in February 2012. The former neighborhood watch volunteer shot Martin during a confrontation, and told police he acted in self-defense.

The case drew national attention to Florida's self-defense law, known as Stand Your Ground, while also sparking intense debate on racial profiling and equal justice for African-Americans.

The sum sought by O'Mara does not include his standard fee, which he said in this case would have totaled about $1 million for 16 months' work, or the fees of other lawyers on the defense team, all of whom worked for free. O'Mara said the state's Judicial Administrative Commission rules on reimbursement requests.

Some of the Zimmerman's defense expenses, particularly fees for expert witnesses, remain unpaid. Some defense costs and Zimmerman's living expenses were paid by donors who gave $314,000 as of January through a defense website.

frisk" policy backed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin deemed the crime-fighting tactic unconstitutional because it targeted racially defined groups.

She also ordered the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee several reforms, including a trial program for police to use body cameras.

Her remedies addressed lawsuits brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.

The city is appealing her decision to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

In a letter dated on Tuesday, it said her decision was "rife with errors of law" that could be corrected on appeal, where the remedies she ordered could be overturned.

"Implementation of the broad-sweeping panoply of remedies based on such errors are likely to cause irreparable harm to defendants and the public safety," city lawyers Heidi Grossman and Linda Donahue wrote in the letter.

The city added that implementing the body camera pilot project "poses significant harm in terms of time, resources and possible impingement on privacy rights of the public."

Bloomberg has defended stop-and-frisk, saying it has helped drastically reduce crime during his nearly 12-year tenure.

The cases are David Floyd et al v. The City of New York, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-1034; and Ligon v. The City of New York, in the same court, 12-2274.



headline: Miami Beach police sued by family of teen who died after tasing
byline: By Zachary Fagenson
12:12am EDT

old graffiti artist who died after being shocked by a stun gun during a police chase earlier this month sued the city of Miami Beach on Tuesday for damages, alleging use of excessive force.

Israel Hernandez-Llach died on August 6 after police shocked him with a Taser as he ran away from officers who caught him spray-painting the wall of a shuttered McDonald's.

The lawsuit filed on Tuesday in Miami-Dade County court alleges that Miami Beach Police Department officers allegedly used "unnecessary, excessive and unconstitutional force" including the use of a Taser on Hernandez Llach.

Noting that the young, Colombian-born artist was slightly built and not carrying a weapon "officers had no reasonable basis to fear for their own safety or the safety of the public," the suit asserted. It also said officers celebrated by high-fiving one another as the victim lay on the ground dead or dying.

As a result "emergency medical attention was withheld with reckless disregard for the life and safety" of Hernandez-Llach, according to the complaint.

"A Taser is a weapon, a weapon that inflicts excruciating, incapacitating pain on the subject. It carries with it a risk of serious injury and death," Todd McPharlin, an Hernandez-Llach family lawyer, told reporters.

He spoke on the steps of a county courthouse joined by members of the family wearing black and holding hands. Israel's mother, Jacqueline Llach, began crying after he started speaking.

The family is seeking undisclosed damages. Attorneys for the family say Hernandez-Llach would likely not have been prosecuted over the spray-painting and would have probably faced a punishment of community service for a second degree misdemeanor.

Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez, who is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, has said that Hernandez-Llach was confronted by officers after vandalizing private property and ignored their commands to stop running.

He said Jorge Mercado, the officer who shocked the young artist with the Taser, acted according to policy in dealing with someone who had resisted arrest.

Once in custody, Hernandez-Llach, who was known as "Reefa" and whose work had appeared in some Miami art galleries, showed signs of medical distress and was pronounced dead soon after, according to police statements.

A formal cause of death has not been established in the case pending toxicology results.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is conducting an independent review of the police investigation into the death.

Florida's state attorney and the medical examiner for Miami-Dade County are also reviewing the case, officials said.

The Hernandez-Llach family also accuse Martinez and the city of failing to properly train and discipline the police officers involved.

Miami Beach police have come under scrutiny in recent years for a series of shootings and improper conduct, including the death of a 22-year-old man who was shot 16 times by police two years ago during a Memorial Day weekend hip-hop festival.

duty fight in a men's room in 2007.

He was also accused along with three other officers of falsely arresting and tasing two New York tourists in their Miami Beach hotel room in 2008. That case was closed after the two alleged victims withdrew their complaint due to lack of witness testimony, according to police records.

headline: Boston mayor reaches deal for Caesars casino at horse racetrack
byline: By Daniel Lovering
12:12am EDT

Boston Mayor Thomas Menino reached a proposed deal with developers on Tuesday to build a $1 billion Caesars casino in the city's East Boston section that he said would generate at least $32 million in annual revenue for the city and create thousands of jobs.

The pact, expected since casinos were legalized in 2011, also includes an up-front payment of $33.4 million to East Boston and allows the Suffolk Downs horse racetrack, where the casino will be built, to continue to operate, the mayor said in a statement.

A referendum on the deal will be held within 60 to 90 days in East Boston, an outlying part of the city located across Boston Harbor past the city's airport.

"I have said from the start of this process that I wanted three things: a first-class, resort destination casino, an agreement that would benefit the people of East Boston, and a proposal that will be selected by the State Gaming Commission," said Menino, who is in the last year of a 20-year tenure as mayor. "We are well on our way to that and more."

Massachusetts legalized casino gambling in 2011. Lawmakers carved the state up into three districts, and allotted one casino license to each. Suffolk Downs, the only thoroughbred horse racing venue in New England, has been seen as the front-runner for the Boston-area license in a competition with rival Wynn Resorts, which has proposed a casino outside the city, in Everett.

About eight projects are vying for the three licenses, though none have yet won final approval.

The racetrack would join forces with casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp and build a Caesars-branded resort at Suffolk Downs that includes a casino, hotel, restaurants and retail outlets.

The deal provides for 4,000 permanent jobs, 2,500 construction jobs during the building of the facility, 2,225 jobs during an early opening period and 800 permanent jobs for a year before the early opening.

Under the deal, Boston would receive an estimated $52 million annually, with a guaranteed minimum of $32 million per year, Menino said.

Suffolk Downs has committed to spend $50 million annually on goods and services in Boston and $5 million in East Boston alone. It also would spend at least $45 million on roads, bridges, subway station improvements, bike lanes and ferry transportation.

The project would include two gaming areas, two luxury hotels with a total of 450 rooms, meeting and entertainment space, restaurants, retail space and a seven-story parking garage.



headline: Fort Hood gunman rests case without making statement
byline: By Ellen Wulfhorst
12:12am EDT

U.S. Army Major Nidal Hasan, facing the possibility of a death sentence for the November 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, rested his case without making a statement in the sentencing phase of his trial on Tuesday.

The jury of 13 military officers, who convicted the Army psychiatrist of killing 13 people and wounding 31 others, was instructed to return to court on Wednesday, when it will likely begin deliberating Hasan's sentence. Most of those killed and wounded were unarmed soldiers.

Given the opportunity to address the jury before the deliberations begin, Hasan declined to make any statement nor present any evidence in his defense.

"The defense rests," said Hasan, who has acted as his own attorney.

The most he has said in court was in his opening statement on August 6, when he admitted to being the gunman at the central Texas Army base and said he had switched sides in what he considered to be a U.S. war on Islam.

Standby defense attorneys for Hasan attempted to present so-called mitigating evidence that could be used to argue for a life sentence rather than the death penalty. That included details on his background, family life, education, military experience and logs of his behavior in jail.

"If no one makes a case for life, there is only death," said Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, one of the attorneys assigned to Hasan's case.

But Hasan objected to the effort on his behalf, telling Judge Colonel Tara Osborn he had "overzealous defense counsel."

The judge ruled in Hasan's favor, saying he should be allowed to control his side of the case.

"Major Hasan is the captain of his own ship," the judge said after repeatedly reminding Hasan that he could mount a stronger defense of his life.

"It is my free and voluntary decision," he told the judge at one point.

An American-born Muslim, Hasan earlier told mental health evaluators he wanted to become a martyr, and lawyers assisting him have said he was actively seeking the death penalty.

Hasan, 42, has disputed that claim.

The discussions about Hasan making little or no effort to argue for his life took place without the jury present.

Seated in a wheelchair, Hasan was bearded and wearing a camouflage Army uniform. He frequently rubbed his forehead and spent much of his time thumbing through court papers on the table in front of him.

He uses the wheelchair after being paralyzed when shot by police to end the rampage at the U.S. Army base, just weeks before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan.

The military jury convicted him on Friday of 45 counts of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder in what was the deadliest mass murder ever at a U.S. military base. The same jury can now sentence him to death or to life in prison.

Twenty family members and victims gave evidence during the prosecution's side of the sentencing phase. The prosecution concluded its case earlier on Tuesday.

Joleen Cahill, testified that she and her three children have struggled with emotional, health and work issues since the death of her husband, retired Chief Warrant Officer Michael Cahill, 62, an employee at Fort Hood. The couple had been married for 37 years.

One night, the widow said, she found herself having a thought that she described as one "you shouldn't have," without elaborating, and realized: "I need to start fighting back."

"The shooting is not going to destroy my life or my children's. He is not going to win. I am in control," she said.

If the jury unanimously recommends death as his punishment, Hasan could face lethal injection, possibly making him the first U.S. soldier to be executed by the U.S. military since 1961.

A death sentence would mean the start of a lengthy process requiring the approval of the Fort Hood commanding general, and the U.S. president, in order for there to be an execution.



headline: California wildfire burns deeper into Yosemite National Park
byline: By Laila Kearney
12:12am EDT

summer visitors, while the sprawling blaze also crept closer to thousands of homes west of the park.

The so-called Rim Fire, which has burned for 11 days mainly in the Stanislaus National Forest west of Yosemite, nearly doubled its footprint in the park overnight after encroaching on a reservoir that serves as the primary water supply for San Francisco some 200 miles to the west.

Officials said some ash from the fire had drifted onto the surface of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, but testing of samples taken from the artificial lake showed that water quality remained healthy.

If the water should become fouled by too much ash and soot and require filtration, it can be diverted through a treatment plant near San Francisco before being delivered to customers, officials from the city Public Utilities Commission said.

Meanwhile, a firefighting force of some 3,700 personnel, backed by teams of bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters, continued to make headway in their drive to encircle and suppress the flames.

By late on Monday, containment lines had been established around 20 percent of the fire's perimeter, nearly triple Sunday's figure, though the overall area of the blaze continued to grow as much of the firefighting effort focused on structure protection.

"We are making progress," Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said on Tuesday, adding that fire managers were looking forward to a cooling trend forecast for the end of the week. "That would bring some much-needed relief," he said.

The blaze was among the fastest-moving of dozens of large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West.

More favorable weather this week in the Pacific Northwest, including lower temperatures, diminished winds and even some rain, has helped firefighters gain an upper hand on a number of stubborn blazes in Oregon and Washington state.

Those gains have, in turn, freed up some fire crews and other thinly stretched resources, leading federal fire managers to lower the nation's wildfire threat index a notch.

"Things are really getting rosier," said Ken Frederick, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center, a support center for wildland firefighting, in Boise.

BUFFER ZONES AROUND HOMES

The Rim Fire has charred nearly 180,000 acres - an area larger than the land mass of Chicago - since it erupted August 17, most of that in the Stanislaus Forest, Berlant said.

It ranks as the biggest California wildfire since October 2007, when the Witch Fire torched nearly 198,000 acres and more than 1,600 structures in San Diego County, and the sixth-largest in state history, according to the records of Cal Fire, a state government site.

Firefighters hacking through dense, dry brush and trees to create clearings in the rugged terrain rushed on Tuesday to improve buffer zones around some 4,500 homes threatened by the blaze on its northwestern flank, Berlant said.

Most of those dwellings have been ordered evacuated or were under advisories urging residents to leave voluntarily or be ready to flee at a moment's notice. The fire has already destroyed dozens of homes and cabins, Berlant said, but no serious injuries have been reported.

As of Tuesday morning, the blaze had scorched nearly 42,000 acres of Yosemite - almost double the number from late Monday, forcing the closure of some campgrounds in the more remote northern part of the park and the main entrance road from the San Francisco Bay area. (<a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>)

The vast majority of the 1,200-square-mile park, including the Yosemite Valley area renowned for its towering rock formations, waterfalls, meadows and pine forests, remained open to the public and free of smoke. But late-summer crowds were notably diminished, park officials said.

"There are still people here, but there's definitely fewer visiting than there normally would be for this time of year, and that just happened within the last couple of days," park spokeswoman Kari Cobb told Reuters. "It's just the northern part of the park is smoky."

The Rim Fire, named for a Stanislaus National Forest lookout point called Rim of the World, has already damaged two of the three hydropower generating stations, linked to the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, that supply electricity for all of San Francisco's public facilities, such as hospitals and firehouses.

The city has been drawing on reserve power stored for emergencies and purchasing additional electricity on the open market to make up for the difference.

The fire also ravaged a 91-year-old summer camp operated by the Bay-area city of Berkeley - the Tuolumne Berkeley Family Camp - west of the Yosemite on Sunday, days after a nearby Jewish camp called Camp Tawonga was damaged.

The cause of the blaze remained under investigation.



headline: Denver seeks 3.5 percent tax on sales of marijuana
byline: By Keith Coffman
12:12am EDT

The city of Denver, in a first step toward regulating newly legal recreational marijuana, will ask voters to approve a 3.5 percent sales tax on pot sales in a citywide ballot measure in November, a city official said on Tuesday.

The municipal sales tax, if approved at the polls, would be on top of a proposed 25 percent sales and excise tax that voters statewide will also be asked to adopt in November to fund the regulation and enforcement of non-medical cannabis use.

"We are breaking new ground, and the country is watching us," Denver City Council President Mary Beth Susman said on Tuesday, the morning after the council voted 11-1 to approve placement of the city tax measure on the ballot.

Last fall, Colorado and Washington became the first U.S. states to legalize the possession and use of small amounts of pot for recreational purposes, and both states are still working out how to regulate the sale and marketing of the drug, which is classified as an illegal narcotic under federal law.

Nearly two dozen states also allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Susman said Denver officials have not received any input from the U.S. Department of Justice as it carries out the will of Colorado voters.

"I think the federal government is waiting to see how tightly we can regulate this," she said, adding that Denver lawmakers next month will take up specific proposed ordinances on the licensing of marijuana shops.

Under the Colorado law, local governments can opt out of allowing cannabis stores in their jurisdictions. More than 50 municipalities have banned retail pot shops while nearly two dozen have imposed moratoriums on the shops, according to figures from the Colorado Municipal League.

Last month, he state's second-largest city, Colorado Springs, barred retail pot shops, but its medical marijuana shops are unaffected.

Denver officials estimate the proposed sales tax would add $3.4 million annually to the city's coffers, which would go toward enforcement and public health programs.

headline: Judge speeds hearing on Detroit bankruptcy eligibility
byline: By Joseph Lichterman
12:12am EDT

The federal judge overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy filing is accelerating the already hurried process of determining whether the city is eligible for protection from its creditors.

Judge Steven Rhodes ordered late Monday that initial oral arguments in the case begin on September 18, well ahead of the October 23 date he originally scheduled for the start of the trial on the issue of eligibility.

Detroit filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history on July 18. Kevyn Orr, Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, has said he wants the city to be out of bankruptcy court by the time his term as emergency manager is scheduled to end in the fall of 2014.

Monday's order was the latest sign that Rhodes wants to set an aggressive timetable to move the city through bankruptcy court.

"A prompt oral argument on these legal issues will promote just, speedy and efficient determination of the city's eligibility to be a debtor" under the bankruptcy code, Rhodes wrote on Monday.

Rhodes also said he would delay hearing objections to the bankruptcy that center on potential cuts to retiree pensions, which unions and retiree groups argue are protected by the Michigan state constitution.

The judge wrote in his order that he "appreciates the extraordinary importance of the pension rights," but he will not consider arguments about potential cuts to pensions until after he decides whether the city is eligible for bankruptcy.

The eligibility argument will center on whether Detroit is insolvent, whether the city negotiated in good faith with its creditors, or whether there were too many creditors to make negotiations feasible.

The bankruptcy code requires only that Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, prove that the city is insolvent, Rhodes wrote, adding that the city does not need to "prove that any particular plan that it might later propose is confirmable."

Bill Nowling, Orr's spokesman, said Tuesday that delaying a decision on the pension funds until the city has filed a restructuring plan with the court was appropriate.

"We think the judge is absolutely right to say that that's a plan of adjustment issue and should be litigated during that phase of the proceedings."

Laura Bartell, a law professor and bankruptcy expert at Wayne State University in Detroit, said the judge's decision to postpone discussion of the pension issues was "logical."

In a June 14 report to the city's creditors, Orr said unsecured creditors, including pension funds, will receive a pro rata share of $2 billion of notes the city would issue and pay off as its financial circumstances improve.

City workers and retirees would also face changes to their pensions and health care coverage "consistent with available funding," Orr said at the time, which was before the city filed for bankruptcy.

Creditors filed 109 objections to the city's bankruptcy before the deadline last week. In their objections, unions and the city's two public pension funds made similar arguments, claiming a bankruptcy filing will lead to an unconstitutional reduction in retirement benefits.

The September 18 hearing will be used to hear arguments on legal issues in the case raised by city labor unions and others, including the constitutionality of Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy and of the Michigan law that allowed the city to file for bankruptcy.

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 25, in its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Detroit, argued that Chapter 9 encroaches on states' rights.

AFSCME, as well as the United Auto Workers and the city's two retirement systems, also claimed that the state law Gov. Rick Snyder used to appoint Orr violated the state constitution.

AFSCME's Ed McNeil, the chief negotiator for a coalition of 33 unions that represent most of the service workers for the city, said in a statement that the union is concerned about the hasty schedule.

McNeil added that "the order does not prohibit us from making constitutional arguments or arguments about the pensions at the September 18 hearing."

Arguments objecting to the underlying facts in the case, such as whether the city negotiated with creditors in good faith, will be heard on October 23, as originally planned.

AFSCME and the organizations representing retired Detroit police officers and firefighters also argued that Detroit has not proven it is insolvent and has not negotiated in good faith with its creditors.



headline: Four thousand run from the bulls in Virginia event
byline: By Gary Robertson
12:12am EDT

mile dirt track on Saturday in rural Virginia's version of the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain.

It was the first event of what promoters say will be a nationwide, 10-city bull-running tour modeled on the annual Pamplona event.

"I just didn't want to die, to get trampled by bulls and die," said Cat Brown, 22, who works in engineering and traveled from New York City for the run.

"It was a rush ... a shot of adrenalin," she said.

Brown had such a thrill dodging bulls and watching them race by at break-neck speed that she paid $30 to run again in the afternoon.

The first six runs were conducted with about 500 runners each, chased by 12 bulls, and the last run featured 24 bulls chasing about 700 runners.

About 8,000 people came to watch the runs, said Rob Dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of the Boston-based Great Bull Run. Most of those who signed up were 18 to 40 years old, and about 40 percent were women.

At least one runner suffered an injury that required a trip to a hospital. Another went to see a medic after being knocked down and stepped on by other runners.

Every participant in the race had to sign a waiver, absolving the organizers of liability should they be injured.

Dickens said it was "doing something dangerous and living to tell the tale" that draws participants to the event.

That was what drew Laurie Blaha, 27, of Richmond, Virginia. "I wanted to test myself," she said.

Blaha said she passed the test, conquering the fear and nervousness she had before the bulls ran onto the track.

"It was exhilarating," Blaha said. "I would definitely do it again."

Dickens said the only major problem came on the first run of the day, when the initial group of six bulls stopped about midway down the quarter-mile dirt course.

They didn't start running again until six additional bulls were let out of the gates. Dickens said they apparently didn't have the confidence to run alone, and needed more company.

After that, he said the staff overseeing the bulls began sending 12 bulls at a time.

In nearly all the runs held during the day, the bulls started slowly and then quickly accelerated to a stampede-like pace.

The Virginia run was set on the grounds of the Virginia Motorsport Park, a drag strip south of Richmond that offered spectators State Fair food such as fried Oreos and foot-long corn dogs.

Animals rights groups, such as PETA, have protested the Great Bull Run, saying the events puts stress on the animals.

Dickens has said the bulls are not harmed and has invited anyone observing someone abusing the animals to report it.

The next Great Bull Run is scheduled for October 19 in Atlanta. Other cities on the nationwide tour include Houston, Tampa and Los Angeles.



headline: Maine 'hermit' pleads not guilty to stealing to support himself
byline: By Dave Sherwood
12:12am EDT

A Maine man who lived in the woods with nearly no human contact for 27 years, supporting himself by stealing food and supplies, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to seven counts of burglary and six of theft.

Christopher Knight, 47, was clean-shaven with closely cropped hair and looked well fed at the time of his arrest in April. He has grown a full beard in his four months in prison and now looks gaunt.

Since his capture, he has been the subject of a documentary, countless media stories, received marriage proposals and a "no-strings-attached" offer by a stranger to pay his bail.

Wearing baggy green prison clothes as he sat in a courthouse just 20 miles east of his long-time woodland hideout, Knight appeared unfazed by the bustle of reporters and television cameras.

He answered "not guilty" to each of the counts but otherwise did not address the court.

Justice Michaela Murphy set Knight's trial for October 8. Prosecution and defense attorneys said they were confident they would be able to reach a plea deal that would avoid trial.

"We're trying to come to an agreement that includes both the punishment angle and rehabilitation," said Kennebec County District Attorney Maeghan Maloney, adding that Knight was found competent to stand trial.

Police contend Knight committed as many as 1,000 burglaries in order to survive. The list of stolen items runs the gamut from flashlights, electrical tape and propane to video games and marshmallows.

Authorities initially said Knight confessed to many of the burglaries. His attorney Walter McKee said Knight pleaded "not guilty" because of technicalities involved with the confession.

He noted Knight said he had "always 100 percent completely accepted responsibility for what he did," and called the situation "awkward."

Knight has offered little explanation for why he walked away from his home in 1986 and began a life with almost no human contact. He was arrested in April after police said they caught him stealing food and supplies from a summer camp for the disabled.

At the time he was arrested, authorities said everything but his eyeglasses, the same pair he wore in a photo taken of him shortly before he disappeared, was stolen.

Knight's camp, well-appointed with a tent, sleeping bags and cookstove, was hidden amongst boulders and crevices on a hillside of evergreens just a few hundred yards from the nearest house.

The judge confirmed bail at $25,000, but prohibited third parties from offering it, making it unlikely Knight, who has no possessions, would post it.

"There are those who don't think he should be prosecuted at all. Others think he should be in prison for the rest of his life," said Maloney. "But no one wants him to return to the life he was living before unless he can do so legally."

headline: Entergy to shut controversial Vermont nuclear plant

12:12am EDT

Entergy Corp will shut the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, citing high costs tied to regulation and competition from cheap natural gas, bringing to an end a long battle with politicians and environmentalists seeking to close it.

Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin welcomed the news that the 40-year-old plant, which generates three-quarters of the state's power, will cease operations by the end of 2014, though the closure raises new problems for the New England state, including how long it would take to clean up the site.

Entergy's move came just two weeks after a federal appeals court largely sided with the company in its fight to prevent Vermont from shutting down the only nuclear power plant in the state and one of four in New England.

Opposition to the Vernon, Vermont, plant has grown over the years, most recently focusing on a January 2010 disclosure of a leak of radioactive tritium. Still, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted the plant a 20-year operating license in 2011 that would have kept it running until March 2032.

But Leo Denault, Entergy's chief executive since February, said in an interview with Reuters that the plant was no longer economically viable due to a combination of rising capital costs after the September 11 attacks, Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster and low wholesale electricity prices stemming from cheap natural gas burned by competing plants.

"We did everything we could to keep the plant open," he said, praising the 600 employees for operating the plant even when "they did not feel welcome in the state."

Opponents of the plant were quick to voice their approval.

"This is not a big surprise to me and I don't think it's a big surprise to many who follow the economics of aging nuclear power plants," Shumlin, Vermont's Democratic Governor who led the state's fight to have the plant shut down when its initial operating permit expired in 2012, told reporters.

Marvin Fertel, chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Institute said in a statement that the shut down was "a great loss to the state of Vermont, the regional economy and consumers, and the environment."

REGULATION, COMPETITION

The Fukushima meltdowns and radioactive contamination led regulators to review safety standards, which could lead to requirements for costly plant improvements, a decade after 9/11 prompted heavy spending to tighten security around plants.

Surging output of shale gas, which sent natural gas prices to 10-year lows in 2012, has also weighed on the nuclear industry. Last October, Dominion Resources Inc's Kewaunee plant in Wisconsin became the first nuclear plant to be closed due to cheap gas prices after hundreds of coal-fired plants had shut.

Natural gas-fired plants now account for more than half New England's energy supply, according to the region's grid operator.

With Vermont Yankee, a total of five U.S. nuclear plants have shut or will shut before their licenses expire.

Denault said Entergy is open to a settlement with New York State officials over the future of its controversial Indian Point nuclear plant, which is near New York City.

Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a local advocacy group which has been lobbying for Yankee's closure since the 1970s, said it felt vindicated by Entergy's decision.

"It represented a risk would could not afford for power we don't need," VPIRG Executive Director Paul Burns said in a statement.

Vermont's total energy consumption is the lowest in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In 2011, three-quarters of its power generation came from nuclear power, with another 21 percent from hydroelectric power.

Closure of the plant will probably not have a large impact on natural gas markets, Thomson Reuters analyst Reza Haidari said, estimating it would boost U.S. natural gas consumption by less than 0.01 percent.

Entergy said it will take an after-tax impairment charge of about $181 million in the third quarter due to the retirement of the plant, the smallest that it owns, and expects further charges of $55 million to $60 million related to future severance and other costs through the end of next year.

The New Orleans-based company said the shutdown would modestly benefit its operational earnings, excluding special items, within two years, with cash flow expected to increase about $150 million to $200 million through 2017.

Shares of the U.S. power company were little changed, down 26 cents to $62.81 per share on the New York Stock Exchange.

LONG CLEANUP AHEAD

Entergy's decision to close the plant leaves Vermont with the question of what to do with the site, located in the rural state's southeast corner, near New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

It could be some time before the site is available for other uses, warned energy specialist Christopher Russo of Charles River Associates in Boston.

"It's probably on the order of 50 years before it goes back to being a green field site," Russo said. "There's nowhere to move the nuclear fuel at this point."

That said, he noted, one of the greatest assets in a decommissioned nuclear power plant is its connection to the electrical grid, which could make the site attractive to a utility looking to install another style of generator.

"The grids were almost built around these plants," Russo said.

While Vermont officials have long fought to close the plant, area residents had an uneasy peace with it.

Fana Cyr, a 37-year-old builder from Hinsdale, New Hampshire, across the Connecticut River from the plant, said he was glad it was being shut down.

"I figure it will be safer, I've heard they had some problems with it," Cyr said. "Hopefully they clean up the mess."

Cyr discussed the plant as he fished in the waters of the same river that plays a role in the plant's cooling systems.

"We do fish here," he said. "I don't do much swimming here. And we definitely don't eat the fish."

headline: Couples challenge Nebraska ban on gay adoptive and foster parents
byline: By Brendan O'Brien
12:12am EDT

Gay and lesbian couples in Nebraska should be allowed to serve as foster or adoptive parents to children who are in state custody, according to a state court lawsuit filed on Tuesday.

A lesbian couple and two gay couples filed the lawsuit in a Lincoln district court arguing the state policy created in 1995 banning them from becoming foster or adoptive parents to children under care of Nebraska is unconstitutional.

The lawsuit comes two months after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred same-sex couples from federal marriage benefits.

The ruling has led to a wave of legal challenges in federal and state courts to laws that restrict the rights of gays and lesbians.

Nebraska's policy prohibits the state's department of health and human services from issuing foster-home licenses to or placing children with people who identify themselves as homosexuals or to people who are unrelated, unmarried adults living together.

According to Leslie Cooper, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the couples in Nebraska, the state, through the screening process, has made multiple exceptions for unrelated, unmarried adults who live together, but not for gay and lesbian couples.

"There should be individual screenings subjected to the same standards for everybody that applies," she said.

The lawsuit contends the policy is unconstitutional because it treat gays and lesbians differently than heterosexuals, violates their personal liberties and subjects them to prejudice based on sexual orientation.

Given Nebraska's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, the provision that excludes unrelated, unmarried adults from being adoptive and foster-care parents inherently applies to gay and lesbian couples, Cooper noted.

A lesbian couple in Michigan is challenging that state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and the state law that prevents them from jointly adopting each other's children.

State courts in Nebraska as well as Kentucky, North Carolina and Ohio have ruled that so-called second-parent adoptions are not available under current law. Second-parent adoption is the adoption of a child by a second parent in the home who is not married to the child's legal parent.

Nebraska is joined by Utah and Mississippi as states having the most restrictive adoption and foster-care policies, according to Cooper.

Utah, where gay marriage is not allowed, bans all unmarried individuals in cohabiting relationships from being adoptive or foster-care parents, while Mississippi only bans same-gender couples from those roles, she said.



headline: Eight months after massacre, Newtown begins new school year

The Connecticut town that was the site of a shooting rampage that left 20 elementary school students and six faculty and staff dead last December, appeared largely the same on Tuesday as it did a year ago.

But as students from Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School began their first full academic year at their temporary quarters in the former Chalk Hill school in nearby Monroe, residents said they feel that life had changed.

"It's like after 9/11. The world looks different. It is different," said Kris Mauro, 46, a Newtown resident. "Everybody looks the same, everybody's just as nice. But it's a different world."

Mauro said her chief frustration is that she had hoped "we'd get rid of all the guns," but that gun-rights groups have instead been emboldened since the shooting.

Last December 14, Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old who had grown up in Newtown, shot and killed his mother before shooting his way into the Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he killed 26 people before turning a gun on himself. The sheer youth of Lanza's victims, mostly 6- and 7-year-olds, stunned the country.

The massacre inspired a package of national gun control measures in Congress as well as calls for better security in schools, including the presence of armed guards.

The bills, which included a national ban on assault weapons and expanding the use of background checks for gun purchases, were ultimately rejected after U.S. lawmakers decided they would have interfered with Americans' constitutional right to bear arms.

Several U.S. states - including Connecticut, New York and New Jersey -have passed laws tightening gun ownership requirements since the attack. Other states have expanded gun rights.

But in Newtown on Tuesday, the gun debate was secondary to hopes that kids here could have a normal school year.

"You don't forget, but you have to go forward," said Rose Scotti, 60, as she loaded groceries at a local store.

Around Newtown, a leafy and bucolic town, most of the informal memorials that once dotted the landscape here have been dismantled.

Near the Sandy Hook fire station, where anguished parents awaited news of their kids on the day of the shooting, a neighbor still hangs a sign that reads "God Bless the Families." It is accompanied by a large heart that frames 20 wooden crosses.

Some shop windows still display the green and white cards that were all over town after the shooting: "We are Sandy Hook. We choose love."

But at a local coffee shop, no one appeared to be talking about the shooting unless asked about it.

The site of the shooting is scheduled to be torn down and replaced by a new structure that still awaits formal approval. It is due to open in time for the 2016 school year and is expected to be enclosed in a high fence and be watched over by armed guards.

byline: By Chris Francescani
12:12am EDT

A New York police officer has been indicted on three felony counts of falsifying records to justify his arrest last year of a New York Times photographer, the Bronx district attorney said.

A Bronx grand jury indicted NYPD officer Michael Ackermann on Monday in a case stemming from his arrest in August 2012 of photographer Robert Stolarik, whom Ackermann said had interfered with the arrest of a teenage girl.

Ackermann, 30, said in a police report at the time that Stolarik had repeatedly set off the flash on his camera in his face - blinding and distracting him - during the arrest.

But Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said in a statement that an investigation determined that Stolarik's camera did not have a flash attached at the time of the arrest, which took place at 10:30 p.m. on August 4, 2012.

Ackerman was indicted on three felony counts and five misdemeanor counts of falsifying records and making false statements.

He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of the most serious felony, tampering with public records. Ackermann was released without bail on Monday following an arraignment in state court in the Bronx.

He has been suspended without pay pending the outcome of his criminal case, NYPD Deputy Commissioner John McCarthy said .

Ackermann's attorney, Michael Martinez, did not immediately return a call for comment.

All charges against Stolarik, a longtime freelance New York Times photographer, have been dismissed, Johnson's office said.

Stolarik was photographing the arrest of a teenage girl following a street fight when a police officer told him to stop taking pictures, according to an account of the incident published last year in the New York Times.

Stolarik said he identified himself as a Times photographer and continued to shoot pictures.

A second officer grabbed his camera and "slammed" it into his face, he told the newspaper. He said police took his cameras and roughed him up before arresting him on charges of obstructing government administration and resisting arrest.

Following the arrest, police officials said Stolarik and others had been repeatedly ordered to move back, but that Stolarik pressed forward and inadvertently struck an officer in the face with his camera. They said Stolarik "violently" resisted arrest, according to the New York Times.

Stolarik did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A New York Times spokeswoman, Abbe Serphos, said in a statement, "We are pleased that officials in the Bronx took a serious look at this case and brought an indictment after finding police misconduct."

headline: Missing U.S. teenager, fascinated with wilderness movie, found dead
byline: By Karen Brooks
12:12am EDT

The body of an Arizona teenager whose disappearance into the woods a week ago may have been inspired by a movie about a young man who died after venturing into the Alaskan wilderness has been found in Oregon.

The death of 18-year-old Johnathan Croom, whose body was found on Monday evening in a wooded area in Oregon about 1,000 feet from his 2000 Honda CRV, is being investigated as a suicide, a statement from Douglas County Sheriff's Office said.

No other information was released in the statement from the office late on Monday.

Croom's car was found abandoned last week near the small town of Riddle, Oregon, in the southwestern part of the state. His identification and money were found inside the car.

Croom had failed to return on August 22 to resume classes at Mesa Community College in Arizona after driving to visit a friend in Washington state.

Croom's father David said son had sent a text message to a friend more than a week ago saying: "I'm going adventuring."

Speaking to Reuters on Sunday, David Croom described his son as a happy young man with an electric smile who in the past six months had grown fascinated by the true story of Christopher McCandless portrayed in the 2007 movie "Into the Wild."

In the early 1990s, McCandless, a recent college graduate, embarked on a cross-continental journey, discarding his possessions and living in the rugged Alaskan wilderness, where he eventually died of starvation.

McCandless' story was first made famous by a best-selling non-fiction book, "Into the Wild," by adventure writer Jon Krakauer, published in 1996, and then the movie.

The Douglas County Sheriff's Office found Croom's car on Wednesday.

David Croom said residents had told him they had noticed the abandoned vehicle as early as the weekend before that. He said he had been told by a logger that he had seen a young man with "the most amazing grin" walking with a woman two days earlier. Croom said he did not know who the woman might have been.

Croom said his son had split up with his girlfriend a few weeks ago and that may have been weighing on his mind.

Volunteers joined the search for the missing teenager, including one group that offered to send in drones and horses.

Aside from a stint with the Boy Scouts of America, David Croom said his son had little outdoors experience.

"He doesn't really have the skill set for this," he said.

Croom said he had not been aware of his son's fascination with McCandless' journey until after he went missing.

"The problem I have with that movie is that several kids have tried to emulate it, and what he was doing was dangerous," he said. "The guy in the movie doesn't make it."

headline: Preliminary hearing starts in U.S. Naval Academy rape case
byline: By Lacey Johnson
12:12am EDT

A preliminary hearing for three former U.S. Naval Academy football players charged with raping a drunken female midshipman got under way on Tuesday, the latest in a string of sexual assault allegations in the U.S. military.

The midshipmen - Tra'ves Bush, Eric Graham and Joshua Tate - have been charged with sexually assaulting the woman in April 2012 while she was passed out after drinking too much at an off-campus party.

The so-called Article 32 hearing will determine if a general court-martial is warranted. Navy Commander Robert Monahan, who is presiding over the case at Washington's Navy Yard, is expected to take several days to weigh the evidence.

Academy Superintendent Vice Admiral Michael Miller - after a probe by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service - in June ordered that Bush, Graham and Tate be charged with sexual assault and making false statements.

The investigation was touched off by allegations of an incident at the party in Annapolis, Maryland, site of the elite academy that educates Navy and Marine officers. The woman's attorney, Susan Burke, said in May that her client got drunk and passed out at the party at a "football house."

She woke up with little recollection of what had happened, and later learned that three football players were claiming to have had sexual intercourse with her while she was drunk, Burke said.

Burke said one of the football players pressured the woman not to cooperate with investigators. But when she followed the advice she was "ostracized and retaliated against by the football players and the Naval Academy community."

The woman was also disciplined for drinking. She sought legal help in early 2013 and the Navy reopened the investigation, Burke said.

Reuters generally does not publish the names of sexual assault victims.

The hearing comes after a spate of high-profile military sexual assault cases, including some involving personnel whose job it was to prevent sexual abuse.

An annual Pentagon study this year estimated that unwanted sexual contact in the military, from groping to rape, jumped by 37 percent in 2012 to 26,000 cases.

President Barack Obama told Marines at Camp Pendleton, California, this month that sexual assault undermined the U.S. military. He also spoke at the Naval Academy's graduation ceremony in May and urged the new officers to stamp out sexual assault in their ranks.

The increased number of sex-related incidents in the military prompted members of Congress to introduce legislation to toughen the Pentagon's handling of sex crimes.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and military service chiefs have opposed taking sexual assault prosecution decisions out of the chain of command.



headline: SEC says Indiana man used Ponzi scheme to fund a reality TV show
byline: By Jonathan Stempel
12:12am EDT

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged an Indiana man with running a $6 million Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors out of their retirement savings and used the money to invest in a bridal store, a bounty hunter reality television show, and a soul food restaurant owned by the bounty hunters.

The SEC on Monday said it obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of defendants John Marcum and his firm Guaranty Reserves Trust LLC.

Marcum, 49, of Noblesville, Indiana, was accused of deceiving at least 37 people into investing in promissory notes issued by his firm by promising double-digit annual returns with no risk to principal by day-trading in stocks.

"Marcum tricked investors into putting their retirement nest eggs in his hands by portraying himself as a talented trader who could earn high returns while eliminating the risk of loss," said Timothy Warren, acting director of the SEC's Chicago regional office.

The SEC said Marcum regularly gave clients account statements showing annualized returns of more than 20 percent with no monthly losses.

Instead, the regulator said he lost more than $900,000 on what little trading he conducted, and used the remaining funds to invest in start-up ventures and finance a lifestyle including Mercedes-Benz car payments, airline tickets, nightclub outlays, and charges to his former wife's credit card.

The SEC said none of the start-ups appears profitable, and that Marcum "is nearly broke, and his accounts contain less than $2,000." It said the scheme began to unravel in mid-2013 when Marcum became unable to meet some investors' redemption demands.

According to the regulator, Marcum admitted misappropriating investor money during a June 18 conference call with three investors, which was recorded.

It said he also told investors during the call that his insurance policies had a two-year waiting period for a "suicide clause" to take effect, and that if he failed to return their money he would kill himself so they could be made whole.

A lawyer for Marcum did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Marcum could not immediately be located.

The lawsuit seeks a fine, the recovery of ill-gotten gains, and a permanent ban on further wrongdoing.

The case is SEC v. Marcum et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Indiana, No. 13-01361.



headline: Another San Diego worker files claim, saying mayor harassed her
byline: By Dan Whitcomb
12:12am EDT

A San Diego parks employee who says Mayor Bob Filner put her in a headlock and rubbed against her breasts at a public event this year filed a $500,000 battery and sexual harassment claim against the city on Monday, her attorney said.

Stacy McKenzie, one of 18 women who accuse Filner of making unwanted sexual advances, is the second in two months to initiate legal action against the embattled politician. Her claim is the precursor to a lawsuit.

Filner, a former Democratic congressman who was elected mayor of California's second-largest city last year, announced on Friday that he would step down effective August 30 as part of a settlement with the city over a lawsuit filed by his former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson.

The city had filed its own suit against Filner, 70, seeking to recover any damages it might incur in Jackson's case. The City Council also voted to deny a request from the mayor's private lawyers to pick up any of his attorney fees.

McKenzie, a parks department district manager who has worked for the city for 32 years, alleged that the mayor touched her inappropriately during a public event in April.

"Filner, who was attending the event as a dignitary, sexually battered Ms. McKenzie after asking her on a date when he pursued her across a city park where families were gathered, grabbed her from behind and put her into a headlock with his right arm rubbing across her breasts and his left arm rubbing her upper arm," her attorney, Dan Gilleon, said in a statement.

In her written claim, McKenzie accuses the city of failing to prevent sexual harassment by Filner or to warn of his "predatory nature." The claim seeks $500,000 in compensatory and punitive damages.

"Although the city attorney previously stated he 'will not under any circumstance represent Bob Filner,' he has now switched corners and is defending the mayor," Gilleon said.

'WRONG MESSAGE'

"We believe downplaying Filner's conduct is not only legally wrong, it also sends the wrong message for a high profile, elected official to minimize the very type of sexual battery he has previously condemned," Gilleon said.

"At the same time, our client does not want her case to cost the city millions of dollars. We hope the city attorney will put aside both hats he has been wearing and negotiate a fair and balanced settlement," he added.

Neither a law firm representing Filner nor his press secretary could be reached on Monday afternoon for comment about the claim. A spokesman for San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith did not immediately return calls seeking comment.

In announcing his resignation on Friday, an emotional Filner apologized to San Diego residents but said no sexual harassment allegations had been proven against him.

"In a lynch mob mentality, rumors become allegations, allegations become facts, facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall," he said.

Since Jackson filed her suit last month, 17 more women have come forward to accuse Filner of groping, forced kisses or making other unwanted advances.

Among them were a retired U.S. Navy admiral, a college dean, a licensed vocational nurse, several business women and two military veterans who said he harassed them at a meeting for women who had been raped while serving in the armed forces.

Nearly every elected official in San Diego from both parties urged him to step down, including all nine members of City Council. The mayor has apologized for what he acknowledged was a pattern of disrespectful and intimidating behavior toward women.

terrorism cases against American citizens.

The August report revealed that a secretive DEA unit passes the NSA information to agents in the field, including those from the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI and Homeland Security, with instructions to never disclose the original source, even in court. In most cases, the NSA tips involve drugs, money laundering and organized crime, not terrorism.

Five Democrats in the Senate and three senior Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee submitted questions to Holder about the NSA-DEA relationship, joining two prominent Republicans who have expressed concerns. The matter will be discussed during classified briefings scheduled for September, Republican and Democratic aides said.

"These allegations raise serious concerns that gaps in the policy and law are allowing overreach by the federal government's intelligence gathering apparatus," wrote the senators - Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Tom Udall of New Mexico, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sherrod Brown of Ohio.

Holder, an appointee of U.S. President Barack Obama, is the country's top lawman as head of the Justice Department. The Justice Department is reviewing the congressional inquiry, a spokesman for Holder said on Monday.

The Reuters reports cited internal documents that show how DEA's Special Operations Division funnels information from overseas NSA intercepts, domestic wiretaps, informants and a large DEA database of telephone records to authorities nationwide to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.

The documents show that agents have been trained to conceal how such investigations truly begin - to "recreate" the investigative trail to effectively cover up the original source of the information, raising questions about whether exculpatory information might be withheld from defendants at trial.

'PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION'

The internal documents describe the process of recreating the evidence trail to omit any reference to the Special Operations Division as "parallel construction." For example, agents said in interviews, they act as if a drug investigation began with a traffic stop for speeding or a broken taillight, instead of a tip passed from the NSA. An IRS document describes a similar process for tax agency investigators.

Justice Department officials have said they are reviewing the matter. DEA officials have said the practice is legal and has been in near-daily use since the 1990s. The purpose is to protect sources and methods, not to withhold evidence, they said.

wrote to Holder on August 9, shortly after the original Reuters report.

"If this report is accurate, then it describes an unacceptable breakdown in the barrier between foreign intelligence surveillance and criminal process," the congressmen wrote.

On the CBS program Face the Nation on August 18, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, a Republican, said the use of NSA intelligence to make non-terrorism cases should be scrutinized. "I think we need to have a very careful examination of this. I think that the trust of the American people in their government is what's at stake here," he said.

election on Monday, railing against President Barack Obama's healthcare reform and touting her support of jobs and businesses.

Flanked by three Republican governors and standing before a crowd of about 60 supporters and protesters at a rally in Greenville, Haley pushed her business credentials and said she had brought thousands of jobs to the state.

"I promised I'd bring jobs to South Carolina," Haley said, speaking on the same day her campaign released a web video featuring endorsements by members of her state's business community. "As of today, 37,500 jobs in 45 of 46 counties. That's what we did in South Carolina."

Haley was swept into office on a tide of Tea Party support in 2010 when she was a junior state legislator. The daughter of immigrants from India, she was the first woman elected governor of South Carolina.

She also used the appearance on Monday to slam the Affordable Care Act, saying she was proud of the state for not expanding Medicaid "just because President Obama said we needed to."

States have come under fire for not expanding Medicaid by advocates who say it will leave the poor with no coverage, but conservatives argue that Medicaid is broken.

Some protesters booed her speech, but Haley responded by thanking them for being there, saying that her husband, Michael, was fighting in Afghanistan to give them that right.

Haley was joined on Monday by fellow Republican governors Rick Perry of Texas, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who used the occasion to take a swipe at Haley's Democratic opponent, who lost to her in 2010.

Jindal said Democrats like her opponent, state Senator Vincent Sheheen, "measure success in government by how many people are dependent on government."

Republicans, he said, measure success by how many people are not dependent on government, "not because we kicked them out, not because we pushed them to the curb."

Haley raised $619,000 in the latest campaign contributions filing period and had almost $2.5 million cash on hand as of July 10. Sheheen had raised about $611,000 in the same time period and had about $571,000 cash on hand.

A statewide poll conducted in April showed Haley's job approval rating at 43.5 percent.

Haley's administration was criticized last year after the nation's largest security breach of data from a state agency. Hackers stole millions of taxpayers' Social Security numbers, tax records and credit card numbers from state Department of Revenue computers that were, in some cases, 30 years old.

Haley also paid ethics fines for misreporting campaign contributions.



headline: Yosemite blaze rages closer to reservoir for San Francisco
byline: By Laila Kearney
12:12am EDT

One of the largest California wildfires in decades roared largely unchecked for a 10th day through forests in and around Yosemite National Park on Monday and threatened a reservoir that supplies most of San Francisco's water.

As of midday, the eastern flank of the so-called Rim Fire had burned to within a mile of Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy reservoir on the Tuolumne River, raising concerns about the possibility of ash and soot contaminating the sprawling artificial lake.

On Saturday, flames had been no closer than 4 miles from the reservoir, which supplies 85 percent of the water consumed by 2.6 million people in San Francisco and several communities in three adjacent counties about 200 miles to the west.

Roughly 300 million gallons of water is carried to the San Francisco Bay area daily through tunnels and an aqueduct, and reservoir samples show water quality has remained healthy since the fire began on August 17, according to a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.

"There's no evidence of a change in the water quality, and there's no change in our ability to deliver that water to all of our customers," said the spokeswoman, Suzanne Gautier.

If fallout from the blaze were to foul the Hetch Hetchy, its water could be diverted to a smaller Bay Area reservoir for filtration at a local treatment plant before delivery to customers, she said.

The Rim Fire, named for a Stanislaus National Forest lookout point called Rim of the World, has already damaged two of the three hydropower generating stations linked to the Hetch Hetchy reservoir that supply electricity for all of San Francisco's public facilities, such as hospitals and firehouses.

Gautier said the city for now was continuing to draw on reserve power stored for emergencies and purchasing additional electricity on the open market to make up for the difference.

Despite threats to water and power, firefighters have made headway against the blaze, although rugged terrain and the fire's remote location were complicating efforts to subdue the flames, fire managers said.

"There are places where they can't get in," said Mike Ferris, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. "It's just inaccessible."

As of Monday morning, fire crews working with hand tools and backed by bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters had carved containment lines around 15 percent of the blaze's perimeter, more than double Sunday's figure, though the fire's footprint continued to grow.

OVER 200 SQUARE MILES SCORCHED

The blaze in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains was among the fastest-moving of some 50 large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West. The fires have strained resources and prompted fire managers to open talks with Pentagon commanders and Canadian officials about possible reinforcements.

According to the latest estimates, the Rim Fire has charred nearly 150,000 acres or 234 square miles - the size of the city of Chicago - most of that in the Stanislaus National Forest west of Yosemite.

That ranks the blaze as the largest wildfire in California since August 2009, when the so-called Station Fire ravaged nearly 145,000 acres of the Angeles National Park north of Los Angeles, and one of the 20 biggest in state history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

By Monday morning, nearly 22,000 acres within Yosemite had burned, forcing the closure of the main road leading into the park from the San Francisco Bay area and prompting the evacuation of 74 campsites in the park's White Wolf area, officials said. (<a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>)

But the majority of the 1,200-square-mile Yosemite National Park, including the Yosemite Valley area famous for its towering rock formations, waterfalls, meadows and pine forests, remained open to the public.

The fire was not believed to pose a threat to the concrete structure of the 90-year-old O'Shaughnessy Dam, which forms the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, or of the granite basin it was built into, Gautier said.

But in addition to the immediate potential fallout of ash and soot, Hetch Hetchy's water could be left vulnerable to heavy runoff of debris and topsoil stripped of vegetation by the blaze and washed into the reservoir by winter rains, she said.

"When you burn down everything, you've got a moonscape out there when floods can contaminate the water," Governor Jerry Brown said during a visit to the fire zone on Monday. He declared a state of emergency for San Francisco on Friday due to threats to the city's water supply.

The blaze has destroyed about a dozen homes and 1,000 outbuildings, and some 4,500 additional dwellings remained threatened. Residents in the tiny town of Tuolumne and other communities near the western edge of the park were evacuated, but evacuation orders have been lifted for the enclaves of Pine Mountain Lake and Buck Meadows.

The cause of the wildfire remained under investigation. More than 3,700 firefighters have been assigned to the blaze, which was burning over steep terrain through scrub, oak and pine, stoked by stiff winds, high temperatures and low humidity.



headline: Hundreds of dogs rescued in multi-state dog fighting case

Some 367 pit bulls, many scarred and emaciated, have been rescued and a dozen people across the southeastern United States have been charged with dog fighting in what animal advocacy groups called one of the largest such raids in U.S. history.

"The number of dogs seized and the amount of money involved in this case shows how extensive this underworld of dog fighting is," U.S. Attorney for the Middle District Alabama George Beck said in a statement on Monday. "These dog fighters abuse, starve and kill their dogs for the supposed 'fun' of watching and gambling on a dog fight."

The suspects, who come from Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and Texas, face multiple charges related to dog fighting and gambling, with each charge carrying up to five years in prison. Dog fighting is a felony in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

At one site, some 114 emaciated, wounded dogs were found chained to tires, without food and water, and in makeshift shelters in scorching summer heat, rescue groups said.

"Thousands of others all over the country continue to endure unimaginable suffering and death just like this at the hands of dog fighters," said Tim Rickey of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which along with the Humane Society of the United States helped remove the dogs.

"We want to end it once and for all."

The U.S. Attorney said in a statement that the charges are the result of a three-year investigation by nearly two dozen state, local and federal agencies. They seized more than $500,000, drugs, guns and other evidence in what they called a high-stakes ring that saw bets up to $200,000 per fight, according to the statement.

This size of this raid is second only in the United States to a 2009 case in which more than 500 dogs were rescued and more than 100 people in eight states were arrested, according to the ASPCA.

terrorism cases against American citizens.

The August report revealed that a secretive DEA unit passes the NSA information to agents in the field, including those from the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI and Homeland Security, with instructions to never disclose the original source, even in court. In most cases, the NSA tips involve drugs, money laundering and organized crime, not terrorism.

Five Democrats in the Senate and three senior Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee submitted questions to Holder about the NSA-DEA relationship, joining two prominent Republicans who have expressed concerns. The matter will be discussed during classified briefings scheduled for September, Republican and Democratic aides said.

"These allegations raise serious concerns that gaps in the policy and law are allowing overreach by the federal government's intelligence gathering apparatus," wrote the senators - Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Tom Udall of New Mexico, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sherrod Brown of Ohio.

Holder, an appointee of U.S. President Barack Obama, is the country's top lawman as head of the Justice Department. The Justice Department is reviewing the congressional inquiry, a spokesman for Holder said on Monday.

The Reuters reports cited internal documents that show how DEA's Special Operations Division funnels information from overseas NSA intercepts, domestic wiretaps, informants and a large DEA database of telephone records to authorities nationwide to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.

The documents show that agents have been trained to conceal how such investigations truly begin - to "recreate" the investigative trail to effectively cover up the original source of the information, raising questions about whether exculpatory information might be withheld from defendants at trial.

'PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION'

The internal documents describe the process of recreating the evidence trail to omit any reference to the Special Operations Division as "parallel construction." For example, agents said in interviews, they act as if a drug investigation began with a traffic stop for speeding or a broken taillight, instead of a tip passed from the NSA. An IRS document describes a similar process for tax agency investigators.

Justice Department officials have said they are reviewing the matter. DEA officials have said the practice is legal and has been in near-daily use since the 1990s. The purpose is to protect sources and methods, not to withhold evidence, they said.

wrote to Holder on August 9, shortly after the original Reuters report.

"If this report is accurate, then it describes an unacceptable breakdown in the barrier between foreign intelligence surveillance and criminal process," the congressmen wrote.

On the CBS program Face the Nation on August 18, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, a Republican, said the use of NSA intelligence to make non-terrorism cases should be scrutinized. "I think we need to have a very careful examination of this. I think that the trust of the American people in their government is what's at stake here," he said.



headline: Following NY lawsuit, online lender to cease funding loans
byline: By Nate Raymond
12:12am EDT

An online lender accused by the New York attorney general of "scamming" consumers with high interest rates says it will cease funding loans next week.

Western Sky Financial LLC, which says it is owned by a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, posted a notice on its website saying it would cease funding loans on September 3.

No reasons were given. The notice came two weeks after Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued the company in a state court in Manhattan for charging interest rates as high as 355 percent for consumers who took out personal loans.

The interest rates exceeded the maximum 16 percent most lenders are allowed to charge under New York law, the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit, which also named CashCall Inc and its affiliate WS Funding LLC among other parties, said since 2010, Western Sky lent more than $38 million to New Yorkers via 17,970 loans.

Western Sky had already stopped lending to New York residents in March, amid the investigation. A spokeswoman for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company had faced several other recent regulatory challenges by state officials.

The Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services on August 1 sent out a notice of intention to issue a cease and desist order against Western Sky.

The Michigan action came days after Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens sued Western Sky for making illegal payday loans.

In addition to Schneiderman's lawsuit, the New York State Department of Financial Services had also this month demanded Western Sky and 34 other companies stop offering online payday loans to New Yorkers.

Western Sky had claimed immunity from state and federal law because of its ties to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. A lawyer for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

The case is People of the State of New York v. Western Sky Financial, et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451370/2013.



headline: New Mexico's largest county to allow gay marriage after court ruling
byline: By Zelie Pollon
12:12am EDT

sex marriages are now legal in New Mexico's most populous county and the city of Albuquerque, a court ruled on Monday, adding to recent victories for gays and lesbians seeking the right to wed statewide.

Last week, a judge in Santa Fe County ordered the county clerk there to issue same-sex marriage licenses and a clerk in the southern part of the state decided to hand out such licenses independently of any court ruling.

The ruling could set precedent for expanding the right of gays and lesbians to eventually marry statewide in New Mexico, said representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union.

Denying gays and lesbians the right to marry violates the state constitution, which prohibits gender-based discrimination, wrote Bernalillo County Judge Alan Malott in a decision on Monday clearing the way for same-sex marriage in that county.

"Gay and lesbian citizens of New Mexico have endured a long history of discrimination," Malott ruled. "Denial of the right to marry continues this unfortunate, intolerable pattern and establishes irreparable injury on plaintiffs' part."

The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Center for Lesbian Rights on behalf of same-sex couples seeking the right to marry. It is one of several cases filed recently in New Mexico on the question of gay marriage.

The case included plaintiffs from Santa Fe County and the judge also ruled that gay marriage licenses should be issued there. But a ruling last week by a different judge had already cleared the way for same-sex marriage in Santa Fe County.

Under Malott's ruling, Bernalillo County, with 673,000 residents, will also be required to immediately issue same-sex marriage licenses.

That will mean that three counties in New Mexico will hand out the licenses, including Do単a Ana County in southern New Mexico where the county clerk last week said he would start doing so.

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage.

"Our state is now on the brink of joining the growing list of states who live and honor the values of family, liberty and love," Peter Simonson, ACLU of New Mexico executive director, said in a statement.

The group was not sure how the ruling would affect the state's other 30 counties which are not issuing same-sex marriage licenses, said Micah McCoy, spokesman for the ACLU of New Mexico.

"It's a pretty unconventional route for this kind of case to take, but it will be very useful in arguing the case in other counties where people want to get married," McCoy said.

The New Mexico Supreme Court has declined to rule on lawsuits seeking the right for gays and lesbians to marry, but asked lower courts to handle them first.

Republican lawmakers in the state said they were contemplating ways to fight the decisions by the district court judges in Bernalillo and Santa Fe counties as well as the Dona Ana County Clerk's move to issue same-sex marriage licenses.

"It is inexplicable how a district court just today discovered a new definition of marriage in our laws, when our marriage law has not been changed in over a century," State Senator Bill Sharer, a Republican, said in a statement.

headline: U.S. Army sergeant receives Medal of Honor at White House ceremony
byline: By Ian Simpson
12:12am EDT

President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor on Monday to Army Staff Sergeant Ty Carter, who risked his life to save a wounded soldier under enemy fire during a battle in Afghanistan.

As Carter's family and members of his unit looked on, Obama placed the medal around the soldier's neck at a White House ceremony. It is the highest U.S. military honor.

Carter, 33, is the fifth living service member to receive the Medal of Honor for gallantry in Afghanistan or Iraq.

Carter, who also has been awarded the Purple Heart, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and is an advocate of treatment for others with the ailment, Obama said.

The president took the opportunity to raise the issue of PTSD in the military and urged soldiers not to be ashamed of it.

"It is absolutely critical for us to work with brave young men like Ty to put an end to any stigma that keeps more folks from seeking help," Obama said with Carter at his side.

Carter was the second U.S. soldier to receive the award for bravery for actions on October 3, 2009, when more than 300 Taliban insurgents tried to overrun 53 soldiers at Combat Outpost Keating in Afghanistan's isolated Nuristan province.

The outpost came under "a blizzard of bullets and steel, into which Ty ran not once, or twice, or even a few times, but perhaps 10 times," Obama said.

"In doing so, he displayed the essence of true heroism - not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but to serve others at whatever cost."

Carter, a cavalry scout with the 4th Infantry Division, resupplied ammunition to fighting positions. He fired on advancing Taliban from a Humvee, killing attackers and helping to turn back the assault.

He left the vehicle to rescue a badly wounded comrade, applying a tourniquet and first aid under fire before carrying him back to the Humvee and then to an aid station. That soldier later died of his injuries.

EXPOSED TO GUNFIRE

Carter again exposed himself to gunfire to cut down a burning tree that was threatening the aid station, Obama said.

Eight U.S. soldiers were killed and more than 25 were wounded in the battle at Keating outpost. Obama introduced relatives of those who died at the base, drawing a standing ovation from onlookers, and many family members wiped away tears.

After the ceremony, Carter said he was eager to represent those who had suffered as a result of the war.

"Only those closest to me can see the scars that come from seeing good men take their last breath," he told reporters.

Carter said during the battle he had lost some hearing in his left ear, but he said he would hear the cries of his wounded comrade forever.

Thanks to support from his superiors, friends and his family, Carter said: "I will heal."

"I promise the mothers, the fathers, and spouses of my fallen brothers that I will strive to live up to the responsibility this medal carries," he said.

"I give these men and their families all my respect, my humility and honor."

The battle was the first since the Vietnam War in which two living service members earned the Medal of Honor. Staff Sergeant Clinton Romesha received his medal in February.

Carter, who grew up in Spokane, Washington, enlisted in January 2008 and completed a second Afghanistan deployment in October. He is assigned to the 7th Infantry Division, serving at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state. Carter is married with three children.

The last battle for which two living service members received the Medal of Honor was the 1967 Battle of Ap Bac in Vietnam, a spokeswoman for the Congressional Medal of Honor Society said.



headline: New test aims to benchmark skills of U.S. college graduates
byline: By Daniel Lovering
1:08am EDT

Seniors returning to classes at dozens of U.S. colleges and universities have one more hurdle to prepare for this school year: a new standardized test for graduating students intended to give prospective employers a measure of their abilities.

Called Collegiate Learning Assessment Plus (CLA+), the test aims to provide a more objective way to compare the intellectual achievements of graduates of different schools.

"It's another set of information that employers can use to review the applicant," said Robert Keeley, director of assessment services at the Council for Aid to Education, the New York-based nonprofit that has developed the test. "We're looking to equip students to share their scores more readily than they have in the past."

About 200 colleges and universities, including small liberal arts colleges Ursuline College of Pepper Pike, Ohio, and Stonehill College of Easton, Massachusetts as well as some of the California and Texas state university systems, have signed up to give the CLA+ tests at the end of the academic year now getting underway.

The test will measure analysis, problem solving, writing, quantitative reasoning and reading, the Council for Aid to Education said.

It could serve a similar role to the admission exams that graduate schools rely on as a standard evaluation for their applicants.

Students will be able to incorporate the results of the CLA+ test into their resumes and have the option of sending copies of the reports to potential employers, Keeley said.

The tests could help address the problem of grade inflation, with schools awarding higher grades over the years in an effort to attract and retain students, said Michael Poliakoff, vice president of policy at the nonprofit American Council of Trustees and Alumni.

"Employers want to see something they can rely on," Poliakoff said. "They don't want to see a portfolio of things that show a candidate may or may not have done."

Poliakoff, who participated in a focus group on the test's development, said the test could help graduates demonstrate "just how valid those grades on a transcript are."

The test is being phased in at a time when U.S. officials are wrestling with the rising cost of a college education. President Barack Obama last week proposed a plan to tackle soaring U.S. education costs with a new system that judges colleges and universities on their financial value and ties those ratings to disbursement of federal aid.

The plan calls on the U.S. Department of Education to institute a ratings system before the 2015 school year that would allow students and parents to select schools based on the best value for the money.

Douglas Bennett, a Council for Aid to Education board member and emeritus professor of politics at Earlham College in Indiana, said the test showed promise.

"A dirty secret about higher education for a very long while is, we've had no particularly good ways of knowing the most important thing, and that is whether students are learning," he said. "Partly that's been because we didn't have the right, clever ideas to figure out how to do that."

headline: State of Georgia high court to hear appeal on lethal injections
byline: By David Beasley
12:12am EDT

Georgia's Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear an appeal in the case of a death row inmate who challenged a new law shielding the identity and methods of companies that make the state's lethal injection drugs.

The decision could delay the execution of Warren Lee Hill by months, the court said.

Hill, 53, was sentenced to die for fatally beating another inmate in 1990 while serving a life sentence for killing his girlfriend. His lawyers claim he is mentally disabled and should not be executed.

Hill's execution was scheduled for July 19 but delayed by Fulton County Judge Gail Tusan after Hill challenged the constitutionality of Georgia's new law concealing the source of lethal injection drugs from the public, attorneys and judges in court proceedings.

The law was passed in March by legislators concerned about the dwindling supplies of pentobarbital, the injection drug, amid pressure by anti-death penalty activists on companies that provide lethal injection drugs to the state, attorneys said.

Attorneys for the state said the law was designed to protect the companies from harassment and lawsuits. But Hill's lawyers argued the law made it impossible to determine whether a drug has been tainted with other substances that could cause excessive pain to the prisoner.

The state of Georgia appealed Tusan's ruling to the state Supreme Court.

In agreeing to hear the case, the court on Monday asked attorneys to address four questions, including whether providing a sample of the execution drug to Hill's attorneys for testing prior to the execution would be a way to the resolve the case.

Oral arguments will likely be held in the next several months, the court said. Meanwhile, a stay of execution for Hill remained in place.

Lauren Kane, spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, declined to comment on Monday's decision. Brian Kammer, Hill's attorney, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.

In addition to challenging the constitutionality of the new state law, Hill's lawyers have also filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing he should not be executed because he is mentally disabled.



headline: Two charged with stealing source code from NY trading firm

frequency trading firm in an effort to start their own business.

Jason Vuu, 26, a former trader at Flow Traders LLC in Manhattan, was charged with emailing himself trading strategies, valuation algorithms and proprietary code from the firm and sharing the code with another man, Simon Lu, 25, according to criminal complaints filed by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance.

Another former trader at Flow Traders, Glen Cressman, 26, was charged with copying files containing trading strategies and valuation algorithms without permission, the complaints said.

Paul Shechtman, a lawyer for Lu, and Jeremy Saland, a lawyer for Vuu, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.

Charles Ross, who represents Cressman, said his client was innocent.

"He was a fine employee, and when everything about the case is aired, it will be clear he did nothing wrong," Ross said.

A lawyer for Flow Traders, which according to its website is an international proprietary trading house headquartered in Amsterdam, could not be reached immediately for comment.

The three men were arraigned on the charges two weeks ago and are due back in court on November 18, when they could face grand jury indictments. Lu currently resides in Pittsburgh, Vuu in California, and Cressman in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, according to prosecutors.

The arrests came a year after Vance's office charged former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (<span id="symbol_GS.N_0">GS.N</span>) programmer Sergey Aleynikov with stealing secret trading code. Aleynikov had been previously been convicted in federal court for the same actions, but his conviction was thrown out in February 2012 by an appeals court, which said federal espionage laws did not cover his alleged theft.

Vance then charged Aleynikov under New York state law. Earlier this year, a judge denied Aleynikov's attempt to have the state charges dismissed on double jeopardy grounds. Aleynikov, who pleaded not guilty, is free on bail.

Both Vance and the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, Preet Bharara, whose office brought the initial case against Aleynikov, have made combating computer crime and corporate espionage a top priority.

Lu, Vuu and Cressman all face multiple counts of unlawful duplication of computer-related material and unauthorized use of secret scientific material, the same charges Aleynikov is facing. The charges carry sentences of up to four years in prison.

Vuu sent copies of files from his work email account to his personal email address 10 times from August 2011 to August 2012, the complaint said. He also shared source code with Lu via the file-hosting service Dropbox after Lu suggested the code could help them start their own firm, according to the complaint.

Cressman's personal email account received copied files containing trading strategies and valuation algorithms twice in December 2012, according to the complaint.

The charges were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

old World War Two veteran who survived the Battle of Okinawa, police said on Monday.

Kenan Adams-Kinard was taken into custody without incident in Spokane, Washington, overnight on suspicion of first-degree burglary and first-degree murder in the slaying of Delbert Belton, Spokane police said in a statement.

"Good investigative work and follow up on dozens of tips led to the apprehension of the suspect four days after the initial incident," the statement said.

Another 16-year-old suspect in the death, Demetrius Glenn, surrendered to police on Thursday over the killing of Belton, a U.S. Army veteran who was shot in the leg during the Battle of Okinawa as Allied forces began their invasion of Japan's home islands in 1945.

Belton had been waiting in the parking lot of a fraternal lodge on Spokane's north side last Wednesday to meet a friend. The friend arrived to find him in his car, severely beaten in the face and head. The longtime Spokane resident died the following day.

Surveillance videos and still photographs from the lodge and surrounding businesses led police to identify the two teens as suspects.

Police said Adams-Kinard was located in the basement of a Spokane apartment building, and that several other people with him were also arrested for rendering criminal assistance.

Glenn will be advised of the charges against him on Monday afternoon. Adams-Kinard will make his first court appearance on Tuesday.



headline: Fort Hood shooting victim struggling to cope with injuries
byline: By Ellen Wulfhorst
12:12am EDT

A U.S. Army staff sergeant partly paralyzed and brain damaged from the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, on Monday said his injuries left him deeply angry and worried about finding work, remaining married and caring for his infant son.

Staff Sergeant Patrick Ziegler was one of a dozen witnesses to tell of their losses in the sentencing phase for Major Nidal Hasan, who was convicted on Friday of killing 13 people and wounding 31 others in the November 5, 2009 attack on unarmed fellow service members. Family members of those slain talked of being suicidal and of seemingly insurmountable grief.

Hasan could face execution. The military jury of 13 officers who convicted him are now considering his punishment.

Some witnesses lost their composure as they testified about the toll of the slaughter on their lives. Young widow Cristi Greene broke down into sobs that obscured much of what she tried to say about her slain husband, Specialist Frederick Greene, age 29.

Jennifer Hunt, the widow of Specialist Jason Hunt, 22, said she twice had attempted suicide since his death.

"I pretty much lost my mind for a while," she testified.

Juan Velez recalled the day he learned his pregnant daughter Private Francheska Velez, 21, died at the hands of Hasan.

"It hurt me down to the bottom of my soul," Velez said. "He killed my grandson and he killed me, slowly."

Ziegler, who limped heavily to the witness stand, testified that he was shot four times, including once in the head. He underwent emergency surgery that removed 20 percent of his brain, he said.

"I was expected to either die or remain in a vegetative state for the rest of my life," he testified. He was 27 at the time of the shooting.

His injuries rendered him partly paralyzed, unable to use his left hand and with vision troubles, he said. A college graduate, Ziegler said he now has the cognitive abilities of a 10th- or 11th-grader and fears he will be unable to hold a regular job when he is discharged from the military next month.

"Eventually I will succumb to my wounds," he said. "I won't be able to function."

The shooting left him severely depressed and angry, he said.

"It pretty much affected every facet of my personality. I'm a lot angrier and a lot darker than I used to be," he testified.

He said his wife "kind of has to lead me around," and in caring for his 10-month-old son, he said: "I'm unable to interact and play with him like a normal father would."

Hasan did not cross-examine any of the witnesses during Monday's hearing. During the trial, Hasan did not call any witnesses on his behalf.

DEATH PENALTY POSSIBLE

Hasan, a psychiatrist, was convicted of 45 charges of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder. If the jury is unanimous, he could face the death penalty by lethal injection, possibly making him the first U.S. soldier to be executed by the U.S. military since 1961.

Hasan, 42, an American-born Muslim who acted as his own defense lawyer, told mental health evaluators he wanted to become a martyr and lawyers assisting him said he was actively seeking the death penalty, though Hasan has disputed that claim.

The trial recessed at about 3:30 p.m. CDT and was slated to resume on Tuesday with more witness testimony.

Hasan will continue to represent himself in the penalty phase. The judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, has repeatedly reminded him that military-appointed lawyers can represent him but he has declined.

Hasan was convicted of opening fire on unarmed soldiers weeks before he was to be deployed to Afghanistan. He admitted in his opening statement to being the shooter, saying he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war on Islam.

Twelve of the dead were active-duty soldiers and one retired. Of the 31 wounded, 30 were soldiers and one a police officer. Hasan was also charged for shooting at another police officer and missing.

A death sentence by Hasan's jury would trigger a lengthy process requiring the approval of the Fort Hood commanding general, and the president of the United States, in order for there to be an execution.

If he is sentenced to death, Hasan would become the sixth man on death row at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, a maximum security facility for military prisoners.

Specialist Hunt's mother described seeing the two uniformed military officers arrive at her home. Anticipating what they were going to tell her about her son, she said she quickly telephoned her daughter before they could speak so her daughter too could hear the news.

"I laid the cell phone on the table, and I told them, 'Go ahead,'" Gale Hunt testified. Then, she added, "I could hear my daughter screaming on the phone, but I couldn't answer her."



headline: Father fears 2007 movie inspired missing son to flee into Oregon woods
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
1:08am EDT

An Arizona teenager who appears to have vanished into the remote woods of Oregon may have been inspired by the 2007 movie "Into the Wild," based on the true story of a young man who ventured into the Alaskan wilderness and died there, his father said on Sunday.

Missing 18-year-old Johnathan Croom's 2000 Honda CRV was found a week ago on a road near the small town of Riddle, Oregon, with his identification and money inside it, his father, David Croom, said in a telephone interview from a search site.

The father said he became concerned that his son may have gone missing after he failed to return last Monday to resume classes at Mesa Community College in Arizona, after driving to visit a friend in Washington state.

Croom said his son sent a text message to a friend more than a week ago saying: "I'm going adventuring."

Croom described his son as a happy young man with an electric smile who had - in the past six months - grown fascinated by the true story of Christopher McCandless.

In the early 1990s, McCandless, a recent college graduate, embarked on a cross-continental journey, discarding his possessions and living in the rugged Alaskan wilderness, where he eventually died of starvation.

McCandless' story was made famous by "Into the Wild," a best-selling non-fiction book by adventure writer Jon Krakauer, published in 1996, that was made into a popular movie.

The Douglas County Sheriff's Office found Croom's car on Wednesday. David Croom, who is in Riddle to help in the search for his son, said residents there told him they'd noticed the abandoned vehicle as early as last weekend.

Dwes Hutson, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, declined to comment on the case.

Croom said he had searched along remote roads for his son after getting a tip from a logger who said he had seen a young man with "the most amazing grin" walking with a woman two days earlier. Croom said he didn't know who the woman might have been.

Private search groups and individuals have volunteered to help look for the missing teenager, including one group that offered to send in drones and horses.

Aside from a stint with the Boy Scouts of America, Croom said his son had little outdoors experience.

"He doesn't really have the skill set for this," he said.

Croom said his son had split up with his girlfriend a few weeks ago and that may have been weighing on his mind.

Croom described his son as 6'1" and weighing 140 pounds. He has brown hair and brown eyes and may be carrying a multicolored backpack.

Croom said he was unaware of his son's fascination with McCandless' journey until after he went missing.

"The problem I have with that movie is that several kids have tried to emulate it, and what he was doing was dangerous," said Croom. "The guy in the movie doesn't make it."



headline: Yosemite wildfire grows, fueling dangerous winds
byline: By Laila Kearney
1:08am EDT

A colossal wildfire raging on the edge of Yosemite National Park has produced dangerous weather patterns by fueling thunderous pyrocumulus clouds that can alter the wind direction rapidly, potentially trapping firefighters, forest officials said on Sunday.

The so-called Rim Fire grew to 134,000 acres by early Sunday morning, up 9,000 acres from the day before, with smoke columns rising more than 30,000 feet, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Dick Fleishman.

"That's a real watch-out situation for our firefighters when they see that kind of activity, they know that the wind could actually move that fire right back on them," Fleishman said. "That's been happening every afternoon."

The fire was threatening power and water supplies to San Francisco, about 200 miles to the west, and scorched part of Yosemite, a park known for its waterfalls, giant sequoia groves and other scenic wonders.

Started on August 17 in the Stanislaus National Forest, the fire remained largely unchecked with extreme terrain and increased wind hampering efforts at containment, Yosemite National Park spokesman Tom Medema said. Seven percent of the wildfire is now contained, he said.

The fire blackened just over 12,000 acres in the northwest corner of Yosemite by Sunday, up marginally from the day before, consuming brush, oaks and pines and threatened some giant sequoia trees in the park, Medema said.

Officials have closed parts of the park's northwestern edge throughout the week, including the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir area, Lake Eleanor, Lake Cherry and the Tuolumne and Merced giant sequoia groves.

The fire by Sunday burned within 3 miles of the reservoir and was still 20 miles from Yosemite Valley, the park's main tourist center, Medema said. About 2,700 firefighters were expected to be on the front lines on Sunday to fight the fire.

Officials said they have no plans to shut down the entire park or its top attractions.

California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday declared a state of emergency for San Francisco, saying the fire had damaged the electrical infrastructure serving the city and forced the Public Utilities Commission to shut down power lines.

The Hetch Hetchy Reservoir provides water to 2.6 million customers in the San Francisco area and Brown in his declaration said the city's water supply could be affected if the blaze harms the reservoir, most likely by contaminating its water with ash.

There was no evidence of ash in the reservoir by Saturday evening, said Tyrone Jue, spokesman for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.

San Francisco could draw on water from neighbors if the supply is compromised, he said.

DROUGHT-PARCHED WEST

Yosemite, one of the nation's major tourist destinations, attracted nearly 4 million visitors last year. The park has been posting updates and alerts on its website. (<a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>)

The blaze in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains is now the fastest-moving of 50 large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West. The blazes have strained resources and prompted fire managers to open talks with Pentagon commanders and Canadian officials about possible reinforcements.

A 111,000-acre fire near the resort town of Sun Valley in central Idaho was 82 percent contained on Sunday as the number of firefighters assigned to the blaze was reduced to several hundred from a high of 1,800, officials said.

At its height a week ago, the blaze forced the evacuation of 2,250 homes in upscale developments in a scenic river valley known for a world-class ski resort and for premier hiking and biking trails that wind through the Sawtooth Mountains.

The Rim Fire had destroyed 11 homes, 12 outbuildings and four commercial properties by Sunday.

Evacuation advisories were lifted for roughly 2,500 residences in two Tuolumne County communities on Saturday, but at least 2,000 households were under evacuation advisories, Fleishman said.

Highway 120, one of four access routes to Yosemite, was temporarily closed. The highway leads to the west side of the 750,000-acre (300,000-hectare) national park.

The 2013 fire season has already drained U.S. Forest Service fire suppression and emergency funds, causing the agency to redirect $600 million meant for other projects like campground and trail maintenance and thinning of trees to reduce wildfire risks, agency spokesman Mike Ferris has said.



headline: U.S. spy agency edges into the light after Snowden revelations
byline: By Tabassum Zakaria
1:08am EDT

There was a time when the U.S. National Security Agency was so secretive that government officials dared not speak its name in public. NSA, the joke went, stood for "No Such Agency."

That same agency this month held an on-the-record conference call with reporters, issued a lengthy press release to rebut a newspaper story, and posted documents on a newly launched open website - icontherecord.tumblr.com (which stands for intelligence community on the record).

The steps were taken under pressure as President Barack Obama's administration tries to calm a public storm over disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that the surveillance agency and its British counterpart scoop up far more Internet and phone data than previously known.

The NSA's moves out of the shadows were meant to show that it operates lawfully and fixes mistakes when they are detected, but not everyone is convinced that it is a fundamental shift toward more openness at the intelligence agencies.

Some steps toward openness were unprecedented.

The government for the first time released opinions - previously labeled Top Secret - from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which never publicly airs its decisions on the electronic eavesdropping and communications collection by the NSA.

The move came despite resistance from some Justice Department lawyers and some NSA and CIA officials concerned about the amount of unredacted material going public in the three FISA Court opinions released, U.S. sources told Reuters.

In the end, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made the decision on how much material was released from the previously secret court opinions.

"There is no disagreement across the community with regard to whether or not we need to be more transparent and it is just a question of determining how far we can safely go," Shawn Turner, DNI spokesman, said.

Obama and other officials have said the NSA surveillance programs are lawful, have been approved by Congress and the FISA Court, and are aimed at detecting and disrupting terrorist plots.

The FISA court said the NSA may unintentionally have collected as many as 56,000 emails of Americans a year from 2008 to 2011 and may have violated the Constitution before adjustments were made.

Some analysts said intelligence agencies had not necessarily entered a brand new world of public displays of information.

"I wouldn't call it a seismic shift towards a greater transparency. The federal government put these documents out under duress," said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.

"The problem is they just keep releasing materials bit by bit and so the scandal never goes away."

Recent efforts by U.S. intelligence agencies to appear more open follow earlier comments by top-level officials that in hindsight raised questions of veracity.

Clapper was asked at a congressional hearing in March whether the NSA collected any type of data on millions of Americans to which he responded: "No sir."

After the Snowden revelations were published in June, Clapper told NBC his response at the hearing had been given in the "most truthful, or least untruthful, manner."

General Keith Alexander, director of the NSA, told Reuters in May that the agency had no interest in reading the emails of U.S. citizens, and quipped: "The great irony is we're the only ones not spying on the American people."

Government officials are loath to say that Snowden's disclosures prompted greater openness, but analysts say it did have an effect.

"The amount of knowledge that people now have about what NSA does means that we can't simply pretend it doesn't exist. That's where Snowden changed things," said James Lewis, a senior fellow, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

To make the disclosed NSA programs palatable to the public, more openness is required, he said. "There is a link between transparency and accountability and political acceptance."

Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the organization was pleased with the recent release of documents and hoped the government would release more in the coming weeks.

But it should not be viewed as a huge shift toward transparency by the administration, said Jaffer, whose group has also sued the federal government for more information on its use of unmanned drones.

"In fact, on the same day the president promised more transparency on surveillance issues, the CIA filed a brief in one of our 'targeted killing' cases arguing that it could not release legal memos about the drone program, could not release civilian casualty numbers, and for that matter could not even acknowledge that the agency had played any role in targeted killings," Jaffer said.

boyfriend.

Judge Sherry Stephens had been expected to decide on a date for the new penalty phase for Arias over the 2008 murder of Travis Alexander, who was found dead in his shower in a Phoenix suburb, shot in the face and stabbed multiple times with his throat slashed.

Arias was found guilty of the murder in May after a sensational trial that drew national attention with its tale of a soft-spoken young woman accused of such a brutal crime.

But the same jury that convicted her then deadlocked on whether she should be put to death or sentenced to life in prison, and prosecutors are seeking a penalty phase retrial.

At a hearing last month, the judge said she hoped to start jury selection anew in late September. But on Monday, she postponed setting a date to start the process of impaneling a new jury until at least mid-September, when she set another status hearing in the case.

In postponing setting a date, the judge said she needed to deal with pending legal filings in the case.

State prosecutors had previously asked in court filings for the penalty phase to start on July 30. Defense attorneys sought to delay the proceedings until January due to scheduling conflicts and the possibility that Arias might want to call witnesses to speak on her behalf.

Prosecutors have the option of retrying the sentencing phase of the trial, which would require a new jury. If there is another deadlock in the next sentencing phase, a judge would sentence Arias to life in prison, or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.

Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery will continue to seek the death penalty for Arias, a spokesman said on Friday.

The five-month trial, which began in January, was packed with graphic testimony, bloody photographs and sexual situations.

Arias, 33, took the stand for 18 days and maintained throughout that the killing was in self-defense despite fierce cross-examination by prosecutors.

1:08am EDT

Muriel Siebert, the first woman to own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, has died of complications from cancer, Leonard Leiman, a director at her firm Siebert Financial Corp., said on Sunday. She was 80.

The founder and president of Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. Inc, Siebert purchased her seat on the exchange in 1967, nearly a decade before the next woman would join her there.

Despite credentials including partnerships at two leading brokerages and the founding of her namesake firm, Siebert's initial attempt to gain a seat on exchange was met with sharp opposition and even ridicule by much of its all-male membership, according to her official biography on her company's website. She eventually prevailed.

Known as "Mickie," Siebert made another bold move in 1975, transforming her firm to into a discount brokerage on the first day that New York Stock Exchange members were allowed to negotiate their commissions.

"Mickie was a pioneer and recognized as a leader throughout the financial services industry and beyond," Joseph Ramos, Siebert Financial's chief operating officer, said in a statement. "She was respected as a strong voice of integrity, reason and sound business practices."

Siebert later became the first woman to serve as Superintendent of Banking for the State of New York, accepting the appointment by Governor Hugh Carey in 1977.

An outspoken champion of women and minorities in industry and government, Siebert made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in 1982, losing in the Republican primary to state lawmaker Florence Sullivan.

Sullivan went on to lose to Daniel Patrick Moynihan.



headline: Chicago students begin new term with fewer teachers, schools

largest school system makes do with fewer buildings.

More than 30,000 children on Monday will be directly or indirectly affected by the public school closures - either because they have to go to a new school or because their school is absorbing students from a shuttered building.

The system eliminated 1,581 teaching positions and 1,587 non-teaching positions this summer, but has hired back 1,000 teachers for the school year.

Chicago Public Schools officials have said the cuts to staff and the largest mass school closings in the nation were necessary to help stem a mounting deficit forecast at a record $1 billion in 2014. About a third of the teacher cuts were from closing schools.

The closings have affected mainly Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods. Parents and union leaders have protested, saying more children will have to cross gang territorial lines, leaving them potentially exposed to violence in a city that recorded 506 homicides in 2012.

Chicago Public Schools have hired 1,200 "safe passage" workers to staff school routes to make sure children arrive safely. This summer, there have been three reported homicides along or near those safe-school routes.

In remarks to reporters Monday morning, Mayor Rahm Emanuel spoke of the improvements to the system, including a full day for all kindergarten students.

"Obviously, kids are excited, like any child, upset about the summer being ended, but enthusiastic about the beginning of a new school year," Emanuel said.

Yellow signs mark safe passage routes, but some parents interviewed while walking their children to John B. Drake Elementary School on Monday said they saw signs but not enough workers. Drake's building has been closed and the school now shares a building with another school.

"I don't see that many safe passage people out here at all. I feel like it's a joke," said Rubin Livingston, 28, who said he will walk his son to school himself to ensure his safety. The "safe passage" route to Drake saw a homicide over the summer.

Drake students danced their way into the first day of classes Monday, with a DJ blasting music over a sound system and saying "Welcome back to school, children."

Quaneta Gates, 40, who has a child at Drake, welcomed the new year and said she is positive the transition will work out. Asked if she had concerns about her child's school being housed in a building with children from another school, she said "Life is about new experiences and you're supposed to meet new people."

But Gates said she was disappointed she did not see more safe passage workers on nearby streets.

Union leaders contend the safe passage program is soaking up money that could be spent on social workers, counselors and nurses at schools.

"They've created a problem of student safety and are investing almost exclusively in security at the expense of programs and staff to help students who are facing all sorts of issues," said Jackson Potter, staff coordinator for the Chicago Teachers Union.

The district said that salary increases negotiated last September to settle a strike with the teachers' union contributed to the budget deficit.

Chicago Public Schools serve 403,000 students in 681 schools. But enrollment has been falling for years, in part because people have been moving out of the city with most leaving poor neighborhoods.

Urban school districts have been grappling with declining enrollment across the country, and 70 cities have closed schools over the past decade.



headline: Ohio sees resurgence in meth busts, five years after record low
byline: By Kim Palmer
4:46am EDT

Methamphetamine lab seizures in Ohio have soared more than 400 percent in the past five years, accompanied by a spike in production resulting from new ways of making small quantities of the drug in mobile laboratories, officials said on Sunday.

The sharp rise in drug busts reverses a downward trend that had followed the advent of a tougher law in 2005.

Ohio meth busts reached 635 over the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, which runs from October 1 to September 30, up from a record low 112 in 2008, according to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

Seizures had declined from a high of 444 in to 2005 following the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, which forced retailers of nonprescription products containing pseudoephedrine and other active meth ingredients to place those products behind the counter and required consumers to show identification for each purchase.

A spokeswoman for the Ohio Attorney General's Office confirmed the numbers, first reported in Sunday's Cleveland Plain Dealer.

"We're seeing a continuous spike," Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine told the Plain Dealer. "It is easier (to make the drug). We used to talk about 'meth houses,' or places people would make this. Well today, you can make it in a pop bottle."

The "one pot" or "shake and bake" method uses two-liter bottles and easily available household items.

In neighboring Michigan, those methods accounted for more than 75 percent of all meth labs, according to a 2011 Michigan State Police report.

The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which tracks drug arrests and seizure statistics by federal fiscal year, plans to have final numbers at the end of next month.

The data comes from a voluntary reporting process by law enforcement around the state and does not include many of Ohio's 88 counties, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Attorney General's office said.

The drug seizures are concentrated in a handful of Ohio counties, many of them rural. Nearly one-third of all seizures occurred in Summit County, including the city of Akron, just outside Cleveland, with 191 meth lab seizures.

The counties representing Cleveland and Columbus reported two meth lab seizures each and Cincinnati reported 11.

Nationally there were 11,210 meth labs discovered in 2012, with Ohio ranking sixth among U.S. states. It trailed Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration website.

A New Jersey man has come forward as the third and final winner of the $448 million Powerball jackpot after buying the winning ticket at a South Brunswick supermarket, New Jersey lottery officials said.

Mario Scarnici of Monmouth Junction claimed his share of the prize, which amounts to $86 million before taxes. Two of the three winning tickets in the August 7 drawing were sold in the state, according to a New Jersey Lottery statement released on Friday.

He purchased his ticket from the Super Stop &amp; Shop supermarket in South Brunswick Township.

Jose Perez, a night manager at the Stop &amp; Shop, said the winning ticket has been great for business and that employees are thrilled that the winner came forward to claim his prize.

"We were happy first of all that we sold it," said Perez in a telephone interview. "We sold a ticket before but nobody claimed it."

The store received a $30,000 bonus commission for selling the ticket, and will give that money to charity.

According to a report on the CentralJersey.com web site, Scarnici came forward with his two adult sons to claim his prize. He chose the cash option and will get about $62 million after taxes.

Members of a group of 16 Ocean County maintenance workers with a winning ticket will each receive about $3.8 million after taxes. The group, known as Ocean's 16, bought the Powerball numbers at the Acme Markets in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey.

Scarnici could not be reached for comment, nor could a representative for the state lottery.

Paul White, an engineer from Ham Lake, Minnesota, was the other winner.

The odds of winning the jackpot were about one in 175 million.



headline: Four thousand run from the bulls in Virginia event
byline: By Gary Robertson
1:08am EDT

mile dirt track on Saturday in rural Virginia's version of the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain.

It was the first event of what promoters say will be a national, 10-city bull-running tour modeled on the annual Pamplona event.

"I just didn't want to die, to get trampled by bulls and die," said Cat Jones, 22, who works in engineering and traveled from New York City for the run.

"It was a rush ... a shot of adrenalin," she said.

Jones had such a thrill dodging bulls and watching them race by at breakneck speed that she paid $30 to run again in the afternoon.

The first six runs were conducted with about 500 runners each, chased by 12 bulls, and the last run featured 24 bulls chasing about 700 runners.

About 8,000 people came to watch the runs, said Rob Dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of the Boston-based Great Bull Run. Most of those who signed up were 18 to 40 years old, and about 40 percent were women.

Two runners were taken to the hospital with concussion-like symptoms, according to Great Bull Run. One other runner saw a medic after being knocked down and stepped on by other participants.

Every participant in the race had to sign a waiver, absolving the organizers of liability in case of injury.

Dickens said it was "doing something dangerous and living to tell the tale" that draws participants to the event.

"I wanted to test myself," said Laurie Blaha, 27, of Richmond, Virginia..

Blaha said she passed the test, conquering the fear and nervousness she had before the bulls ran onto the track.

"It was exhilarating," Blaha said. "I would definitely do it again."

Dickens said the only major problem came on the first run of the day, when the initial group of six bulls stopped about midway down the dirt course.

They didn't start running again until six additional bulls were let out of the gates. Dickens said they apparently did not have the confidence to run alone, and needed more company.

After that, he said the staff overseeing the bulls began sending 12 bulls at a time.

In nearly all the runs held during the day, the bulls started slowly and then quickly accelerated to a stampede-like pace.

The Virginia run was set on the grounds of the Virginia Motorsport Park, a drag strip south of Richmond.

Animals rights groups, such as PETA, have protested the Great Bull Run, saying the events puts stress on the animals.

Dickens has said the bulls are not harmed and has invited anyone observing someone abusing the animals to report it.

The next Great Bull Run is scheduled for October 19 in Atlanta. Other cities on the nationwide tour include Houston, Tampa and Los Angeles.



headline: Judge to rule on San Bernardino bankruptcy, pensions loom
byline: By Tim Reid
4:46am EDT

an important test for the federal law used by Detroit and other U.S. cities burdened by pension payment costs.

Most observers expect federal bankruptcy judge Meredith Jury to rule that cash-strapped San Bernardino, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, is eligible for Chapter 9 protection, a year after it declared bankruptcy having effectively run out of cash to meet its day-to-day obligations.

A city of just 240,000, San Bernardino could be a precursor for what is shaping up as a central issue in the far bigger bankruptcy case of Detroit: whether an insolvent city can cut already-promised pensions for its workers and pay less into its public retirement funds.

In an unprecedented move, San Bernardino halted its biweekly payments to the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) for an entire year after declaring bankruptcy last August.

San Bernardino has now resumed payments to Calpers, America's biggest pension fund and San Bernardino's largest creditor, but no city has ever halted employer payments to Calpers before. The $260 billion pension fund is the only party objecting to San Bernardino's bankruptcy, saying that pension funds should not be treated like other creditors. Calpers may appeal the eligibility decision.

In Detroit, which last month filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, estimated at $18.5 billion, the state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, has already called for cuts to current and future pension benefits in any bankruptcy plan. Unions representing workers have objected to the bankruptcy by arguing that it contravenes benefits' protection enshrined in Michigan's state constitution.

LIKE A LAB TEST FOR DETROIT

In both San Bernardino and Detroit, the idea of cutting back pension payments has set up a high-stakes battle between Wall Street bondholders and state pension funds over how they are treated when cities run out of money - an issue that could eventually find its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

"There is a real parallel between San Bernardino and Detroit," said Michael Sweet, a bankruptcy attorney with Fox Rothschild in San Francisco, who is not representing any party in the San Bernardino or Detroit cases.

"Both cities have shown an appetite to take the pension issue head-on. If the judge rules San Bernardino eligible for bankruptcy, it opens the way for the city to propose a plan that could impair Calpers - which could put this little city ahead of what is happening in Detroit."

Calpers has taken the opposite stance in the case of Stockton, another California city, which was found eligible for bankruptcy in April. Stockton has kept current on all payments to the pension fund.

The judge overseeing the Stockton case has said that the question of whether Calpers remains to be paid in full under a bankruptcy plan could become an important issue when the city presents its exit plan.

James Spiotto, a municipal bankruptcy specialist and a partner at Chapman &amp; Cutler in Chicago, said the issue for San Bernardino - and other cities in bankruptcy - is simple: it comes down to what they can feasibly pay creditors under a bankruptcy plan.

"If San Bernardino has to pay everything it owes to Calpers - can they survive as a municipality?"



headline: Former head of failed Alaska dairy indicted for fraud
byline: By Yereth Rosen
12:12am EDT

The head of a defunct Alaska dairy that was created partly with the assets of a public dairy under the oversight of former Gov. Sarah Palin has been indicted for allegedly bilking the state for $430,000 in fraudulent agricultural loans.

Karen Olson of Wasilla, former chief executive of the now-defunct Matanuska Creamery, was indicted on Friday by a federal grand jury on three counts of wire fraud, plus mail fraud and making false statements to influence the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Olson's indictment came eight months after her former business partner, Kyle Beus, was accused in a federal court indictment of defrauding the Agriculture Department of $643,000 in agricultural grants that prosecutors said in part went to personal purposes rather than the faltering dairy.

The Matanuska Creamery in Palmer, Alaska, opened in 2008, in large part from assets of the state-owned Matanuska Maid dairy that went out of business in 2007. The private creamery received several government loans and grants before shutting down at the end of 2012.

Although Olson and Beus were business partners and the , charges against the two are similar, the cases are separate, Assistant U.S. Attorney Retta Randall said. Beus is scheduled to go to trial in September in Anchorage federal court.

If convicted, Olson faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine, Randall said.

Palin was not implicated in the criminal case, Randall said, although the collapse of the Matanuska Creamery is considered a blot on her gubernatorial record.

Palin was governor when the dairy, which was then owned by the state, announced plans to go out of business in 2007 and she fired its board and replaced it with a new one. Palin approved state grants to keep the dairy in business but it failed and many of its assets went to create a new private dairy. That dairy failed last year.

Palin's Alaska critics accused her of botched management and of favoring her Wasilla-area friends over experienced business people. Palin said at the time her goal was to ensure a smooth privatization to keep local dairy farmers in business.

Beus' attorney could not be reached immediately for comment and public court documents did not list an attorney for Olson.



headline: U.S. authorities probe killing of grizzly bear near Yellowstone
byline: By Laura and Zuckerman
12:12am EDT

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is investigating the killing of a grizzly bear near Yellowstone National Park in eastern Idaho, not far from where a grizzly attacked two biologists this month, state wildlife officials said on Saturday.

It is generally illegal to kill grizzlies in the 48 contiguous states, where the bears are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. But the law does allow the animals to be killed if they are threatening humans.

The caretaker of a residence near the park shot the grizzly on Friday night, said Gregg Losinski, regional conservation educator with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.

The caretaker was armed with a high-powered rifle while at the home because a grizzly had previously torn down a bird feeder on the property and eaten the seeds, Losinski said.

State wildlife biologists have collected tissue samples from the bear for DNA testing to compare with fur taken from a site nearby where a grizzly startled from sleep charged and bit two biologists on August 15.

Also on that day, a mother grizzly attacked and wounded two hikers who unexpectedly encountered the bear's cub, park officials said.

Grizzly and human conflicts happen mostly in the autumn when the bears are driven to seek food in order to bulk up before hibernation, said Losinski.

About 600 bears roam Yellowstone and its border states of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.



headline: In bustling Houston, it's a case of 'Build, baby, build!'
byline: By Anna Driver and Ilaina Jonas
12:12am EDT

With Texas one of the few bright spots in the U.S. economy, the skyline of swaggering Houston is where the action is as builders and global oil companies, from Phillips 66 to Exxon Mobil Corp, look past previous busts and spend billions on gleaming new buildings.

The U.S. shale oil and gas revolution - which has already changed industries from railroads to pipelines and refineries - is helping drive the voracious appetite for office space needed for the expanding workforce in the world's energy capital.

Demand is so hot that Houston is one of the few places where banks - including Wells Fargo &amp; Co, which is seen as one of the more conservative big banks - will loan money for a new building without demanding developers first have a tenant.

"Houston is booming and bar none the strongest market in the United States of America," said Joseph Sitt, chief executive of Thor Equities, which has two projects underway in Houston.

There are some 56 office buildings totaling at least 11 million square feet under construction in and around Houston, according to real estate services firm CBRE Group Inc. That is equivalent to 190 football fields.

In the forested suburbs, Exxon has what it calls "one of the largest commercial construction projects underway in North America." The nearly 400-acre campus with 20 buildings will have enough room for 10,000 employees.

With crude now above $100 a barrel, money is flowing freely. And while the shale oil and gas transformation means North America may be energy independent by the end of this decade, economists are wary when people say this boom will be different. They counsel caution.

"The Texas oil and gas industry is not known for long periods of stability," Karr Ingham, economist for the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers. "Nobody wants what happened (in past busts) to happen again."

To be sure, the amount of space being built is still only a fraction of the 88.9 million square feet developers constructed in Houston from 1980 through 1986, a flurry that more than doubled the city's office market, according to real estate research firm Reis Inc.

The Texas economy grew 4.8 percent last year, the fastest pace among the big U.S. states. New workers are pouring into Houston, which needs new offices for the 100,000 jobs it added last year. Houston is on track to add another 80,000 this year.

But over-exuberance about real estate and oil have afflicted Houston before. In the early 1980s developers built a 71-story green glass tower with a footprint shaped like a dollar sign.

It took nearly two decades to recover from Houston's big crash in the 1980s, which was brought on by a collapse in oil prices. Vacancy rates soared to near 30 percent in 1983 from 9.8 percent two years prior, according to Reis.

The current building cycle is in large part propelled by burgeoning domestic production of oil and natural gas unlocked from shale formations through hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.

"If you are investing in Houston, you're a believer in the energy sector long term, which we are," said Russell Cooper, managing director of capital transactions at Shorenstein Properties LLC in San Francisco.

The firm in January bought a building of more than one million square feet in downtown Houston from Exxon for $48 million. It plans to put a new glass skin on the building and may connect it to the air-conditioned tunnel system downtown, where office workers eat and shop to escape torrential rains and steamy heat.

Exxon has put two other buildings in Houston and one in Virginia up for sale, ahead of the move to its new campus.

ENERGY CORRIDOR

Tower cranes dot the landscape of Houston's so-called energy corridor, about 15 miles from downtown. The area, located on the western edge of the city, is experiencing rapid growth as companies build and expand. There, refining company Phillips 66 is constructing a 14-acre campus with over a million square feet for its 1,800 employees.

Firms are loading their blueprints with plans for everything from basketball courts to childcare centers and fancy coffee shops to attract hard-to-find energy experts.

Near the Exxon campus, an entire master-planned community called Springwoods Village with room for up to 5,000 houses and apartments is going up to accommodate new workers.

While others construct facilities for employees, some companies are building space to push the frontiers of oil technology.

BP Plc is spending more than $100 million over the next five years to build a new three-story building that will house the huge supercomputing complex used to speed up BP's search for oil and gas around the world.

"It made more sense to create a new home," said Keith Gray, manager of BP's High Performance Computing unit. "It became clear that a freestanding building was needed to address growth needs."

Other oil and gas companies with buildings under construction or in preliminary stages in Houston include BHP Billiton Petroleum, Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron Corp, which plans a 50-story tower downtown.

One building which started on spec - meaning banks loan money for construction even if a tenant isn't lined up - is the 550,000-square-foot Energy Center Three in west Houston.

Principal Real Estate Investors, part of Principal Financial Group, and developer Trammell Crow Co started the building with a loan of roughly $100 million from a Wells Fargo-led syndicate.

Within four months, oil company ConocoPhillips signed a lease for the entire building and half of Energy Center Four, which is not yet under construction, said Aaron Thielhorn, managing director of Trammell Crow's Houston business unit.

Brian Stoffers, president of CBRE Capital Markets, said spec building in Houston in many ways makes it an outlier.

"The dynamics of the Houston market are so robust right now that it's the exception to the economic rule around the rest of the country," he said.

Of the buildings under construction, 29 will be rentals that will not be owner-occupied. Of those, 13 broke ground without signed leases but six of those have since found tenants.

Vacancy rates in the most expensive, modern office buildings in Houston are tumbling. Second-quarter vacancy slid to 6.9 percent from 12 percent in the same period two years ago, according to CBRE. The broader office vacancy rate is 14.2 percent versus a national average of 17 percent.

DANGER AHEAD?

While access to shale deposits has diminished worries about supplies, much of the new demand for crude oil in recent years has been led by developing nations such as China and India.

Big slowdowns in those developing economies could hit the price of crude and cool enthusiasm for building in Houston.

"If China and India have hit a plateau, then I think we have to ask where are the drivers for oil demand in the future," said the University of Houston's Robert Gilmer.

Chinese growth slowed to 7.5 percent in the second quarter - below the 8.9 percent average of the last six years.

Apart from shale, crude oil prices generally need to stay above $65 per barrel to produce from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico or the oilsands in Canada for companies to make money.

Another risk is overbuilding. Houston, a sprawling 8,778-square-mile metropolis, has no zoning restrictions, a fact that has some investors including New York-based GreenOak Real Estate Advisors, looking elsewhere to buy.

Owners in areas where building is constrained can reap big rewards when demand for space rises, fueling rent spikes of sometimes 20 percent. That rarely happens in Houston, where developers can easily build.

"When you're dealing with a market like Houston, there's nothing to hold developers back," Ryan Severino, Reis senior economist said. "You can literally can go next door and put up a building."

Hannah Anderson, the Southern California teenager whose alleged abductor authorities say killed her mother and brother, wiped away tears on Saturday at a memorial service for her slain family.

Some 250 people attended the service for Christina Anderson, 44, and her son Ethan, 8, at the Guardian Angels Roman Catholic Church about 20 miles east of San Diego.

It was held two weeks after a multi-state search for Anderson, 16, and her suspected kidnapper, James Lee DiMaggio, 40, ended at a mountain lake in the Idaho wilderness, where an FBI agent shot and killed DiMaggio.

Police say that, before driving off with Hannah, the family friend-turned-abductor lured Christina Anderson and Ethan to his home in Boulevard near San Diego and killed them.

Their bodies were discovered on August 4 in the wreckage of the property, which DiMaggio is believed to have set ablaze with the aid of a timer.

"Ethan was a handsome little guy with spirit, the kind of guy you'd want for a son, a brother, a friend," the boy's great-uncle, Dave Braun, told those in attendance.

Braun described Christina Anderson as a "wonderful mother and friend" who was always ready to help people. "We will miss them forever and always think of them," he said.

The Anderson family lived in Lakeside near San Diego.

The slayings and kidnapping made national headlines and triggered one of the most widespread Amber Alerts in the history of the system used to notify motorists of a kidnapping.

DiMaggio and Anderson were photographed in his car at 12:10 a.m. on August 4, some 20 hours before DiMaggio's house went up in flames. Anderson later told NBC News in an interview that aired on "Today" that DiMaggio had picked her up the previous day from her cheerleading camp.

"Our prayers were answered for the safe return of Hannah and true justice was served that day by the FBI," Braun said. "Now we turn our thoughts to healing."

Authorities have not publicly discussed any possible motives for DiMaggio's alleged actions. Braun told reporters that DiMaggio had developed an apparent infatuation with the high school student that had made Hannah uncomfortable.

Braun noted that it was particularly troubling that his niece and great-nephew were killed by a close family friend.

"We are still shocked by that," Braun said. "We are concerned now about Hannah and how she'll recover from this."



headline: Four thousand run from the bulls in Virginia event
byline: By Gary Robertson
1:08am EDT

mile dirt track on Saturday in rural Virginia's version of the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain.

It was the first event of what promoters say will be a nationwide, 10-city bull-running tour modeled on the annual Pamplona event.

"I just didn't want to die, to get trampled by bulls and die," said Cat Jones, 22, who works in engineering and traveled from New York City for the run.

"It was a rush ... a shot of adrenalin," she said.

Jones had such a thrill dodging bulls and watching them race by at break-neck speed that she paid $30 to run again in the afternoon.

The first six runs were conducted with about 500 runners each, chased by 12 bulls, and the last run featured 24 bulls chasing about 700 runners.

About 8,000 people came to watch the runs, said Rob Dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of the Boston-based Great Bull Run. Most of those who signed up were 18 to 40 years old, and about 40 percent were women.

At least one runner suffered an injury that required a trip to a hospital. Another went to see a medic after being knocked down and stepped on by other runners.

Every participant in the race had to sign a waiver, absolving the organizers of liability should they be injured.

Dickens said it was "doing something dangerous and living to tell the tale" that draws participants to the event.

That was what drew Laurie Blaha, 27, of Richmond, Virginia. "I wanted to test myself," she said.

Blaha said she passed the test, conquering the fear and nervousness she had before the bulls ran onto the track.

"It was exhilarating," Blaha said. "I would definitely do it again."

Dickens said the only major problem came on the first run of the day, when the initial group of six bulls stopped about midway down the quarter-mile dirt course.

They didn't start running again until six additional bulls were let out of the gates. Dickens said they apparently didn't have the confidence to run alone, and needed more company.

After that, he said the staff overseeing the bulls began sending 12 bulls at a time.

In nearly all the runs held during the day, the bulls started slowly and then quickly accelerated to a stampede-like pace.

The Virginia run was set on the grounds of the Virginia Motorsport Park, a drag strip south of Richmond that offered spectators State Fair food such as fried Oreos and foot-long corn dogs.

Animals rights groups, such as PETA, have protested the Great Bull Run, saying the events puts stress on the animals.

Dickens has said the bulls are not harmed and has invited anyone observing someone abusing the animals to report it.

The next Great Bull Run is scheduled for October 19 in Atlanta. Other cities on the nationwide tour include Houston, Tampa and Los Angeles.

sex couples the right to wed.

The New Mexico decision ended a lawsuit filed by two men, Alex Hanna and Yon Hudson, after they were refused a marriage license by the clerk of Santa Fe County earlier this year.

"It is the first time that a judge in New Mexico has determined that the constitution and laws of New Mexico require marriage equality," said Brian Egolf, a lawyer and state legislator who represented Hanna and Hudson. "We're very excited for our clients."

Thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage.

In her ruling, which was issued late Thursday, District Judge Sarah Singleton said there was nothing in New Mexico's law or constitution prohibiting same-sex marriage.

She ordered the Santa Fe county clerk, Geraldine Salazar, to begin issuing licenses to same-sex couples or appear in court to explain why she shouldn't have to.

On Friday, Salazar complied. She said she had always supported gay marriage, but feared that the licenses would be considered illegal.

"I am a fervent supporter of same-sex marriage in New Mexico and have always believed that the restrictive and antiquated statutes in our state must fall to the principles of equal protection embodied in our constitution," Salazar said in a statement Friday.

Couples began gathering in her office Friday afternoon, amid cheers, laughter, tears and hugs.

In 2004, the county clerk in Sandoval County, New Mexico, began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but stopped doing so after the state attorney general said gay marriage was not legal in New Mexico.

The case that prompted this week's ruling was one of several filed recently in New Mexico on the question of same-sex marriage. The state Supreme Court was initially asked to rule on them, but asked lower courts to handle them first.

Two women who sued in one of the other suits, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, were also married on Friday with a license issued in Santa Fe by Salazar.

Jen Roper and Angelique Neuman were married in the Christus St. Vincent cancer center where Roper was undergoing treatment, the ACLU said in a press release.

"We are so very happy to be officially married after 21 years together," Roper said in a statement. "Now we just ask that the courts move quickly to ensure that our marriages are fully recognized and respected by the state."

A county clerk in southern New Mexico had already begun issuing licenses in advance of the ruling.

"Maybe I'm jumping the gun, but so be it," said Do単a Ana County Clerk Lynn Ellins on Wednesday. "Equal protection should apply to everyone."

headline: Lawyer for George Zimmerman chides him for visiting gun factory
byline: By Barbara Liston
12:12am EDT

George Zimmerman's lawyer has chided him for visiting a Florida firearms factory that makes the type of gun he used to kill unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin last year.

Zimmerman in July was acquitted of murder in Martin's death in a racially charged case that polarized the U.S. public and raised questions about Florida's loose gun laws and equal justice.

"We understand how George visiting the factory that produces the gun used to shoot Trayvon Martin is seen as inappropriate," Shawn Vincent, spokesman for Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara, told Reuters on Friday.

Celebrity news website TMZ posted a photo of Zimmerman at the Kel-Tec plant in Cocoa, shaking hands with an employee and grinning.

The website reported that he asked questions about the legality of buying a Kel-Tec KSG, a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun.

Zimmerman, 29, shot Martin, who was 17 years old, in the heart with a 9mm Kel-Tec pistol.

Zimmerman was a volunteer watchman for a gated community in central Florida when he killed Martin in February 2012.

Martin was walking back to the town house where he was staying after a trip to a nearby convenience store to buy Skittles candy and a can of iced tea.

Prosecutors argued that Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, profiled Martin as a criminal, pursued him and killed him. Zimmerman said Martin attacked him and that he acted in self-defense.

Less than three weeks after his acquittal, Zimmerman was stopped for speeding on a Texas highway 25 miles southeast of Dallas, and notified the officer that he was carrying a gun in his glove compartment, according to Texas officials.



headline: Fifty years later, U.S. marchers urge fulfillment of King's 'dream'
byline: By Doug Palmer and Ian Simpson
1:08am EDT

Tens of thousands of marchers converged on Washington on Saturday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech and to urge action on jobs, voting rights and gun violence.

"We believe in a new America. It's time to march for a new America," civil rights leader Al Sharpton told the predominantly black crowd from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

Sharpton and other speakers paid tribute to King and other civil rights leaders for progress over the past five decades that led to significant gains, including Barack Obama's election as the first black U.S. president.

But the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida last year and the Supreme Court's recent decision to strike down a portion of the nation's voting rights law showed the struggle was not over, they said.

"King saw the possibility of an Obama 50 years ago. The world is made of dreamers that change reality because of their dream. And what we must do is we must give our young people dreams again," Sharpton said.

The "National Action to Realize the Dream" was led by Sharpton and Martin Luther King III, King's oldest son.

"We ain't going to let nobody turn us around. We're going to keep marching down to freedom land," King told the crowd. "I know that Daddy is smiling up above knowing that your presence here today will assure the fulfillment of his dream."

Organizers expected 100,000 people to attend the rally and march from the Lincoln Memorial in the National Mall to the Washington Monument, passing by the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial.

The National Park Service does not make crowd estimates and organizers did not immediately respond to request for their own.

Under a bright blue sky, a huge throng of people crowded both sides of the 2,000-foot-long (610-metre) reflecting pool east of the Lincoln Memorial.

More than 40 groups participated in the march, among them the Service Employees International Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Federation of Teachers. It aimed to call attention to job opportunities, voting rights, gun violence, women's rights and immigration reform.

Despite big gains politically and in education, nearly half of those who responded to a poll by the Pew Research Center in Washington, think far more needs to be done to achieve the color-blind society that King envisioned.

King was among six organizers of the 1963 march, and led about 250,000 people to the Lincoln Memorial and delivered his "I have a dream" speech from its steps.

'SO MUCH HATE'

The speech and march helped spur passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act in 1964 and 1965, respectively.

King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. He was assassinated on April 4, 1968 at age 39.

That is still a bitter memory for Velma Lois Jones, an 82-year-old former math teacher from Memphis, Tennessee, who participated in the first march 50 years ago and was back on Saturday to help keep King's dream alive.

"I was down at the Mason Temple where he was going to speak that night, waiting for him to come, when I got the news. And it was a devastation," Jones said.

"We've got so much hate in this country that eradicating it will never end," she said. "But the fact that I'm here says I have hope that things are going to be better."

Obama is scheduled to speak on Wednesday at a ceremony marking the actual anniversary of the march at the Lincoln Memorial. The commemoration will include a nationwide ringing of bells at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT).

Charles Wise a 61-year-old nurse, said he traveled from Brotmanville, New Jersey with his wife for the march because "the way things are going, participation is required."

"You can't stand on the sidelines and hope things get better. You have to get out and make them get better. When they start to go after voting rights, as many of us that died for those, the answer is 'hell no,'" Wise said.

Harrison Hawkins, a retired Smithsonian museum worker who celebrated his 70th birthday this week, remembered there was far less security at the 1963 march.

While most of the crowd on Saturday was kept at a distance from the Lincoln Memorial, Hawkins said 50 years ago "you could walk around here. There wasn't anybody stopping you. I got up on the steps" to listen to King's speech.

Like others at the march, Hawkins acknowledged that black Americans have much more freedom than they did in the early 1960s and said he still marvels that a black man has become president.

"There's been a lot of changes, but there needs to be a lot more. The Congress needs to let Barack Obama do his job ... They're holding him back. They won't let him do anything just because he's a black man," Hawkins said.

Many young blacks were outraged by the Trayvon Martin case and what they see as an assault on voting rights, but said they also were worried about finding a job to pay off tens of thousands of dollars of student debt.

"Right now, I work part time, but it doesn't pay for anything," said Naada Boulandi, a 29-year-old aspiring interior designer from Silver Spring, Maryland, who graduated from college in May.

Mel Wilson, manager for social justice and human rights for the National Association of Social Workers, said that is a problem that many minorities face.

"We still deal with massive unemployment, disproportionate unemployment among black and Hispanic youth and that needs to change," the 66-year-old said.



headline: Wildfire enters Yosemite, threatens San Francisco water, power
byline: By Laila Kearney
1:08am EDT

moving wildfire raging on the edge of Yosemite National Park that is threatening power and water supplies to San Francisco about 200 miles to the west.

The so-called Rim Fire, which had grown to just over 125,000 acres as of early Saturday, remained largely unchecked with extreme terrain hampering efforts at containment.

"We are making progress but unfortunately the steep terrain definitely has posed a major challenge," said Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

"Today we're continuing to see warm weather that could allow this fire to continue to grow very rapidly as it has over the last several days," Berlant said. He described the fire as the 16th largest on record in California.

California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday declared a state of emergency, warning that the fire had damaged the electrical infrastructure serving the city, and forced the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission to shut down power lines.

There have been no reports of blackouts in San Francisco.

Ashley Taylor, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service, said high humidity and firefighting efforts through the night had helped some.

"Firefighters are still working with the same difficult situation, and they're really taking every opportunity they can to take hold of this fire," Taylor said. "They're working very hard to take this down."

The Hetch Hetchy Reservoir provides water to 2.6 million customers in the San Francisco area, and Brown in his declaration said the city's water supply could be affected if the blaze affects the reservoir.

The Hetch Hetchy watershed provides about 85 percent of San Francisco's total water needs, according to the Western Urban Water Coalition, organization of largest water suppliers in western United States.

The fire on Saturday remained about 4 miles west of the reservoir and more than 20 miles from Yosemite Valley, the park's main tourist center, Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman said.

The fire was consuming brush, oaks and pine and was about 5 percent contained as of Saturday.

The fire had blackened about 12,000 acres in the northwestern corner of Yosemite as of Friday.

Berlant said about 2,700 firefighters were expected to be on the front lines on Saturday to fight the fire, which started on August 17 in the Stanislaus National Forest.

DROUGHT PARCHED

Yosemite, one of the nation's major tourist destinations, attracted nearly 4 million visitors last year. The park has been posting updates and alerts on its website. (Alerts: <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>)

The blaze in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains is now the fastest-moving of 50 large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West that have strained resources and prompted fire managers to open talks with Pentagon commanders and Canadian officials about possible reinforcements.

Taylor said there had been one reported injury, a heat-related injury to a firefighter, due to the fire. About 4,500 residences, three commercial buildings and 1,000 outbuildings are currently threatened by the fire, she said.

An American Red Cross shelter at the Mother Lode Fairgrounds in Tuolumne County located north and west of the fire had 184 people on Saturday, spokesman Jordan Scott said.

Campers forced from Stanislaus National Forest had taken shelter there earlier in the week, but the fairgrounds shelter now had people forced to leave area homes, he said.

"People coming in are obviously concerned about their home and their situation," but their spirits have been "generally upbeat," Scott said in a telephone interview.

Taylor said there is no plan to close Yosemite National Park due to the fire. However, park officials have closed areas in its northwestern edge throughout the week, including the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir area, Lake Eleanor, Lake Cherry and Tuolumne Grove of Giant Sequoias.

Highway 120, one of four access routes to Yosemite, which is known for its waterfalls, giant sequoia groves and other scenic wonders, was temporarily closed. The highway leads to the west side of the 750,000-acre (300,000-hectare) national park.

The 2013 fire season has already drained U.S. Forest Service fire suppression and emergency funds, causing the agency to redirect $600 million meant for other projects like campground and trail maintenance and thinning of trees to reduce wildfire risks, agency spokesman Mike Ferris has said.

The service has spent some $967 million to protect lives and properties amid a season that has seen fires in Idaho, Utah, Colorado and California threaten homes and communities that border forest and wild lands where fire is more dangerous and costly to fight, Ferris said.



headline: Non-citizens could serve on California juries under bill passed Fri
byline: By Sharon Bernstein
1:08am EDT

Immigrants who are legally in the United States but not citizens would be allowed to serve on juries in California under a bill passed by the state legislature on Friday.

As written, the bill does not expressly require all lawful permanent residents to serve on juries, but many lawmakers said they assumed it would become mandatory.

The bill would allow immigrants to be included in the pool of potential jurors if they were permanent legal residents of the United States and live in California. Since those called for jury duty are expected to serve, some lawmakers said that right could become an obligation.

Governor Jerry Brown has not yet said whether he will sign the measure, which supporters said would increase the pool of people available to serve on juries while also increasing the rights and responsibilities of immigrants.

The bill's sponsor, Democratic Assemblyman Bob Wieckowski, likened the rules disqualifying immigrants who are permanent residents from jury service to long-discarded laws that kept blacks and women from serving.

"What we look for in jurors are characteristics like integrity, honesty, impartiality and the willingness to listen to all the evidence before coming to a conclusion," said Wieckowski, who represents the San Francisco Bay Area suburb of Fremont. "Lawful permanent residents, who live in the same county and speak English, can serve effectively as jurors."

But Rocky Chavez, a Republican who represents part of San Diego County, said allowing non-citizens on juries could deprive defendants of their right to have their case decided by a jury of their peers.

"Not everywhere is innocent until proven guilty," Chavez said during debate on the bill. "In some countries, it's guilty until proven innocent."

Such cultural differences could affect how an immigrant viewed a case, he said. In addition, he said, immigrants who have chosen to live in the United States without taking on the mantle of citizenship might find jury service onerous.

"I have lived overseas," he said. "I wouldn't want to serve on a jury in Japan."

The bill passed on a largely party line vote with three Democrats joining Republicans in opposition.

largest city.

A visibly emotional Filner addressed the San Diego City Council after members emerged from a closed meeting where they voted 7-0 to accept a settlement that requires him to step down, effective August 30, in exchange for the city joining in his legal defense in the lawsuit.

Filner, a 70-year-old Democratic former congressman elected San Diego mayor last year, had faced mounting pressure to step down after acknowledging behavior toward women that he said was unsuitable.

While Filner pledged to resign, his speech to a room full of reporters, accompanied by occasional cheers from supporters, was also defiant at times as he described being forced out of office.

"Certainly it was never my intention to be a mayor who went out like this," Filner said, before making an apparent reference to his 1960s work with civil rights group the Freedom Riders.

"You know I started my political career facing lynch mobs, and I think we have just faced one here in San Diego," he said. "In a lynch mob mentality, rumors become allegations, allegations become facts, facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall."

Filner's former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, sued him in July, accusing him of sexually harassing her. Since then 17 more women have come forward to say he groped them or made other unwanted advances.

Jackson's lawsuit is at the center of the settlement between Filner and the city, which sued him last month seeking to hold him responsible for any damages arising from the lawsuit.

As part of the deal, the city will join in his legal defense, according to an outline of the arrangement from the City Attorney's office which will be responsible for representing the mayor.

The city could also underwrite up to $98,000 in attorney fees for Filner's private legal defense, the document said, and while the city would pay for some forms of damages that may arise, it would not cover punitive damages.

'NO INTENTION TO BE OFFENSIVE'

During his speech, Filner, the first Democrat elected mayor of San Diego in two decades, also acknowledged that he had offended women.

"I had no intention to be offensive, to violate your personal or emotional space," he said.

High-profile attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Jackson, welcomed Filner's pending resignation.

In a statement, Allred noted that Filner in his speech had taken credit for protecting seals on San Diego beaches. "Unfortunately, he failed to give as much protection to the women who came into contact with him as he gave to the seals," she said.

Jackson, in her own written statement, said Filner "will not be missed."

Jessica Levinson, an associate clinical professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said Filner's only bargaining chip in discussions with the city had been his threat to remain in office.

"It sounds like it's an actual compromise, both sides get something," she said. "Ultimately what San Diego needs is for Filner to step down and for them to have a functioning mayor who's allowed in City Hall, and that the city doesn't fear that if he's allowed around women something bad is going to happen."

Under the city charter, City Council President Todd Gloria will assume the role of mayor until a special election is held within 90 days of the effective date of Filner's resignation.

If no single candidate in the special election wins a simple majority, then a runoff election would be held between the top two vote-getters within 49 more days.

The scandal will not hurt the chances of future Democratic candidates, said Steven Erie, a political science professor at the University of California at San Diego.

"I don't think it's damaged the Democratic brand for the simple reason that almost every major Democratic politician demanded Filner resign within about a week or so" of the scandal erupting, Erie said.

While Filner, 70, pledged to resign, his speech to a room full of reporters, accompanied by occasional cheers from supporters, was also defiant at times as he described being forced out of office.

headline: U.S. soldier who killed Afghan villagers gets life without parole
byline: By Eric M. Johnson
1:08am EDT

A decorated American soldier was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on Friday for killing 16 unarmed Afghan civilians, mostly women and children, in two bloody nighttime forays from his military post.

Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, a veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, has admitted to slaughtering the villagers in attacks on their family compounds in Kandahar province in March 2012.

He pleaded guilty to the killings in June in a deal that spared him the death penalty, and a sentencing jury of six military personnel deliberated less than two hours on Friday before deciding he should spend the rest of his life in prison.

Bales, who appeared in a military court in Washington state in blue military dress, showed no emotion as the verdict was handed down, but his mother cried and rocked back and forth.

Army prosecutors said Bales acted alone and with premeditation when, armed with a pistol, a rifle and a grenade launcher, he left his outpost twice during the night, returning in the middle of his rampage to tell a fellow soldier, "I just shot up some people."

The killings marked the worst case of civilian deaths blamed on a rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in Afghanistan.

"He wiped out generations and he ruined lives forever," prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Jay Morse told the jury in his closing arguments. "He should be known by one official title from this day until the day he dies: inmate."

In arguing for life without parole, Morse told jurors that Bales lacked a moral compass, and played video in which Bales could be seen returning to base on the day of the killings, cloaked in a blanket snatched during the rampage.

"This is the walk of a cold blooded killer," Morse said.

Defense attorneys had contended that Bales carried out the killings after suffering a breakdown under the pressure of the last of his four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. They said he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before shipping off to Kandahar province.

"We won the case when we got the death penalty off the table," John Henry Browne, one of Bales' attorneys, said in a statement after the sentence was handed down, adding the defense would mount an automatic appeal.

'WE DIDN'T GET OUR WISH'

Some Afghan survivors of the attack and family members of the victims who had been flown to the United States to testify about the impact of the shooting later expressed disappointment at a news conference that the penalty was not stronger.

"This murderer jumped into my house in the middle of the night, killed 11 members of my family and then burned them," said villager Hajji Mohammad Wazir, who lost his wife and six of his seven children, among other relatives, in the attacks.

"We were brought all the way here from Afghanistan to see if justice would be served. But not our way. The justice was served (in the) American way, their way," he said. "We wanted this murderer to be executed but we didn't get our wish."

Bales' sentencing came the same day a separate military jury convicted U.S. Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan of killing 13 people in 2009 when he walked into a medical facility at Fort Hood, Texas, and opened fire on unarmed soldiers with a laser-sighted handgun. He could face the death penalty.

Prior to the sentencing, Bales told the jury on Thursday he had struggled with anger issues that worsened after his third military deployment, but that he had tried to disguise his problems behind a veneer of normalcy. He said he briefly sought treatment before his final deployment but stopped after he felt it was not working.

He also apologized, both to his fellow servicemen and to the Afghan villagers, for the killings, saying: "What I did is an act of cowardice behind a mask of fear, bullshit and bravado."

In seeking the possibility of parole for Bales, civilian defense attorney Emma Scanlan had tried to persuade the jury to look at Bales' life in entirety while deciding on an appropriate sentence.

"We don't throw out the first 38 years," Scanlan said. "That doesn't mean, again, that there is anything about this that is not completely horrific."

Scanlan read a letter Bales wrote to his children and family before the attack in which he compared Afghan children to his own, saying they love "to eat candy and play soccer."

"Those aren't the words of a cold-blooded murderer who likes to kill innocent women and children," Scanlan said.

government movement, authorities said on Friday.

Undercover officers met with David Brutsche, 42, and his roommate Devon Newman, 67, more than 30 times, during which the suspects said they wanted to capture a police officer during a routine traffic stop, according to a police report.

Brutsche and Newman then planned to hold the officer in a makeshift jail and conduct a trial in what they considered a "sovereign court of law," the report said.

The suspects, arrested on Tuesday, intended to kill the officer after the trial, douse the body with bleach and vinegar and dispose of it in the Nevada desert, police said.

Police initiated the investigation of Brutsche in April when officers who came in contact with the man heard him "espouse the beliefs and ideology of the sovereign citizen movement," Lieutenant Jim Seebock of the Las Vegas Police Department's Counter-Terrorism Section told reporters.

Brutsche said "he was not subject to the laws of Clark County" where he lived "nor the United States," Seebock said.

Adherents of the "sovereign citizen" movement believe individuals are sovereign nations, and federal, state and local laws do not apply to them.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, said the number of hard-core believers in sovereign citizen principles may be 100,000 based on the number of tax protesters in the country.

Las Vegas police said Brutsche and Newman discussed their plans with undercover officers posing as sovereign citizen supporters, and the two had already set up a makeshift prison in the master bedroom of a private residence two days before they were arrested.

"The suspects further believed that once the first kidnapping and execution was accomplished, they would be compelled to keep repeating their actions, kidnapping and killing multiple officers," Seebock told reporters.

The two are charged with conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and attempted kidnapping with a deadly weapon, said Tess Driver, spokeswoman for the Clark County District Attorney's Office.

They have not entered a plea to the charges, but a preliminary hearing at a Las Vegas court is scheduled for September 9, Driver said. Prosecutors said they had not yet calculated the maximum sentence the suspects could face if convicted.

Brutsche's lawyer in the Public Defender's Office and Newman's attorney Carl Arnold could not be reached for comment.

In a jailhouse interview with local station KTNV, Newman denied the charges.

She said she wanted people to "to realize that our freedoms are being eroded. I want them to stand up for themselves and demand that the government apply the Constitution."

Newman and Brutsche are being held without bail at Clark County jail, Driver said.

old World War Two veteran who survived the Battle of Okinawa, police in Spokane, Washington, said on Friday.

Demetrius Glenn was taken into custody on suspicion of first-degree robbery and first-degree murder in the slaying of Delbert Belton after turning himself in on Thursday night, Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub said in a written statement.

Straub said police have "probable cause" to arrest the second suspect, Kenan Adams-Kinard, 16, who remains at large.

"We would encourage Mr. Adams-Kinard to surrender immediately," Straub said.

Belton was a U.S. Army veteran who was wounded in the Battle of Okinawa as Allied forces began their invasion of Japan's home islands in 1945.

The longtime Spokane resident was meeting a friend at the Fraternal Order of Eagles Lodge on Spokane's north side Wednesday night, Spokane Police Sergeant Lydia Taylor said.

The friend discovered Belton inside his car with "traumatic" injuries to his face and head, she said.

Taylor said Belton was transported to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries early on Thursday morning.

Still photographs from the lodge's security cameras that captured two young males running from the scene were released to the public, which led police to identify the two teens as suspects.

Several former players for the famous "Birmingham Black Barons" turned out for the occasion anxious to honor their old teams and teammates.

The interactive museum will feature holograms that allow visitors to stand in the line of fire as Paige pitches one of his legendary fastballs.

Visitors will also be able to meet former players volunteering at the museum who will be free to "tell all the lies they want," joked Layton Revel, founder of the Center for Negro League Baseball Research (CNLBR) in Dallas.

"It will be a museum like no other one in the country," said Revel, who will be donating most of the memorabilia that will fill the 5,000 square foot museum, including 1,500 baseballs.

His massive collection was once displayed in a now-closed museum in Dallas and could cover 30,000 square feet, he said.

Negro League teams were professional baseball teams made up of African-American players excluded from the all-white major leagues during segregation.

They began informally in the late 1800s and operated professionally from 1920 to 1960, drawing large crowds around the country. Some of Major League Baseball's most talented players emerged from these leagues, including Jackie Robinson, the first black player in the modern era to be signed by a major league team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, in 1945.

The new museum plans to work in unison with the Kansas City, Missouri-based Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, which was founded in 1990, Birmingham Mayor William Bell announced at a press conference.

"We look forward to cooperating in spreading the word of the history of the Negro leagues and its relevancy," concurred Bob Kendrick, president of the Missouri museum. "Birmingham has a rich black baseball history and great players whose careers began there."

The Birmingham museum will focus on the segregated Southern League and the Industrial League as well as the integration of baseball, to complement Birmingham's civil rights past.

"I played for the Raleigh Tigers for one year, before the St. Louis Cardinals signed me in 1963. I was one of the first black players after integration, and I was only 17 years old," said Ernest "Big Dog" Fann, now 70 years old, who's story will be featured in the new facility.

The Birmingham City Council in May approved $400,000 in funds for the $2 million construction project adjoining Birmingham's new downtown baseball field.

The rest of the funding will be raised privately, according to Chuck Faush, Jr. a spokesman for the mayor.

Construction is slated to start in October for a December 2014 opening.



headline: U.S. soldier who killed Afghan villagers gets life without parole

12:12am EDT

A decorated American soldier was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on Friday for killing 16 unarmed Afghan civilians, mostly women and children, in two bloody nighttime forays from his military post.

Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, a veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, has admitted to slaughtering the villagers in attacks on their family compounds in Kandahar province in March 2012.

He pleaded guilty to the killings in June in a deal that spared him the death penalty, and a sentencing jury of six military personnel deliberated less than two hours on Friday before deciding he should spend the rest of his life in prison.

Bales, who appeared in a military court in Washington state in blue military dress, showed no emotion as the verdict was handed down, but his mother cried and rocked back and forth.

Army prosecutors said Bales acted alone and with premeditation when, armed with a pistol, a rifle and a grenade launcher, he left his outpost twice during the night, returning in the middle of his rampage to tell a fellow soldier, "I just shot up some people."

The killings marked the worst case of civilian deaths blamed on a rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in Afghanistan.

"He wiped out generations and he ruined lives forever," prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Jay Morse told the jury in his closing arguments. "He should be known by one official title from this day until the day he dies: inmate."

In arguing for life without parole, Morse told jurors that Bales lacked a moral compass, and played video in which Bales could be seen returning to base on the day of the killings, cloaked in a blanket snatched during the rampage.

"This is the walk of a cold blooded killer," Morse said.

Defense attorneys had contended that Bales carried out the killings after suffering a breakdown under the pressure of the last of his four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. They said he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before shipping off to Kandahar province.

"We won the case when we got the death penalty off the table," John Henry Browne, one of Bales' attorneys, said in a statement after the sentence was handed down, adding the defense would mount an automatic appeal.

'WE DIDN'T GET OUR WISH'

Some Afghan survivors of the attack and family members of the victims who had been flown to the United States to testify about the impact of the shooting later expressed disappointment at a news conference that the penalty was not stronger.

"This murderer jumped into my house in the middle of the night, killed 11 members of my family and then burned them," said villager Hajji Mohammad Wazir, who lost his wife and six of his seven children, among other relatives, in the attacks.

"We were brought all the way here from Afghanistan to see if justice would be served. But not our way. The justice was served (in the) American way, their way," he said. "We wanted this murderer to be executed but we didn't get our wish."

Bales' sentencing came the same day a separate military jury convicted U.S. Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan of killing 13 people in 2009 when he walked into a medical facility at Fort Hood, Texas, and opened fire on unarmed soldiers with a laser-sighted handgun. He could face the death penalty.

Prior to the sentencing, Bales told the jury on Thursday he had struggled with anger issues that worsened after his third military deployment, but that he had tried to disguise his problems behind a veneer of normalcy. He said he briefly sought treatment before his final deployment but stopped after he felt it was not working.

He also apologized, both to his fellow servicemen and to the Afghan villagers, for the killings, saying: "What I did is an act of cowardice behind a mask of fear, bullshit and bravado."

In seeking the possibility of parole for Bales, civilian defense attorney Emma Scanlan had tried to persuade the jury to look at Bales' life in entirety while deciding on an appropriate sentence.

"We don't throw out the first 38 years," Scanlan said. "That doesn't mean, again, that there is anything about this that is not completely horrific."

Scanlan read a letter Bales wrote to his children and family before the attack in which he compared Afghan children to his own, saying they love "to eat candy and play soccer."

"Those aren't the words of a cold-blooded murderer who likes to kill innocent women and children," Scanlan said.

headline: Guantanamo war crimes tribunal in 'hot mess' over computer problems
byline: By Jane Sutton
4:46am EDT

Defense lawyers asked the judge in the Guantanamo war crimes tribunal on Friday to halt pretrial hearings in the 9/11 case until technicians fix a slew of computer and email problems that they said had made it nearly impossible to do their work.

"We're basically put back in the 19th century," said Army Major Jason Wright, who represents the alleged mastermind of the hijack plane attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed. "It takes about five to 10 times what it would normally take to do defense functions."

Pentagon technical advisers have said it would take up to 111 days to fix the problems once a contract was signed and money allocated, and that it was unlikely the work could be finished before the start of 2014.

The judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, said he would consider the matter further at a pretrial hearing scheduled to start on September 16 and decide then whether to cancel hearings set for October, November, December and January.

"I understand the serious nature of being able to communicate as a defense counsel," the judge said.

Defense lawyers said emails they sent were not received, investigative files that took years to compile had vanished and outside monitors were able to access their internet searches. Prosecutors and defense lawyers had temporarily been given access to each other's files, they said.

Some of the problems were disclosed earlier in the year. By April they had grown so severe that the chief defense counsel, Air Force Colonel Karen Mayberry, ordered defense lawyers to stop using their Pentagon computers for any confidential casework.

That means that to share draft documents with legal team members in other cities, they load them onto external drives, go to Starbucks and file them via Wi-Fi using their personal computers and personal email accounts, Wright said.

He said the chief of staff for the Pentagon official overseeing the tribunals issued her diagnosis in a conference call on Thursday, declaring: "This is a hot mess."

Clay Trivett, one of the prosecutors, questioned the severity of the problems, noting that the defense lawyers had produced PowerPoint presentations and extensive briefs for 29 legal motions argued at a week-long hearing that ended on Friday.

The problems stem from two main sources, the lawyers said.

Some began when technicians tried to create a mirrored system so work they did in Washington and work they did at the remote Guantanamo naval base were synchronized in both systems. Other issues began with a switch in email servers.

Defense attorney James Harrington, who represents Yemeni prisoner Ramzi bin al Shibh, said he had essentially been reduced to drafting motions with pen and paper.

Another of Mohammed's lawyers, David Nevin, called the problems especially worrisome in a death penalty case that prosecutors have routinely described as the most complex in U.S. history.

"In this day and age you cannot practice law this way," Nevin said.

The five defendants are accused of training and funding the hijackers who rammed four commercial jets into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania in 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people. They face charges that include conspiring with al Qaeda, terrorism and murder.

All five skipped court on Friday, the Muslim holy day.

Nine people whose relatives died in the attacks traveled to the base to watch the hearings. They said they had already waited 12 years for a verdict but would be patient if the computer problems caused more delays.

"We want something that stands on appeal," said Stephan Gerhardt, a Canadian citizen whose brother, Ralph, was a Cantor Fitzgerald vice president killed in the World Trade Center. "If it's going to take longer than we'd like it to take, that's fine. We're going to be here 'til the end."



headline: Florida imam gets 25 years in prison for aiding Pakistani Taliban
byline: By Zachary Fagenson
1:08am EDT

old south Florida imam was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a judge on Friday for funneling more than $50,000 to the Pakistani Taliban.

Hafiz Kahn was convicted in March on four counts of providing money and support to the group, which the United States considers a terrorist organization. He had faced a maximum of 60 years in prison, and prosecutors sought a 15-year sentence.

"The seriousness of what he did and the potential harm it could have caused is something this court takes seriously," U.S. District Judge Robert Scola said.

A U.S. citizen born in Pakistan, Khan was the imam at the Flagler Mosque, one of Miami's oldest mosques. He was arrested in 2011 along with two of his sons.

Prosecutors said Khan sent money to family and friends in Pakistan between 2008 and 2010 that was funneled to the Taliban, which they say used some of the funds to buy weapons.

"Mr. Khan took a list of his contacts and his desire to have sharia law in Pakistan and brought his mosque into this effort," said prosecutor John Carlton Shipley Jr. "He brought his family into this effort."

Evidence against the elder Khan included bank records and wiretapped phone calls in which he solicited money and expressed support for Pakistani Taliban efforts to overthrow the Pakistani government and attack Americans.

Khan said the money was intended to help support relatives, war victims and a school he had founded in his hometown in the Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan.

"Whatever money I sent was for the Islamic faith and to help poor people," Khan said through a translator. "I was never sympathetic to terrorists."

Prosecutors dropped charges against one of Khan's sons last year, citing a lack of evidence. A judge acquitted the other son for the same reason after prosecutors finished presenting their case in court in January.

Khan testified in court that he lied about supporting the Taliban because he wanted a $1 million donation from a purported Taliban sympathizer, a man who was actually an FBI informant.

The Pakistani Taliban was formed by Islamic militants in 2007. The U.S. State Department declared it a foreign terrorist organization three years later.

The group has been connected to a December 2009 suicide bomb attack on a U.S. military base in Khost, Afghanistan, that killed seven people. In 2011 the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for suicide bombings that killed more than 80 people in northwestern Pakistan.

headline: Fast-moving California wildfire rages into Yosemite National Park
byline: By Laila Kearney
1:08am EDT

A California wildfire swept further into Yosemite National Park on Friday, remaining largely unchecked as it threatened one of the country's major tourist destinations.

The so-called Rim Fire, which started on Saturday in the Stanislaus National Forest, had blackened 11,000 acres at the northeastern corner of Yosemite as of Friday afternoon after exploding in size overnight, park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said.

The blaze burning in the western Sierra Nevada mountains is now the fastest-moving of 50 large wildfires raging across the drought-parched U.S. West that have strained resources and prompted fire managers to open talks with Pentagon commanders and Canadian officials about possible reinforcements.

So far, the flames edging into scenic Yosemite have reached as far as Lake Eleanor, a remote area of the park which is normally accessible for fishing and hiking but was closed earlier this week along with several other areas after the fire broke out.

The park has been posting updates and alerts on its website on areas of access and closures. <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>)

The blaze, which has now charred a total of 165 square miles of forest land, mostly outside of Yosemite, was about 4 miles west of Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and some 20 miles from Yosemite Valley, the park's main tourist center, Cobb said.

"We're not anywhere near closing the (entire) park," she said. "We have to wait and see what the fire activity is and what it does, and we're just going to try as hard as we can to help with the suppression of the fire."

The Rim Fire, named for a Stanislaus National Forest lookout point called Rim of the World, has so far destroyed four homes and 12 outbuildings and was only 2 percent contained as of Friday.

"Firefighters are still going to have a stressful situation out there," fire information officer Ashley Taylor said of the fire burning in steep, rugged terrain. "We are just expecting a very active fire."

California Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Tuolumne County. A firefighter suffered heat-related illness while battling the flames on Thursday.

YOSEMITE ENTRANCE CLOSED

Highway 120, one of four access routes to a park known for its waterfalls, giant sequoia groves and other scenic wonders, was temporarily closed. The highway leads to the west side of the 750,000-acre park.

Located 195 miles from San Francisco and 315 miles from Los Angeles, Yosemite attracted nearly 4 million visitors last year.

The park was also threatening 4,500 homes near the burn zone, up from 2,500 on Thursday, and an undisclosed number of homes were ordered evacuated on Friday, adding to earlier evacuations.

In Idaho, meanwhile, crews increasingly had the upper hand over a massive blaze near the ski resort town of Sun Valley, as a storm system predicted to bring lightning and high winds brought rain instead.

The so-called Beaver Creek fire, now 67 percent contained, at its peak forced out occupants of 2,250 houses in upscale neighborhoods outside Sun Valley and destroyed one home and seven other buildings in a resort area in central Idaho where land and properties are valued at up to $8 billion.

The fire, sparked by lightning on August 7, has charred 111,000 acres of sagebrush, grasslands and pine forests in the Sawtooth Mountains at the height of a summer tourist season that draws thousands.

With the bulk of mandatory evacuation orders lifted, residents wearied by weeks of smoke and fire expressed new optimism. Linda and Ray Johnson, who were forced from their home near Ketchum last Friday and evacuated a second time in the pre-dawn hours on Saturday, returned to a home untouched by flames.

"I think the man upstairs was pulling a lot of strings," Linda Johnson said. "We're all just surviving with as much grace as we can and being as grateful as we can."

The 2013 fire season has already drained U.S. Forest Service fire suppression and emergency funds, causing the agency to redirect $600 million meant for other projects like campground and trail maintenance and thinning of trees to reduce wildfire risks, said agency spokesman Mike Ferris.

The service has spent some $967 million to protect lives and properties amid a season that has seen fires in Idaho, Utah, Colorado and California threaten homes and communities that border forest and wild lands where fire is more dangerous and costly to fight, Ferris said.

With hotshots and other elite fire crews stretched thin, U.S. fire managers will decide in coming days whether to seek U.S. military or international aid to check the roughly 50 large fires burning in the West.

depressants.

Outraged at police who cited Florida's "Stand Your Ground" self-defense law as a reason not to arrest neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, Agnew felt compelled to make a stand of his own.

The 28-year-old from Miami led the longest sit-in in memory at the Florida Capitol this summer. On Wednesday he will step up to the microphone in Washington to add his voice to those of President Barack Obama, former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and others commemorating the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech.

Now a salaried field organizer for the Service Employees International Union, Agnew represents a generation of civil rights activism half a century removed from King's iconic address.

Martin's killing prompted Agnew and many others to question whether equal justice in the United States was still only a dream.

The group he helped start, which calls itself the Dream Defenders, camped for 31 days in the office of Governor Rick Scott to protest Zimmerman's acquittal in July.

"We think the political landscape of America is turning very much in favor of young people now," Agnew told Reuters. "We want people to come together and talk about the future of Florida."

Many people blamed Zimmerman's acquittal on the Stand Your Ground law, under which people in fear of their lives no longer must try to retreat before defending themselves with potentially lethal force.

As the protest progressed, the Dream Defenders broadened their platform to include other issues, including educational opportunity and drug incarceration rates.

The Dream Defenders' protest surpassed by two weeks the 2011 pro-union sit-in at the Wisconsin Capitol, which was cut off by court order.

The group, which has established chapters on six of Florida's major public college campuses, is positioning itself to play a role in the 2014 midterm elections in a state that will be pivotal in the presidential campaigns that launch soon after.

"They planted the seeds for issues and mobilization efforts that clearly are going to be evident in the 2014 election cycle," said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida.

Agnew met fellow Dream Defenders founders Gabriel Pendas and Ahmad Abuznaid a decade ago, when he was a student at Florida A&M; University in the state capital, Tallahassee.

They got a taste of activism in 2006 while participating in marches and a two-day student-led sit-in at then-Governor Jeb Bush's office over the death of another black teen, Martin Lee Anderson, at a juvenile boot camp.

The Florida legislature subsequently closed all five state camps.

FROM SALES TO ACTIVISM

As a child of poverty, Agnew said he felt obligated upon graduation to use his business degree to secure a spot for himself in the middle class, and he took a sales job with pharmaceuticals company Eli Lilly &amp; Co.

But his experience in the Anderson case kept tugging at his conscience.

So within weeks of Martin's killing, Agnew said he gave up his $52,000 salary ($63,000 with bonuses), rented out his house and reconnected with Pendas, who was working as a union organizer in Miami, and Abuznaid who was vacationing in Amsterdam after passing the Florida bar.

Agnew draws a connection between the Dream Defenders and the anti-war and civil rights movements of two generations ago, especially after some of the 1960s leaders such as Jesse Jackson and Julian Bond joined them briefly in the Florida Capitol.

Bond agreed. "I think it's fair to say that, in many, many ways, what happened here over the last several days is very much like what happened across the South in the days when I was a young guy," he told Reuters as the Dream Defenders were decamping on August 15.

Despite ending the sit-in, Agnew said the Dream Defenders had accomplished some of their goals, including getting the speaker of Florida's House of Representatives to call for a committee hearing next month on the Stand Your Ground law.

He said it was fitting that the 50th anniversary of King's speech was only a few days away.

"There are many comparisons to be made between today and yesterday," he said. "This is the same struggle, the same fight, the same eagerness to do something about it. And we're lucky to have these spirited young people involved in it."

reaching law.

Restaurants want to increase the number of hours that define a full-time worker. Unionized electrical workers are seeking to change the treatment of health plans offered by multiple employers. Medical device companies hope to end a tax against them even though they are already paying that tax.

Lobbyists face slim odds of getting any additional changes to the law before October 1, when millions of Americans will be able to sign up for subsidized health insurance through online exchanges in each state.

But there is an urgency to push for changes now, legislative experts say, because it will become much harder to do so once the law takes full effect in January. Lobbying may also give these groups leverage in negotiations down the road.

"You can continue advocating for a change, and then you can trade those chips later on for something else," said Dan Mendelson, a former Clinton Administration health official who is chief executive of advisory company Avalere Health. "The fact that everybody knows they're unlikely to get anything will not stop advocacy."

A Reuters review of lobbying records found that more than 500 companies, business groups, consumer advocates, unions and other organizations weighed in on the Affordable Care Act during the second quarter of this year.

A typical issue in Washington attracts 15 interest groups at any one time, according to research by Beth Leech, a Rutgers University political science professor who has written three books about lobbying. At the height of political debate over the law, just before Congress passed the legislation in March 2010, more than 1,000 stakeholders lobbied on the bill.

"The Affordable Care Act, from beginning to end, has had an extraordinary amount of lobbying," said Leech. "All these rules are being made for the first time, so there's a great urgency to have that first rule be a rule you like."

The National Health Council, which represents patients diagnosed with chronic diseases, is fighting a government decision to delay until 2015 a limit on out-of-pocket costs for some consumers. According to the February ruling, Americans who end up being covered by two different companies for medical and pharmacy costs will have to meet maximum spending limits for both, potentially doubling their costs.

To push the issue, the health council drafted a letter signed by more than 100 patient groups objecting to the government's plan. Advocates then argued their case on a July conference call with representatives from three federal agencies - Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services. The government responded by saying the policy would stand.

"We understand that implementation of something this new, this big is going to be difficult," said Marc Boutin, NHC executive vice president, who wants to alleviate the out-of-pocket burden by January 1. "But we should not be creating additional barriers to access."

CHANGES IN THE SERVICE OF SMOOTHER ENROLLMENT

Others hope the Obama administration will show greater flexibility toward last-minute changes that would help the government sign up millions of uninsured Americans in the law's first year.

"We're in a homestretch just to get to October 1 at this point," said Krista Drobac, a policy adviser with law firm DLA Piper's healthcare policy and regulatory group. "The changes that you're going to see between now and then increase the chances of a smooth open-enrollment period."

She cited an agreement announced late last month between the U.S. government and eHealth Inc allowing the online insurance broker to enroll individuals eligible for tax subsidies in more than 30 states.

Some may have a tougher hill to climb. After more than three years of trying to solicit changes through the administration, the National Restaurant Association has turned to Congress to alter the law's definition of a full-time worker to one who works 40 hours a week, up from 30.

Starting in 2015, employers with more than 50 full-time staff are required to provide health coverage or face a penalty.

Waiters, kitchen staff and other restaurant employees work variable shifts that are difficult to track, while many restaurants are already monitoring the 40-hour threshold that triggers overtime payments, said Michelle Neblett, the NRA's director of labor and workforce policy. The 30-hour threshold would hurt the ability of employees to work flexible hours, she said, as managers will grow skittish about costs.

Groups may win success by finding ways to avoid the healthcare law's political quagmire altogether.

For instance, the medical device and health insurance industries may seek relief from new taxes imposed by Obamacare by lobbying on tax-reform proposals, arguing that the levies they face have been decoupled from Obamacare. "It's strictly an issue of corporate taxation," said J.C. Scott, chief lobbyist for the Advanced Medical Technology Association.

Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, said her center has written more than 100 pages of comments this year to influence new regulations. She recognizes that the administration has likely closed the door on tweaking rules.

"States really have to turn their attention to getting this up and running," Alker said.



headline: Possible closure of Ohio clinic shows new tactic in U.S. abortion clash
byline: By George Tanber

duty police patrol the parking lot.

A sign in a neighbor's window reads: "You Shall Not Murder."

Toledo's Capital Care abortion clinic, the only one in this rust belt city of 285,000, has become the latest front in the national battle over abortion rights, this one centering on a new state law that bars agreements to move women needing emergency care to public hospitals.

Toledo's clinic may have to close because its transfer agreement with a public hospital expired last month and under the new law it cannot renew it.

Abortion clinics in Ohio are required to have so-called transfer agreements with hospitals under which a patient can be admitted in case of complications. In 2011, the latest year for which data is available from the health department, complications arose in 91 of 24,764 abortions performed in Ohio.

The new law passed by Ohio's Republican-dominated legislature in June blocks public hospitals from entering into transfer agreements with abortion clinics. The result is that clinics either must have arrangements with private hospitals, since those with public hospitals are barred, or be forced to close since they would be operating without the required transfer agreement in place.

Eight other states require abortion clinics to have transfer agreements, including Nebraska and Wisconsin, and abortion rights groups fear Ohio's crack down could be replicated elsewhere.

"This is a brand new idea," said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. "It wouldn't be surprising if next year we saw this restriction appear in other states."

A renewed push by conservative Republicans to put fresh restrictions on abortion at the state level has resulted in a rash of new legislation over the past two years. New laws have ranged from limits on insurance coverage for abortions to requirements that women considering an abortion undergo an ultrasound test, during which technicians typically are required to point out a fetus' visible organs.

Some states have extended waiting periods for those who seek an abortion, while others have zeroed in on later term abortions.

Ohio's law marks yet another approach. Backers of the legislation say a transfer agreement with a public hospital amounts to indirect support for abortion, paid by many who disagree with it.

"We think it's going to protect taxpayers who oppose abortions," Ohio Right to Life President Michael Gonidakis said.

State Rep. Lynn Wachtmann, a Republican who chairs the House health committee, helped prepare the language for the transfer agreement law, which was included as a provision in the budget bill.

"The real issue with any agreement with a public hospital is the vast majority of the people in Ohio feel that no public funds or public entities should be supportive of the babykilling industry," said Wachtmann.

Opponents of the law say it will put women's health at risk, and decry it as a maneuver to undermine the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing the right to abortion. The court has left the states free to place various restrictions on abortion.

Nearly one in ten abortions performed in Ohio in 2011 was in Lucas County, which includes Toledo, according to the health department. A second abortion clinic in Toledo closed earlier this year.

Capital Care Network of Toledo's agreement with the University of Toledo Medical Center, a public hospital, to transfer patients in case of complications expired on July 31. It cannot renew that agreement under the new law.

Ohio's health director, Theodore Wymyslo, told Capital Care he is proposing revoking the facility's license, and that it has 30 days to request a hearing. His letter was received August 6, and the clinic had not yet requested a hearing as of Friday, according to the department.

"We are seeking a way to stay open," said Dr. Thomas Michaelis, who works at the clinic. "We have lawyers who are working on this out of our main office in Columbus."

Michaelis said if the clinic closes, women in the area will have to travel to Detroit, Cleveland or Columbus for abortions.

Terrie Hubbard, identified by the health department as the owner of Capital Care Network in Columbus, did not respond to requests for comment.

It was not clear if the new Ohio law would affect the state's 11 other abortion clinics, since the measure only directly affects those with transfer agreements with public hospitals rather than private.

Ohio Right to Life's Gonidakis said he does not know of any other abortion clinic tied to one of the state's 18 public hospitals. The health department said it was still reviewing the measure and its impact on the state's clinics.

Abortion rights groups, however, say the impact of the Ohio law could be felt beyond the Capital Care clinic.

"It's just a very shrewd way to close abortion clinics," said Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio. "This isn't about patient safety - this is about putting barriers between women and a safe, legal medical procedure."

A woman waiting at a bus-stop with her infant son near the Capital Care clinic said she had considered making an appointment there when she found out she was pregnant again two months ago. But then she heard the clinic was closing.

"I'm not happy," said the 21-year-old woman, who gave her name only as "Faye." "They made the decision for me."

The five defendants are accused of training and funding the hijackers who rammed four commercial jets into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania in 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people. They face charges that include conspiring with al Qaeda, terrorism and murder.

All five skipped court on Friday.

criminals.

And soon it expects at have at least three more.

Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan, who was found guilty on Friday of killing 13, mostly soldiers, in a rampage at a military base in Fort Hood Texas, could become the sixth man on death row at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Army staff sergeant Robert Bales, who was sentenced Friday to life in prison without parole for killing 16 Afghan civilians in a nighttime massacre last year, is also to serve out his sentence in Leavenworth, a semi-rural community in northeast Kansas.

U.S. soldier Bradley Manning, who was sentenced on Wednesday to 35 years in prison for turning over classified files to WikiLeaks, is also set to serve his sentence in Leavenworth.

It is the only maximum security - or "Level 3" - prison operated by the Department of Defense, handling military men who draw lengthy sentences for crimes deemed among the worst of the worst.

For decades the prisoners who were sent to Fort Leavenworth were locked away in an imposing fortress nicknamed the "Castle," which rose high from the bluffs along the Missouri River and had a reputation for grim surroundings and a strict adherence to discipline for the more than 1,000 prisoners it held.

The barracks of the original facility were torn down in 2004, but ghosts of executed prisoners continue to haunt some of the still-standing facilities, locals say.

The $68 million dollar, modern-day facility, known simply as the USDB, opened in 2002 and now houses about 450 prisoners. There are no bars, cells have solid doors and a window, and prisoners are spread through three triangular shaped housing units.

Five inmates at USDB are on death row, all convicted of premeditated murder or felony murder. There is no death chamber at the USDB and the last military execution dates back to 1961 and it is not clear when or if another will take place. Unlike state executions, members of the military cannot be executed unless the U.S. President personally confirms the death sentence.

If he receives the death penalty, the 42-year-old Hasan would live in an isolated corridor away from other inmates. Hasan was found guilty Friday of premeditated murder for killing 13 and attempting to murder 32 people in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas in November 2009. The convictions mean Hasan could face lethal injection. The penalty phase of Hasan's court-martial begins on Monday and the jury will make a recommendation to the judge, who will determine the sentence.

Prison officials will not speak about Manning or Hasan specifically - they refuse to discuss individual inmates. But spokeswoman Kimberly Lewis said no one gets special treatment at the USDB.

That means requests for special attire or hormone therapy, such as Manning's lawyer has said his 25-year-old client will seek to transition his gender from man to woman, will be hard to come by.

"According to Army regulations soldiers can not receive hormone therapy or reassignment surgery," said Lewis.

The prison does offer individual and group therapy, as well as vocational training. Inmates can learn woodworking, sheet metal and welding skills, barbering and study how to be a dental assistant. Inmates also have the use of an indoor gym and weight room, a music room, library and an arts and crafts studio as well an outdoor baseball field, running track and basketball court.

Currently on death row at Fort Leavenworth are Army private Ronald Gray, who was convicted of multiple murders and rapes in crime spree in 1986 and 1987; former Army sergeant Hasan Akbar, convicted of murdering two people and attempting to murder 16 soldiers in an attack on a camp in Kuwait; Dwight Loving, an Army private who robbed and killed two cab drivers, shooting them each in the head; Andrew Witt, of the U.S. Air Force, who was convicted of stabbing a husband and wife to death in their home; and Timothy Hennis, also of the Army, who was convicted of killing a North Carolina mother and her two children.

sighted handgun.

It was the deadliest mass murder ever at a U.S. military base.

The convictions mean Hasan could face the death penalty by lethal injection, possibly making him the first soldier to be executed by the U.S. military since 1961.

Hasan, dressed in combat fatigues and seated in a wheelchair after being paralyzed from the waist down when shot by police to end the rampage, stared directly at the jury while the panel's president read the verdict. Afterward he looked down, stroking his beard.

The jury of 13 combat veterans - nine colonels, three lieutenant colonels, and one major - deliberated about three hours on Thursday afternoon and another three hours on Friday morning. They will determine Hasan's sentence after hearing the penalty phase of the court-martial starting on Monday.

Hasan, 42, told mental health evaluators he wanted to become a martyr and lawyers assisting him said he was actively seeking the death penalty. Hasan disputed that claim without outright denying it, then sat passively as prosecutors presented overwhelming evidence against him.

Hasan, an American-born Muslim who acted as his own defense lawyer, admitted in his opening statement to killing 13 people and wounding 31, saying he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war on Islam. He was also charged with attempted premeditated murder on a 32nd person he shot at and missed.

Twelve of the dead were active duty soldiers and one was retired. Of the wounded, 30 were soldiers and one a police officer.

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges, and the conviction renewed calls by advocates who are seeking combat benefits for the victims similar to those paid to victims of the attacks of September 11, 2001.

Two attorneys representing some of the victims criticized the Department of Defense for classifying the attack as "workplace violence," and Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson vowed to fight for state veterans' benefits such as access to below-market interest rates for loans to buy land.

"MY BABY, MY BABY"

In their closing statement, prosecutors stressed that Hasan's rampage on November 5, 2009, was premeditated, noting that he wore a uniform even though he was on leave and stuffed his pockets with paper towels to prevent some 20 magazines of ammunition from jingling.

Prosecutors called 89 witnesses in two weeks of testimony, with many describing in horrific detail the bloodbath in and around a medical building at Fort Hood.

Private Francheska Velez, who was pregnant, screamed "my baby, my baby" before being shot dead. Others were gunned down while trying stop Hasan, and survivors reported seeing the red laser of his weapon flashing across their eyes. Investigators recovered 146 shell casings from the scene.

Amid speculation about the emotional toll on victims who may have had to face cross-examination from him, Hasan spared them from questioning.

For Hasan to be eligible for the death penalty, the jury needed to find he killed at least two people, and at least one of those had to be a unanimous premeditated murder conviction.

The jury must also be unanimous in order to impose the death penalty, which would trigger a lengthy process requiring the approval of the Fort Hood commanding general, and later the president of the United States, in order for there to be an execution.

The shootings came at a time of heightened tensions over the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which strained relations between the United States and countries with predominantly Muslim populations.

Hasan opened fire at an area where soldiers were being evaluated before being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan or after returning home, yelling "Allahu akbar" ("God is greatest" in Arabic), according to several witnesses.

Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing, praised Hasan as a hero and "a man of conscience." U.S. intelligence officials say Hasan had sent emails to Awlaki, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011. The judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, blocked those emails from being submitted as evidence in the trial.

Hasan told the judge at one point during the trial his attack was motivated by "an illegal war" and that he had "adequate provocation" to launch the attack on soldiers readying to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Hasan's trial took place at the same time as two other high-profile courts-martial. Also on Friday, Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales was sentenced to life in prison for killing 16 Afghan civilians in 2012. On Wednesday, U.S. Army Private First Class Bradley Manning was sentenced to 35 years for providing secret files to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.

striking inmates protesting against the practice, a U.N. expert said on Friday.

Californian prisoners launched a hunger strike on July 8 to demand an end to the housing of inmates in near-isolation for years on end because they are believed to be associated with gangs.

Juan E. Méndez, the independent United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, said the U.S. government should abolish the use of prolonged solitary confinement under all circumstances.

"Even if solitary confinement is applied for short periods of time, it often causes mental and physical suffering or humiliation, amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and if the resulting pain or sufferings are severe, solitary confinement even amounts to torture," Méndez said in a statement.

Solitary confinement should only be used "in very exceptional circumstances, as a last resort, for as short a time as possible and with established safeguards in place" and under strict medical supervision.

About 80,000 U.S. prisoners are in solitary confinement, including nearly 12,000 in California, said the statement issued by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Méndez was particularly concerned about California's Pelican Bay maximum security prison, which has more than 400 prisoners who have been in isolation for over a decade, with an average time in solitary of 7.5 years.

California's jails won federal court permission this week to force-feed hunger-striking inmates, even if they have signed orders asking not to be resuscitated. A prison health spokeswoman said on Tuesday there was no imminent need to do so.

As of Monday, 136 inmates were taking part in the strike.

Méndez said it was "not acceptable to use threats of forced feeding or other types of physical or psychological coercion against individuals who have opted for the extreme recourse of a hunger strike".

In many cases the inmates are isolated for 22-23 hours per day in cells measuring 8 by 12 feet, with poor ventilation and no natural light, the statement said.

The comments by Méndez, a professor at the American University - Washington College of Law, are not binding on the United States, but his opinions could form the basis for debate at the United Nations.

The U.S. record is due to be scrutinized in October by the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance with a landmark treaty on civil and political rights.

Méndez is himself a former torture victim from Argentina.

hours culture of the world's top banks.

Moritz Erhardt, a 21-year-old German student, was found dead late last week at his London accommodation after allegedly working for 72 hours without sleep during a summer internship with the U.S. bank's investment banking division.

The cause of his death remains unknown, and the bank has declined to comment on reports that he was epileptic. The results of blood tests are not due back for several weeks.

But Erhardt's death raised questions over who was responsible for the long hours worked by ambitious graduates who push themselves to the limit during summer internships to secure jobs in the highly competitive and well-paid finance industry.

A spokesman for Bank of America said it had convened a senior working group to "look at all aspects our working practices, with a particular focus on our junior populations".

He declined to comment on who would be involved in the group, how long the review would take, or possible outcomes.

"Our immediate priority is to do everything we can to continue to support the Erhardt family, our interns and impacted employees at this extremely difficult time," he said in a statement.

Former interns and junior employees say 20-hour days, weekends at work and meals in the office are par for the course in the glass towers of finance in London and New York.

Many talk of the "magic roundabout" where workers get a taxi home after dawn and leave it waiting while they have a quick shower and then return to work.

"SLAVERY IN THE CITY"

But Erhardt's death has spurred a debate about the grueling schedules that interns endure, with one British newspaper dubbing the lifestyle "slavery in the city".

Many interns, however, said they imposed these long hours on themselves as they were determined to use the summer to prove that they had what it takes to succeed.

Gordon Chesterman, director of the careers service at the University of Cambridge, one of the UK's top universities, said it was the responsibility of employers to change the system.

"My hope is that this has been a wake-up call and that employers will take a long, hard look at what they are doing with their interns ... How much longer can we carry on with this regime of long hours?" Chesterman said.

Employment lawyers said companies had legal obligations to ensure employees, including interns, were not exposed to health and safety risks and warned that failing to meet those obligations could leave them open to criminal prosecution and hefty fines.

"Allowing or turning a blind eye to an intern going beyond the call of duty to show they can best handle the pressure may breach those duties and statutory obligations if an intern is injured as a result," said Michael-John Andrews, expert employment lawyer from Barlow Robbins LLP.

A spokeswoman for Britain's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills declined to comment on working conditions for interns but said under European Union rules workers aged 18 and over could decide to work more than a standard 48-hour week.

Interns, however, were skeptical that banks could end the workaholic culture that consumes newcomers every summer.

"You'd have to have someone checking security passes to see how long they've been in the office, but even when they are at home they are glued to their Blackberry and feel like they're on call," said a former intern at Nomura.



headline: Philadelphia teachers protest pay cut demands
byline: By Hilary Russ
1:08am EDT

Hundreds of teachers in Philadelphia voiced their outrage on Thursday at proposed pay and benefit cuts as public school officials demanded $133 million in concessions from employees because of a financial crisis.

With the teachers' labor contract due to expire on August 31 and school set to start about a week after that, the district and union leaders are still far apart on terms, according to George Jackson, spokesman for the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers.

Teachers are being asked to take salary cuts of between 5 and 13 percent next year and to pay more for health coverage.

More than 200 teachers held a march and then rallied outside the school board offices on Thursday to protest the demands.

Teacher Darcel McClen expressed disappointment that she has had to spend $1,000 of her own money on classroom supplies and taught 30 kindergartners without a classroom aide last year.

McClen, who took a pay cut to switch careers and become a teacher nine years ago, makes about $56,000 a year and is facing a 13 percent pay cut.

"It's like we're not appreciated," she said. "It's an awful feeling."

Scott Knoflicek, a middle school science teacher protesting with his two young daughters in tow, said he goes dumpster diving for the bottles, cans, furniture and other supplies he needs to teach his lab classes.

Because of the budget crisis driven by a weak economy and falling enrollment in traditional schools, the school district had to shutter 30 schools over the past two years. In June, it laid off about 3,800 teachers, assistant principals, aides and other staffers to close a $304 million shortfall. Pension benefits are set at by the state and are not an issue in the local negotiations.

The long-brewing financial crisis for Philadelphia's school system reached a crescendo earlier this month when Superintendent William Hite threatened to delay the start of the school year because the district had so few remaining employees.

A last-minute $50 million loan from the city is expected to allow Hite to rehire about 1,000 employees and allow the schools to reopen on-time on September 9.

STUDENTS FLEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Urban school systems across the United States have been hammered by reductions in state aid since the 2007-09 recession. In many states, the level of aid still hasn't returned to pre-recession levels.

The rapid growth of charter schools has compounded the problem, as students flee traditional public school systems and take a share of state funds with them.

Philadelphia has hemorrhaged students. In 2008, just 16 percent of pupils were enrolled in charter schools. But for the 2013-2014 school year, about 62,000 - or more than a third - of Philadelphia's 198,000 students will attend one of about 80 charter schools, according to Moody's Investors Service.

When school starts, Philadelphia will have about 134,000 students in 212 public schools, according to Fernando Gallard, spokesman for the district.

"We are at the (negotiating) table every day," he said. "We hope it's a positive result." He declined to provide further details on the status of talks.

Jackson, the teachers' union spokesman, would not say whether members were prepared to strike if no agreement is reached.

"We're planning to continue negotiations and work toward a contract that's good for the our schools, our students, our members and the school district," he said.

In Chicago, teachers walked off the job for eight days at the start of the school year in 2012. It was the city's first teachers' strike in a quarter of a century, spurred on by Mayor Rahm Emanuel's drive for sweeping education reforms as their contract was about to run out.

Pennsylvania has played a role in overseeing Philadelphia's school district since 2001, when the state established a school reform commission (SRC) for the district. Three of its five members are appointed by the governor and two others by the mayor, with no elected members.

The city has a population of about 1.5 million, down from a peak of more than 2 million in the 1950s. Its median family income of about $37,000 is well below the state and national average.

parched American West.

Preliminary plans for military and international aid come as the U.S. Forest Service is feeling the pinch of federal budget cuts known as sequestration even as demand for firefighters and equipment such as air tankers is exceeding supply, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise.

Elite teams of firefighters known as hotshots and smoke jumpers, whose job it is to mount the initial attack on blazes in remote, rugged terrain, are stretched too thin, said Stephen Gage, assistant operations director for fire and aviation management for the Forest Service.

The agency's 100-plus hotshot crews are all either assigned to fires in the West or are taking required periods of rest and recovery, leaving no spare teams to dispatch to any additional fires where they might be needed, he said.

"We have just a limited number of those assets. We'd love to give everybody what they need when they ask for it," he said. "Deciding which area gets those highly skilled crews and which doesn't is the hardest thing we do."

Fire managers are poised to decide in coming days whether to "pull the trigger" on a pending request to the U.S. military for an initial deployment of 200 ground troops to supplement firefighting personnel, Gage said. It would take roughly a week to train and mobilize those troops, who would then be assigned to large fires in the West.

Thousands of firefighters were laboring on Thursday to suppress dozens of blazes raging in several Western states, from a monster fire menacing the area around the world-class ski resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, to a California blaze near Yosemite National Park that more than tripled in size overnight.

Meanwhile, weather forecasters have predicted heightened wildfire risks for northern California, the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Rockies posed by storm systems likely to bring lightning and strong winds.

FIRE INDEX RAISED

U.S. fire managers this week opened the way to potentially seeking military aid and gaining firefighting resources stemming from agreements with Canada, Australia and New Zealand by raising the national wildfire alert index to the maximum level of 5 for the first time in five years.

Gage said he could not recall any previous instance in recent years when the United States has requested large-scale Canadian assistance, such as fire crews and aircraft, in addition to the several air tankers already on loan from Canada.

"We've opened discussions with Canada about utilizing their assets if they are available," he said.

Federal fire officials have already shifted stores of equipment such as hand tools and supplies from Southern states like Kentucky to the West amid all-out air and ground offensives against flames that have charred hundreds of thousands of acres (tens of thousands of hectares) of parched sagebrush, grasslands and forests.

The 2013 fire season has already seen the most destructive fire in Colorado history, the deadliest blaze on record in Arizona and has forced the evacuation of many thousands across the region.

Years of drought have played a key role in the ignition and spread of blazes that fire managers say stand out for their intensity and speed, even as the overall acreage burned remains below the 10-year average.

old Australian university student police say was murdered "for the fun of it" by three bored Oklahoma teenagers, has surpassed $113,000, according to the "gofundme" website.

The donations, which totaled $113,311 (AUD $125,524) as of Thursday afternoon, are to cover expenses for Lane's family to be able to fly to Oklahoma to receive his body and return him to Melbourne, the website said.

Lane, who was attending East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma, on a baseball scholarship, was killed by a gunshot in the back on Friday as he was jogging in Duncan, Oklahoma.

The organizer of the Christopher Lane Fund, Marshall Veal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On the website, he said that "through all the confusion and hard times we have been able to clear things up and Christopher Lane is being taken back to his family in Australia."

According to the Duncan Banner newspaper, Veal is a former teammate of Lane's.

Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards Jr., 15, have been charged with first degree murder, according to the Stephens County District Attorney's office. Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, has been charged with use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory to murder after the fact, the District Attorney's office said.

According to police, Jones said the three teens decided to kill someone "for the fun of it."

Police said Jones told them on Sunday that the three teenagers saw Lane out jogging and decided he would be their target, followed him in their vehicle and then shot him. Jones was driving the car, and Luna fired the gun, according to prosecutors.



headline: Planned Parenthood sues Indiana over abortion clinic requirements
byline: By Susan Guyett
1:08am EDT

called abortion pill to have full surgical facilities, which it says would halt abortion services at a clinic in the state.

Under the law, Planned Parenthood would have to upgrade its clinic in Lafayette, Indiana, to surgical standards or stop administering RU-486, commonly called the abortion pill, it said in a lawsuit filed in Indianapolis federal court.

Separately, the group that has been at the forefront of the U.S. national battle over abortion won a legal fight to block an Arizona law that would have cut off funding through the state for its health care clinics because they also performs abortions.

Imposing surgical facility requirements on clinics where no surgery is performed "is not only unreasonable, it is utterly irrational ...," Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky said in the lawsuit, which seeks a federal court injunction.

Legislators supporting the law that took effect July 1 have said it would protect women's health. It requires clinics providing non-surgical abortions to have separate procedure, recovery and scrub rooms like surgical centers starting January 1.

Planned Parenthood operates four of the 10 clinics that provide abortions in Indiana. Three Planned Parenthood clinics perform surgical abortions and administer the abortion pill at up to nine weeks of pregnancy. The Lafayette clinic offers only the abortion pill at up to nine weeks of pregnancy.

The Lafayette clinic provided 54 non-surgical abortions in the 12 months ended July 1, and other medication, primarily contraception, more than 10,000 times, the lawsuit said.

If the Lafayette clinic stops providing non-surgical abortions, the closest clinics are 60 miles away in Indianapolis or 85 miles in Merrillville, Planned Parenthood said, adding that the Lafayette clinic would continue to provide health services.

Planned Parenthood applied on July 15 with Indiana state health officials for a license and a waiver of the requirements.

The Indiana law exempts physician's offices from the requirements as long as surgical procedures performed there are not primarily surgical abortions and abortion-inducing drugs are not the primarily prescribed drugs.

The requirements violate a woman's constitutional right to privacy, equal protection and are "arbitrary and irrational" in violation of a woman's right to due process, the lawsuit said.

The two-pill abortion medication called RU-486 has been legally available in the United States since 2000. By 2008 it accounted for about a quarter of U.S. abortions performed before nine weeks of gestation, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports the right to abortion.

In the Arizona case, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco affirmed that the law robs individuals on Medicaid of the ability to choose healthcare services. The law would have stopped Medicaid funding for all procedures to any healthcare provider who performed abortions.

The bill targeting Planned Parenthood was signed into law in May 2012 by Republican Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, with the strong backing of socially conservative lawmakers. It came as part of nationwide moves by abortion opponents to defund groups like Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers.

Medicaid, a joint program between states and the federal government, provides healthcare coverage for low-income individuals.



headline: Beaten Ohio inmate dies in prison's third killing in a year
byline: By Kim Palmer
1:08am EDT

An Ohio prisoner who was beaten with baseball bats by his fellow inmates has died, becoming the third man killed in just the past year at an overcrowded state prison in northeastern Ohio, officials said on Thursday.

James Oglesby, 32, who was serving a life sentence for aggravated murder and kidnapping, died Wednesday at a Toledo hospital, said Ricky Seyfang, spokeswoman for the state corrections department. He was beaten Sunday in the recreation yard at Toledo Correctional Institution, Seyfang said.

"Three homicides in one facility is high," said Joanna Saul, executive director of the Correctional Institution Inspection Committee, a state legislative group that monitors prisons.

Ohio's entire prison system had one confirmed homicide in 2010, two in 2011 and three in 2012, Saul said. With Oglesby's death, the Toledo prison has had three homicides since September 2012, she said.

Saul said her group had just inspected the prison, which she said has been plagued by high employee turnover and gang violence in part due to overcrowding. Ohio's prison system has been operating at about 130 percent of capacity, she said.

The Toledo prison was built in 2000 to house 950 prisoners in individual cells. Inmates have been doubled up and more than 200 maximum security inmates added since 2010, raising its population to nearly 1,300, according to Saul and Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction records.

Violent attacks between inmates have increased 113 percent, and inmate attacks on staff by 73 percent since the prison went to two inmates per cell, Saul said.

"Toledo has a high employee turnover rate and that means less experienced officers dealing with the challenges of a higher security population," Saul said.

Seyfang said Oglesby's killing is under investigation. He had been transferred to the prison in February, she said.

byline: By Lisa Maria Garza
1:08am EDT

A former paramedic who responded to a deadly explosion at a Texas fertilizer plant in April, only to be charged weeks later with unlawful possession of pipe bomb components, was released from a county jail on Thursday.

A federal judge ordered Bryce Reed, 31, to be released on a $25,000 bond into the custody of his mother.

Reed was indicted in May for possession of an unregistered destructive device. Earlier he had become one of the faces of the rescue effort in the aftermath of the massive explosion in the town of West.

The West Fertilizer Co facility exploded on April 17 about 20 minutes after a fire was reported at the plant. The blast killed 14 people and badly damaged a residential area, including an apartment building, nursing home and school.

The cause of the fire remains unknown. Investigators say they have not eliminated the possibility that it was set intentionally.

This month McLennan County District Attorney Abel Reyna said a state law enforcement report on Reed concluded there was no evidence linking him to the incident. Reed has denied any involvement.

known faces of the town following the blast. When the fire broke out at the plant, he assisted in the evacuation, he told Reuters. He later learned that a close friend was among the dead.

His trial is due to begin at federal court in Waco on September 23.

On Thursday, Jonathan Sibley, Reed's attorney, said his client was "thrilled" with the judge's decision.

"We are glad the court reviewed the evidence and decided that Mr. Reed should be released pending his trial," Sibley said in an email. "We look forward to our day in court and addressing the allegations against Mr. Reed."



headline: Bradley Manning faces legal and social difficulties as transgender
byline: By Ellen Wulfhorst
1:08am EDT

Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier sentenced this week for leaking 700,000 classified documents to WikiLeaks in the biggest breach of secret data in the country's history, could soon be entangled in another legal showdown.

Unlike the court-martial Manning faced for leaking the data, the next challenge could play out in federal court over a far different issue: sexual identity.

Manning's announcement on Thursday of wishing to live as a woman named Chelsea raised unprecedented legal questions over whether the Army will provide the female hormone therapy Manning wants to undergo, not to mention questions over how life will unfold as a transgender military inmate.

"The prime issue concerns the manner in which Chelsea Manning will be treated in prison, and whether she will have the same access that all prisoners have to treatments that are prescribed to her," said Michael Silverman, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund in New York.

"Will the prison in which she is housed allow her doctors to treat her the same way they allow them to treat other prisoners?" he asked.

Manning, 25, was sentenced to 35 years at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, which houses military prisoners about 25 miles north of Kansas City, Kansas.

At Fort Leavenworth, Manning will have access to mental health professionals, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, social workers and behavioral science specialists, according to an Army spokeswoman.

But she said the Army did not provide hormone therapy, which is what Manning would seek, or gender-reassignment surgery.

"I'm hoping that Fort Leavenworth will do the right thing and provide that," Manning's attorney, David Coombs, said on the "Today" show. "If Fort Leavenworth does not, then I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that they are forced to do so."

Neal Minahan, a Boston lawyer who won a federal court decision in 2011 for his client to receive hormone therapy in a Massachusetts state prison, said federal judges have consistently knocked down bans on such therapy.

"What is very clear is that prisons cannot do exactly what Leavenworth is doing in saying that there is a blanket ban on hormone therapy as a matter of policy," he said.

But while Manning's first step would be getting a doctor's prescription for the treatment, the soldier will likely face years getting legal approval in the courts, Minahan said.

Manning's lawyers argued during the sentencing phase of the court-martial that the soldier suffered from gender identity disorder. Coombs said on Thursday that Manning has had feelings of being female since childhood.

The American Psychiatric Association in its newest diagnostic manual replaced "gender identity disorder" with "gender dysphoria" to remove the stigma associated with the diagnosis and avoid what it said was the incorrect indication that gender nonconformity was a mental disorder.

Prescribed treatments for gender dysphoria can range from hormones, which typically affects breast development and other secondary sex characteristics, to facial feminization and genital surgery.

Challenging the Army's policy on hormone therapy could have long-term broader benefits, said Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project at Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders, or GLAD.

In the Massachusetts case, she said, the ruling not only knocked down the policy but also helped launch training for prison staff.

"It's that kind of training and education that I think ultimately changes the ways people view the transgender experience," Levi said. "As there's more understanding of the medical condition, there's more humanity that is extended to people who experience it."

Coombs said he was not worried about Manning's safety in a military prison since inmates there were first-time offenders who wanted to complete their sentences and get out.

Still, experts said transgender inmates tend to be vulnerable or targeted, and steps taken to protect them can be punitive, such as segregation or isolated cells. Fort Leavenworth is an all-male prison. Female military prisoners are housed at the Naval Consolidated Brig Miramar in California.

A spokeswoman for the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Manning case.

"The worst case scenario is that she's going to experience harassment or abuse in prison as a result of being transgender," said Silverman, of the Transgender Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund. "That abuse might or could include the withholding of medical treatment.

"It's hard for people who haven't been diagnosed with gender dysphoria to understand quite how severe it can be to have treatment withheld," he said. "It can have profoundly debilitating effects on people."



headline: Planned Parenthood sues Indiana over abortion clinic requirements

called abortion pill to have full surgical facilities, a requirement it says would halt abortion services at a central Indiana clinic.

Under the law, Planned Parenthood would have to upgrade its clinic in Lafayette, Indiana, to surgical standards or stop administering RU-486, commonly called the abortion pill, it said in a lawsuit filed in Indianapolis federal court.

Imposing surgical facility requirements on clinics where no surgery is performed "is not only unreasonable, it is utterly irrational ...," Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky said in the lawsuit, which seeks a federal court injunction.

Legislators supporting the law, which took effect July 1, have said it would protect women's health. It requires clinics providing non-surgical abortions to have separate procedure, recovery and scrub rooms like surgical centers starting January 1.

Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a statement on Thursday that, "We look forward to respectfully asserting the state's case" in defending the constitutionality of the law.

Planned Parenthood operates four of the 10 clinics that provide abortions in Indiana. Three Planned Parenthood clinics perform surgical abortions and administer the abortion pill at up to nine weeks of pregnancy. The Lafayette clinic offers only the abortion pill at up to nine weeks of pregnancy.

The Lafayette clinic provided 54 non-surgical abortions in the 12 months ended July 1, and other medication, primarily contraception, more than 10,000 times, the lawsuit said.

If the Lafayette clinic stops providing non-surgical abortions, the closest clinics are 60 miles away in Indianapolis or 85 miles away in Merrillville, Planned Parenthood said, adding that the Lafayette clinic would continue to provide health services.

Planned Parenthood applied on July 15 with Indiana state health officials for a license and a waiver of the requirements.

The Indiana law exempts physician's offices from the requirements as long as surgical procedures performed there are not primarily surgical abortions and abortion-inducing drugs are not the primarily prescribed drugs.

The requirements violate a woman's constitutional right to privacy, equal protection and are "arbitrary and irrational" in violation of a woman's right to due process, the lawsuit said.

The two-pill abortion medication called RU-486 has been legally available in the United States since 2000. By 2008 it accounted for about one-fourth of U.S. abortions performed before nine weeks of gestation, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports the right to abortion.

As approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the drugs are dispensed by prescription directly from a physician. They are not available in pharmacies.

headline: Outgoing FBI chief stands up for record on Wall Street fraud
byline: By David Ingram
1:08am EDT

FBI Director Robert Mueller sought on Wednesday to dispel any perception among Americans that the bureau and the Justice Department let bankers go free after they helped bring about the U.S. financial crisis.

The complexity of the crisis made it difficult to identify what crimes might have occurred and to explain to Americans why there was a scarcity of prosecutions on Wall Street, Mueller told reporters in response to questions about the crisis.

Mueller was speaking in a rare interview 12 years into the job and just weeks before his September 4 departure.

"I would say that's a misperception. There were a number of contributing factors to the crash in 2008, and if you look at the statistics in terms of persons we've investigated and prosecuted, there are a number that are out there, and investigations are ongoing," said the 69-year-old former prosecutor and U.S. Marine.

"Often it's very difficult to put it all together and paint a picture that is persuasive when you have such disparate contributing factors to a particular crisis," he added, "but where we've found the evidence and we've followed the evidence, I think we have a pretty good track record."

The FBI granted the Wednesday interview on condition it not be reported until late on Thursday, to accommodate other interviews.

Mueller did not mention specific recent cases but said comparisons to earlier sweeps of white-collar crime, such as the savings-and-loan crisis that began in the late 1980s, were unfair. Back then, he said, "The cases were relatively easy to identify and were clear frauds."

While he called insider-trading cases an "offshoot" from the financial crisis, he said U.S. investigators should get credit for bringing those, too.

Mueller became FBI director a week before the hijacked plane attacks of September 11, 2001, on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon, a calamity that forced the bureau to shift radically its priorities and capabilities.

He will leave behind a very different FBI. More than half the agents began work there after the September 11 strikes, and the bureau's first priority - unquestioned in Washington - is to prevent a similar attack.

"I did not expect I'd be spending my time in preventing terrorist attacks," Mueller said. He had spent his career prosecuting crimes - including local murders in Washington - after they occurred, not preventing them.

Mueller's 12-year stint makes him the second longest-serving director in FBI history after J. Edgar Hoover.

"In the last 12 years, I think the American public has expected us to, yes, clean up the white-collar criminal activity, yes, handle public corruption, but most particularly to not allow another September 11 attack," he told reporters, sitting in a conference room at the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington.

With 36,000 employees, the FBI is the largest U.S. investigative agency and the closest thing the country has to a national police force. Its investigations cover not only counterterrorism but organized crime, financial fraud, cybercrime and more.

QUESTIONS ABOUT BOSTON, FORT HOOD

Mueller would not address several of the subjects reporters raised. He repeatedly declined to comment on the U.S. pursuit of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, charged under espionage laws for leaking secrets to newspapers.

Despite praise from lawmakers for the lack of another major attack on U.S. soil on his watch, Mueller said part of the success was luck. He also said he still wonders if more could have been done to prevent April's Boston Marathon bombing and the shooting in Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.

The two attacks share a pattern of "individuals acting pretty much on their own, without ties to a formalized terrorist group, not orchestrated overseas," he said, and the model would probably be replicated by others.

A government-ordered review of the Fort Hood shooting said the FBI had no specific knowledge that Major Nidal Hasan was planning the attack, but that the bureau should have interviewed him because it was in possession of emails Hasan had sent to a militant Muslim cleric.

A jury is weighing whether to convict Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 and wounding more than 30. His trial began last month.

An official review of the Boston bombing, in which two bombs exploded, killing three people and wounding about 260, has not been released.

After nearly an entire adult career in government, Mueller said he planned to spend time giving speeches, teaching and conducting private investigations. He said he had yet to decide whether to join a firm or start his own.



headline: U.S. judge overturns Colorado city's sex offender residency law
byline: By Keith Coffman
1:08am EDT

A federal judge has struck down a Colorado city's ordinance that restricts where registered sex offenders can reside, ruling that it conflicts with a state law requiring parolees to be reintegrated into society.

U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson in Denver ruled that the city of Englewood, a Denver suburb, could not impose restrictions that "leave essentially no place for such offenders to live for all intents and purposes."

The city's ordinance barred convicted sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of schools, parks or playgrounds, or within 1,000 feet of day-care facilities, recreation centers and trails, swimming pools, bus stops and school routes.

Jackson noted in his 24-page opinion that cities may impose reasonable constraints on where sex offenders can live, but he said Englewood and five other Colorado cities with similar laws have gone too far.

"In theory, every city and county could enact a similar 'not in my backyard' ordinance and effectively ban sex offenders ... from the entire state," he said.

A number of local governments and states across the country have enacted laws banning sex offenders from living near parks and schools, including California, Texas, Kentucky, Florida and Georgia.

The ruling stemmed from the case of Brett Ryals, a former soccer coach who was sentenced to seven years on probation after pleading guilty to having an unlawful sexual relationship with an underage girl who was one of his players.

Ryals was sentenced to two years in prison after violating his probation by continuing to see his victim. He completed his sentence and other requirements and was ultimately paroled.

He then purchased a home in Englewood. But when he registered as required with police in the suburb of 30,000 people south of Denver, he was told that his residence was within a restricted area.

A lawsuit challenging the restrictions was brought on his behalf by the Colorado chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Mark Silverstein, the ACLU's legal director in Colorado, said cities that pass such laws provide "a false sense of security" to their residents.

"Instead, they make communities less safe by interfering with offenders' efforts to reintegrate into safe, stable, and supportive environments," Silverstein said. "And when town after town enacts similar restrictions, it poses the risk that sex offenders are driven underground and disconnected from treatment and supervision."

Jackson said the ordinance pushes offenders into neighboring communities, creating a conflict with the "the state interest in the uniform treatment, management, rehabilitation, and reintegration of sex offenders during and after state supervision."

Officials from Denver also complained that Englewood's policy was forcing offenders into their city, he added.

Silverstein said the ACLU has challenged similar laws in other states, but the Colorado case was different because the agency charged by the state legislature with monitoring paroled sex offenders publicly opposed the measures in Englewood and other towns.

"What sets this apart is the Sex Offender Management Board urged them (municipalities) not to enact theses ordinances," he said.

Englewood's deputy city manager, Michael Flaherty, said the city's legal staff was reviewing the opinion before deciding its next step.

California said on Thursday it would consider a soft launch of its Obamacare online health insurance exchange if tests of the new system next month show it isn't ready to accommodate wide public access.

If the system is not ready, the exchange would at first use an "aided enrollment" in which counselors help California residents sign up over the phone or in person.

Under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, millions of uninsured Americans will be able to sign up for new government subsidized health insurance plans starting on October 1 via online exchanges in each state.

But the scale of the effort, and the political resistance to the reform law in many states, has led to delays in implementation and raised questions about whether all 50 states will be ready by that date.

California, which embraced Obamacare early on, is considered one of the most crucial states for the administration's enrollment effort. The Covered California exchange said current tests of its technology are going well, with more complete results expected in early September, according to spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.

"So far everything is looking good," Hidalgo said. "Until the tests are done, we don't know the full extent of the functionality ... We are working to be fully functional by October 1."

Covered California discussed the issue with insurers on Wednesday as part of a regularly scheduled weekly meeting.

Earlier this month, Oregon decided to use a limited enrollment option in the first weeks of October to work through technical and other potential issues with the exchange.

Covered California aims to sign up 1 million to 1.4 million people in 2014. Overall, exchanges across the country are expected to provide coverage for 7 million people next year.

frisk policy that he argues is necessary to fight crime.

The council passed another measure, also opposed by the mayor, that would create a watchdog to monitor the New York Police Department.

The two bills are aimed at restricting police use of the stop-and-frisk policy in which officers in high-crime areas stop people on the basis of reasonable suspicion that they could be engaged in criminal activity.

The policy, strongly defended by Bloomberg, has come under increasing criticism, particularly from a federal judge who ruled it unconstitutional earlier this month.

Bloomberg released a strongly worded statement about the council, saying the votes were "an example of election year politics at its very worst and political pandering at its most deadly."

"Both bills outsource management of the NYPD to unaccountable officials, making it harder for the next mayor and police commissioner to make the decisions they believe necessary to keep our city safe," he said.

The council's inspector general bill creates an independent monitor over the police department for a seven-year period that would make recommendations on how the department could be improved. It passed by a vote of 39 to 10.

The stop-and-frisk measure expands the definition of racial profiling and allows people who believe they have been profiled to sue police in state court. It passed by a vote of 34-15.

"It's an historic day," said Council member Jumaane Williams, the lead sponsor of the bill. "We have a lot more work left to do. But I'm very happy that the council did its job, moving in the right direction when others wouldn't."

The city has taken the first steps toward an appeal of the ruling by U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin, who called stop-and-frisk "indirect racial profiling" that targeted racially defined groups, resulting in the disproportionate and discriminatory stopping of blacks and Hispanics.

Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly have argued that police make the most stops in minority neighborhoods because that is where crime rates are highest.

The council's inspector general bill takes effect on January 1, 2014, when the city will have a new mayor. The racial profiling bill takes effect in 90 days.

In June, the 51-member council passed the two laws with just enough support to override a veto.

Bloomberg vetoed the bills in July, challenging the council to override him with a two-thirds majority vote.

headline: Atlanta area shooting revives issue of gun access and mental health
byline: By David Beasley
12:12am EDT

47 in a suburban Atlanta elementary school has a history of mental illness and once threatened in a Facebook message to kill his brother, according to the suspect's lawyer and family.

A school clerk convinced Michael Brandon Hill to lay down his gun and turn himself in after he walked into the school carrying 500 rounds of ammunition and briefly exchanged gunfire with police. No students were injured in the incident.

Claudia Saari, a public defender, described Hill as having a "long" history of mental health issues. "Mr. Hill is being represented by members of our Mental Health Division," she said.

The shooting was the latest involving a gunman suffering from a mental health problem, an issue that has raised questions over whether background checks go far enough in examining potential gun buyers.

A spate of shootings at U.S. schools has also reignited a public debate about how to improve safety, with some gun rights advocates calling for more armed security guards and training for teachers to carry weapons.

The Atlanta incident came less than a year after a heavily armed gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, killing 20 children and six adults.

Timothy Hill, the brother of the Atlanta gunman, told police he received threatening messages on Facebook from his brother, including one that stated he would "shoot him in the head and not think twice about it," a December 2012 police report said.

Timothy Hill said at the time "he was in fear for his life" and wanted to pursue charges against his brother, the report said. He told officers his brother was under a doctor's care because of his mental issues, according to the report.

Michael Hill was sentenced in July to three years probation and ordered to attend anger management classes for the threat made against his brother, according to Henry County Court records.

Police in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur and school officials praised Antoinette Tuff, a school clerk at the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy, with preventing a potential tragedy by persuading Hill to put his weapon down and end the ordeal.

"She was just smart enough, brave enough, compassionate enough to stop him," Michael Thurmond, interim superintendent of the DeKalb County school system, told CNN.

In a recording of a 911 call released by police, Tuff can be heard calmly talking Hill out of causing harm and reassuring him that giving up was the right thing to do.

"It's going to be all right sweetheart," she told Hill as he discarded his weapon, emptied his pockets and waited for police to enter the school.

Tuff, who was relaying messages from Hill to police, spoke at length with Hill, telling him "we all go through something in life" and explaining how she tried to commit suicide after her husband of 33 years left her last year.

At the end, Hill lay face down on the floor so police could come in and arrest him.

Tuff can be heard on the 911 call telling the police dispatcher, "I'll buzz them in. Tell them not to come in shooting."

Authorities are trying to piece together how Hill obtained his gun.

47 was purchased by an individual from a federally licensed gun dealer.

She declined to say who purchased the weapon.

Students at the school returned to the building on Thursday for the first time after the shooting, said Quinn Hudson, a DeKalb County school system spokesman.

Crisis counselors were on hand to talk with students, he said.

Students who spoke with counselors were not afraid but wanted "reassurance that everything is OK," Hudson said.



headline: U.S. suspends police assistance for St. Lucia over alleged killings
byline: By Sarah Peter
12:12am EDT

The United States has suspended assistance to the police department of the Caribbean island of St. Lucia as a result of allegations of serious human rights violations, the State Department confirmed on Thursday.

The government of St. Lucia was officially notified of the decision last Friday, the State Department said in a statement.

"The Department of State has made a policy decision to withdraw training and material assistance to the Royal St. Lucia Police force due to credible allegations of gross human rights violations," the statement said.

The island's prime minister, Kenny Anthony, acknowledged the cut off during an address to the nation on Tuesday evening, citing a U.S. law, known as the Leahy amendment after its principal sponsor, Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, which bars aid to foreign security forces accused of human rights violations.

Neither the State Department nor the St. Lucia government was immediately available to give the amount of the assistance.

It was unclear whether the U.S. action would have a significant impact on the small island of 163,000 inhabitants in the eastern Caribbean whose police force suffers from limited resources and is heavily dependent on foreign aid.

The allegations stem from 12 killings committed between 2010 and 2011, some of which were committed by an "ad hoc task force within the police department," a U.S. State Department Human Rights Report said.

The alleged extra-judicial killings stemmed from the circulation of a hit list targeting persons deemed to be criminals. Five suspects whose names were on that list were shot and killed during police operations.

Anthony, during his speech on Tuesday, confirmed seeing such a list while he was in the opposition.

The killings occurred during a government led by the United Workers Party under the leadership of then Prime Minister Stephenson King.

At the time, King issued a warning to criminals prior to the commencement of a police action, dubbed Operation Restore Confidence, saying they would be "hunted down," Anthony noted in his speech.

The prime minister promised to take immediate action to deal with the matter. "It is in our vital interest to maintain close ties of cooperation with the United States in security matters," he said, adding that he has invited CARICOM, the regional Caribbean community of nations, to identify three senior investigators to probe the killings.

"The investigators will be asked to evaluate all available evidence and determine whether or not these matters warrant further action," he said.

Anthony also said he planned to draw up new legislation to investigate extra-judicial police killings. "This measure is needed to ensure that a mechanism exists to deal with such situations in the future, should such unexplained or suspicious deaths occur."



headline: U.S. sues Texas over voter ID law
byline: By David Ingram
12:12am EDT

The U.S. government sued on Thursday to keep Texas from carrying out a voter identification requirement enacted in 2011, setting up a new battle between the Obama administration and a state that is a conservative stronghold.

The Justice Department said in a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Corpus Christi that Texas state lawmakers passed the requirement to deny racial minorities the right to vote and, unlike other states with similar laws, failed to take steps to prevent the law from being discriminatory.

A federal court in Washington blocked the Texas law in August 2012, but its ruling was undone in June when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

"We will not allow the Supreme Court's recent decision to be interpreted as open season for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights," U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement.

Separately, the Justice Department filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff in a Texas redistricting lawsuit brought on behalf of minority voters.

Voter ID laws - which require government-issued identification before voting - have become a political and racial flashpoint across the country. Democrats generally oppose the measures and many Republicans back them.

Supporters say they are needed to deter people from illegally casting ballots, while opponents say voter fraud is exaggerated in order to mask purposeful suppression of Democratic constituencies.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, called the Justice Department suit "gutter politics" and "offensive to the overwhelming majority of Texans of all races who support this ballot integrity measure." He has said he will defend the state's voter ID law and redistricting plans in court.

In its ruling a year ago, the federal court in Washington said Texas failed to ensure that voters could obtain ID cards free of charge, noting that people would have to pay to obtain a certified copy of their birth certificate or other proof of their ID and travel to a state office to present it.

Critics argue that such conditions effectively deny voting rights to people without means.

The courts and the Justice Department have allowed voter ID laws in states that guaranteed that voters would face no additional costs as a result of the laws.

Voting rights lawyers have said they expect the Justice Department to sue other jurisdictions, possibly North Carolina over its new voter ID law, as it looks for ways to protect minority voters.

Without naming any states, Holder, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said that the Texas lawsuit "represents the department's latest action to protect voting rights, but it will not be our last."

pro football player Odin Lloyd.

Hernandez, a former New England Patriots tight end, appeared briefly in Attleboro District Court after being indicted in the shooting of Lloyd, whose bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial area near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

Hernandez, who did not speak during Thursday's brief hearing, has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts, including murder and weapons charges tied to Lloyd's death.

"Aaron Hernandez is an innocent man as we stand here today," Michael Fee, one of his attorneys, told reporters after the hearing. "There has been an incredible rush to judgment in this case ... It has been based on innuendo, misrepresentations of facts, hearsay and opinion has been represented as fact."

The indictment means the case will move to state superior court in Fall River, said Bristol District Attorney Sam Sutter.

"The investigation is ongoing," Sutter told reporters outside the court. "This was a very grave case. My heart goes out to the Lloyd family."

Hernandez, 23, was cut from the Patriots on June 26, shortly after police arrested him for purportedly orchestrating the execution-style murder.

Lloyd, 27, had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancĂŠe. Prosecutors said Hernandez soured on him a few nights before the body was found, and that the two had argued after Lloyd socialized at a nightclub with people Hernandez disliked.

Two other men have been arrested in connection with the case. Ernest Wallace, who turned himself in to police in Florida, has been accused of being an accessory after the fact, and Carlos Ortiz was arrested in Connecticut on charges of being a fugitive from justice.

Before his arrest, Hernandez had been a rising star in the NFL with a $41 million contract with one of the league's top teams.



headline: Massive fire near Yosemite National Park triples in size overnight
byline: By Laila Kearney
4:46am EDT

A wildfire raging out of control near Yosemite National Park in northern California ballooned to nearly 54,000 acres on Thursday, more than tripling in size from the day before, forest officials said.

The blaze, which is burning mostly in Stanislaus National Forest and has destroyed two homes and seven outbuildings since it broke out on Saturday, was only 2 percent contained despite efforts of more than 1,360 firefighters to tame it, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Trevor Augustino.

Augustino said the Rim Fire, named after a popular local lookout point, Rim of the World, is burning on rugged and remote terrain, which has made it challenging for firefighters to haul in hoses to damp the flames.

"The terrain is so difficult that you can't go into direct attack," Augustino said, adding that he expected a lot more firefighters to arrive on Friday as reinforcements.

The Rim Fire is the fourth-largest and fastest growing wildfire in the nation, said National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Robyn Broyles. It is one of 50 large wildfires burning throughout the U.S. West.

On Wednesday, the fire had been 5 percent contained and ranged across only 16,000 acres, but it grew dramatically overnight and the containment level fell.

Two evacuation centers have been set up for residents in the area, Augustino said.

Residents have been urged, but not required, to leave their homes if they have health conditions that could be affected by the rising level of smoke in the air, Augustino said. He said he did not know how many residents had chosen to evacuate or were using the shelters.

"There are a lot of little pockets of residences throughout this area," he said, adding that the fire has started to spread to private land and was roughly five miles from the northwest outer edge of Yosemite National Park.

Yosemite National Park, spanning 750,000-acres and best known for its waterfalls, attracted nearly 4 million visitors in 2012, according to the park website.

Park officials on Tuesday were forced to stop westbound traffic on Highway 120, one of four access routes to the park, due to the fire. But they have no immediate plans to close the park, said Yosemite park ranger Scott Gediman. He added that the sky was clear and free of smoke over Yosemite on Thursday.

The cause of the Rim Fire is unknown and under investigation, Augustino said

A tour bus ferrying passengers to a California casino skidded and flipped onto its side on a freeway outside Los Angeles on Thursday, injuring about 50 people who were thrown around inside the vehicle, authorities said.

No one died in the accident, said Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Captain Brian Jordan.

The crash left the bus, operated by Da Zhen Bus company, on its side on a dirt embankment next to the eastbound lanes of the Foothill Freeway in Irwindale, less than 20 miles east of Los Angeles. Traffic along the freeway at one point was snarled for six miles , said California Highway Patrol spokesman Officer Saul Gomez.

The tour bus was carrying Chinese-speaking passengers, apparently residents of greater Los Angeles, who were traveling to a local Indian casino, Gomez said.

A total of 55 people were hurt in the crash, including about 50 on board the bus and a few people in two other vehicles struck by the bus, Gomez said. Most were transported to local hospitals but some were treated at scene, he said.

Five patients needing immediate care were airlifted to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center and their conditions were guarded but stable with none in surgery, Dr. Leo Rodriguez, who was caring for patients from the crash, told reporters outside the hospital.

They had suffered "blunt force trauma from a rollover bus accident," he said.

The passengers aboard the bus were 50 years and older, Rodriguez said.

Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena received the other three most seriously injured patients - an 86-year-old man with rib fractures and two women in their 70s, said hospital spokesman Kevin Andrus. None of their injuries were life-threatening, he said.

The bus went into a "lockwheel skid" before it turned over and ended up on its side next to the freeway, Gomez said. The cause of the crash is under investigation, he said.

A representative from Da Zhen Bus declined to comment.



headline: Bradley Manning wants to live as a woman named Chelsea
byline: By Susan Heavey and Ian Simpson
12:12am EDT

Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier sentenced to 35 years in military prison for the biggest breach of classified documents in the nation's history, said on Thursday he is female and wants to live as a woman named Chelsea.

Manning, 25, launched an unprecedented bid to get female hormone treatment in a military prison a day after he was sentenced for leaking documents to the WikiLeaks website.

"As I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know the real me. I am Chelsea Manning, I am a female," Manning said in the statement read by anchorwoman Savannah Guthrie on NBC News' "Today" show.

During the sentencing phase of Manning's court-martial for leaking more than 700,000 secret documents, defense attorneys pointed out that the soldier suffered from gender identity disorder. A psychologist testified Manning had a difficult time adjusting to the "hypermasculine environment" of a combat zone.

Manning said in the statement that he wished to begin receiving hormone therapy while serving his sentence in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

A spokeswoman said the Army did not provide hormone therapy or gender-reassignment surgery, but that military inmates have access to mental health professionals, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, social workers and behavioral science specialists.

"Given the way that I feel and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible," Manning said in the statement. "I also request that starting today you refer to me by my new name and use the feminine pronoun."

Manning's lawyer David Coombs said on the TV program he expected his client to get a pardon from U.S. President Barack Obama. Manning, who was convicted last month at Fort Meade, Maryland, on 20 charges, including espionage and theft, could be eligible for parole in seven years.

During the trial, Coombs had argued that Manning had been increasingly isolated and under intense stress when he leaked the files, and that his superiors had ignored warning signs.

Coombs said his client was not seeking gender-reassignment surgery, but he would press Fort Leavenworth to provide hormone therapy for Manning.

"I'm hoping that Fort Leavenworth will do the right thing and provide that. If Fort Leavenworth does not, then I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that they are forced to do so," Coombs said.

'COMFORTABLE IN HER SKIN'

Asked if Manning wanted to be sent to a women's prison, Coombs said no.

"I think the ultimate goal is to be comfortable in her skin and to be the person that she's never had an opportunity to be," he said.

Coombs said he was not worried about Manning's safety in a military prison since inmates there were first-time offenders who wanted to complete their sentences and get out.

Experts generally view military prisons as safer than civilian prisons since the inmates are accustomed to hierarchy and discipline.

Manning had not wanted his sexual identity issues to become public, but they did after his arrest in 2010, Coombs said.

"Now that it is (public), unfortunately you have to deal with it in a public manner," he said.

A psychiatrist, Navy Reserve Captain David Moulton, testified during Manning's trial that the soldier suffered from gender dysphoria, or wanting to be the opposite sex, as well as narcissism and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Geoffrey Corn, a military law expert at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, called Manning's bid for hormone treatment the first of its kind for the military. Openly gay members were barred from serving until the Pentagon's "don't ask, don't tell" policy was repealed in 2011.

"We don't have any precedent for the application of military medical care for elective gender reassignment therapy," he said.

Corn was skeptical that Manning would get approval for hormone therapy since federal courts have traditionally given the military deference for its life and activities.

"I don't see it happening," he said.

Chase Stangio, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Project, said in a statement that the Army's saying it did not provide hormone therapy raised "serious constitutional issues."

Courts have consistently found that denying medical care for gender dysphoria to prisoners based on blanket exclusions violates the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which bars cruel and unusual punishment, Stangio said.

called abortion pill to have full surgical facilities, a requirement it says would halt abortion services at a central Indiana clinic.

Under the law, Planned Parenthood would have to upgrade its clinic in Lafayette, Indiana, to surgical standards or stop administering RU-486, commonly called the abortion pill, it said in a lawsuit filed in Indianapolis federal court.

Imposing surgical facility requirements on clinics where no surgery is performed "is not only unreasonable, it is utterly irrational ...," Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky said in the lawsuit, which seeks a federal court injunction.

Legislators supporting the law that took effect July 1 have said it would protect women's health. It requires clinics providing non-surgical abortions to have separate procedure, recovery and scrub rooms like surgical centers starting January 1.

Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a statement on Thursday that, "We look forward to respectfully asserting the state's case" in defending the constitutionality of the law.

Planned Parenthood operates four of the 10 clinics that provide abortions in Indiana. Three Planned Parenthood clinics perform surgical abortions and administer the abortion pill at up to nine weeks of pregnancy. The Lafayette clinic offers only the abortion pill at up to nine weeks of pregnancy.

The Lafayette clinic provided 54 non-surgical abortions in the 12 months ended July 1, and other medication, primarily contraception, more than 10,000 times, the lawsuit said.

If the Lafayette clinic stops providing non-surgical abortions, the closest clinics are 60 miles away in Indianapolis or 85 miles in Merrilville, Planned Parenthood said, adding that the Lafayette clinic would continue to provide health services.

Planned Parenthood applied on July 15 with Indiana state health officials for a license and a waiver of the requirements.

The Indiana law exempts physician's offices from the requirements as long as surgical procedures performed there are not primarily surgical abortions and abortion-inducing drugs are not the primarily prescribed drugs.

The requirements violate a woman's constitutional right to privacy, equal protection and are "arbitrary and irrational" in violation of a woman's right to due process, the lawsuit said.

The two-pill abortion medication called RU-486 has been legally available in the United States since 2000. By 2008 it accounted for about one-fourth of U.S. abortions performed before nine weeks of gestation, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports the right to abortion.

As approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the drugs are dispensed by prescription directly from a physician. They are not available in pharmacies.



headline: U.S. soldier behind Afghan massacre apologizes for 'act of cowardice'
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
12:12am EDT

A decorated U.S. soldier who gunned down 16 unarmed Afghan civilians in a nighttime rampage last year apologized on Thursday at a sentencing hearing to determine his fate, calling the killings "an act of cowardice."

Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, a veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, has admitted to shooting the villagers, mostly women and children, in attacks on their family compounds in Kandahar province in March 2012.

"I am truly, truly sorry to all the people whose family members I have taken away. I have murdered their families," Bales told a jury in a military courtroom in Washington state, choking up at times. "What I did is an act of cowardice."

Bales pleaded guilty to the killings in June in a deal that will spare him the death penalty. A jury of six military personnel will ultimately decide if he will spend the rest of his natural life in prison or be eligible for parole after 20 years. Closing arguments are due on Friday.

Defense lawyers have been seeking to show that Bales suffered a breakdown under the pressure of his final deployment to Afghanistan. They have argued that he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his last deployment to Afghanistan.

"I don't think anybody with a rational mind could say Bob Bales didn't snap," Browne told reporters on Wednesday after the court-martial session before a military jury.

Army prosecutors have said Bales acted alone and with premeditation when, armed with a pistol, a rifle and a grenade launcher, he left his base twice during the night, returning in the middle of his rampage to tell a fellow soldier, "I just shot up some people."

The killings marked the worst case of civilian deaths blamed on a U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.

ANGER ISSUES

Speaking slowly and deliberately, Bales told the jury he had struggled with anger issues that worsened after his third military deployment.

He said trivial issues like dirty dishes in the sink would make him angry, and that he was "mad at myself for being mad." He briefly sought treatment between his third and fourth deployments, but felt it was not working and stopped.

"I was a coward for stopping. If you have a problem and you seek help, it's not weakness, it's strength," he said. Under military court rules, he was not subject to cross examination.

Prosecutors had said they hoped to show that Bales had a pattern of bad behavior that predated his deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.

The prosecution rested its case on Wednesday after calling witnesses that included nine Afghans who had been flown to the United States to testify, among them a man who lost six of his seven children and other members of his family. Army spokeswoman Major Allison Aguilar said those witnesses had been given the opportunity to be in the courtroom but they were not present for Bales' statement.

"I hope that the people that traveled so far to come here, I hope they translate this so I can tell them I'm sorry. If I could bring their family members back, I would in a heartbeat. I can't comprehend their loss. I think about it every time I look at my kids," Bales said.

A father of two, Bales also apologized to his military colleagues, fighting back tears as he spoke.

"I love the Army. I stood next to some really good guys, some real heroes," he said. "I can't say I'm sorry to those guys enough."

Bales, who has claimed his memory of the killings is spotty, acknowledged them upon pleading guilty in June and told the court at that time there was "not a good reason in this world" for his actions.

During a nine-day pre-trial hearing last fall, witnesses testified that Bales had been upset by a bomb blast near his outpost that severed a fellow soldier's leg days before the shootings.



headline: Obama unveils plan that aims to make college more affordable
byline: By Jeff Mason and Elvina Nawaguna
12:12am EDT

President Barack Obama on Thursday proposed a plan to tackle soaring U.S. education costs with a new system that judges colleges and universities on their financial value and ties those ratings to disbursement of federal aid.

The president, who has spent much of the summer promoting new ideas to rev up the economy, unveiled his proposals at the start of a campaign-like bus tour through New York and Pennsylvania.

The plan calls on the Education Department to institute a new ratings system before the 2015 school year that would allow students and parents to select schools based on the best value for the money.

Obama would then push Congress to tie federal student aid to these ratings by 2018, creating an incentive for schools to keep their costs in check.

The plan also aims to ease the pain of federal student loan debt by limiting those payments to 10 percent of borrowers' monthly income.

Major parts of the plan require congressional approval, which may prove difficult. And universities, many of which are already facing a cash crunch, are expected to push back against a ratings system that may be more difficult to influence than private-sector ranking systems.

After landing in Buffalo and greeting Governor Andrew Cuomo - a potential Democratic candidate for president in 2016 - Obama boarded a big black bus that appeared to be the one that took him through political swing states last year during his re-election battle against Republican Mitt Romney.

The campaign atmosphere is part of a White House strategy to generate attention for the president's proposals and gear up for a fall fight with congressional Republicans over the budget, debt ceiling and implementation of the president's signature healthcare reform, known as Obamacare.

Obama began his remarks at The State University of New York with an attack on Republicans for continuing their quest to repeal the health law. Republican lawmakers are considering using an upcoming showdown over the U.S. borrowing limit as leverage to delay the law's implementation.

But his main focus was education. Obama wants to bring down tuition costs at U.S. colleges and universities, which have skyrocketed, forcing students and families to take on more debt to afford a college degree.

"At a time when a higher education has never been more important or more expensive, too many students are facing a choice that they should never have to make," Obama said.

"Either they say no to college, and pay the price for not getting a degree ... or you do what it takes to go to college, but then you run the risk that you won't be able to pay it off because you've got so much debt."

The average annual cost of in-state tuition and fees for 2013 at four-year public universities was $8,655, up 4.8 percent from 2012, according to a survey from the College Board released this month.

Private colleges and universities are vastly more expensive.

The federal government provides more than $150 billion in student financial aid each year, and typically that aid has been based on enrollment figures, not the value of the education.

REPUBLICAN CONCERNS

John Kline, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce, expressed reservations about Obama's plan.

"I remain concerned that imposing an arbitrary college ranking system could curtail the very innovation we hope to encourage - and even lead to federal price controls," he said in a statement.

Andrew Kelly, director of the Center on Higher Education at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the president's proposals could motivate institutions to make some changes. But he said higher education lobbyists and some lawmakers may argue such a system could create a great disparity among colleges.

"The political fight is going to be very interesting," he said.

Secretary of Education Arne Duncan told reporters traveling with Obama on Air Force One earlier on Thursday that the system would still leave aid options open for students who chose pricier institutions.

"Folks will still have choice, but we want to make sure that good actors are being rewarded," he said.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the total cost of higher education - including tuition, room and board - for undergraduates at four-year public institutions ballooned 73 percent to an average of $15,900 per year in 2011 compared to 2001.

Americans now owe about $1.2 trillion in student loan debt, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimates. Obama said that debt was crippling to the U.S. economy.

If costs put college out of reach for too many young people, the United States could find itself at a disadvantage compared to other countries.

Obama earlier this month signed legislation that reversed a big hike in student loan interest rates and will tie future rates to fluctuations in the 10-year Treasury note. The bill was hammered out in intensive negotiations with lawmakers.

Over the last five years, the president has rolled out a number of college affordability initiatives, including increasing Pell Grant aid to low-income students, steps to encourage colleges to be more transparent about costs, and awarding grants to states and institutions that work to bring costs down.



headline: Kidnapped California teen taken to Idaho calls herself a survivor
byline: By Dan Whitcomb and Marty Graham
1:08am EDT

old California girl kidnapped by a man and taken to Idaho after he killed her mother and younger brother, said in a television interview that she considers herself a survivor who was raised to be strong.

The interview, which aired on Wednesday, comes just over a week after Anderson was rescued in the Idaho wilderness by FBI agents who shot and killed her captor, 40-year-old James Lee DiMaggio.

Anderson's statements to NBC, in her first mainstream media interview since the ordeal, were aired on the network's "Nightly News" as a snippet of a full interview to be shown Thursday morning on the "Today" program.

"In the beginning, I was a victim but now, knowing everyone out there is helping me, I consider myself a survivor instead," Anderson told NBC News.

"My mom raised me to be strong," she said.

Anderson is believed to have taken to the social media website ask.fm just days after her rescue to field dozens of questions from strangers about her kidnapping, but she has otherwise remained silent about what she endured.

DNA TESTS CONSIDERED

In other developments on Wednesday, a spokesman for DiMaggio's family said they want more answers from police and have considered seeking DNA tests to determine if DiMaggio was the biological father of Hannah Anderson and her slain 8-year-old brother, Ethan.

old Christina Anderson and her son, Ethan, and set fire to his rural San Diego area home, which was discovered burning on August 4, Andrew Spanswick told Reuters in an interview.

Spanswick was a friend of both DiMaggio and his sister, Lora Robinson, and has acted as a spokesman for the DiMaggio family.

"Lora is in a position of extreme grief and distress and she's looking for any sort explanation of how her brother could have changed from the person she knew into what he is accused of," Spanswick said of DiMaggio's sister.

The remains of Christina Anderson were found under a tarp in DiMaggio's log-cabin-style home in Boulevard, about 25 miles east of San Diego, and an autopsy found she died from blunt force trauma to the head.

The badly burned body of Ethan Anderson was found in a different part of the wreckage than his mother.

DiMaggio was discovered with Hannah Anderson on August 10 at a mountain lake in the remote Idaho wilderness and was shot to death by an FBI agent during an operation to rescue the girl.

Police have described DiMaggio as a longtime friend of Christina Anderson who was treated like an uncle to her children Hannah and Ethan.

Spanswick said members of DiMaggio's family had not made a formal request for DNA from Hannah or Ethan Anderson, but have raised the issue as they seek a fuller understanding of the events leading up to the murders and kidnapping.

A San Diego County Sheriff's spokesman, Jan Caldwell, said on Wednesday that no requests had been made to the department for DNA from Ethan Anderson. Representatives of the Anderson family could not be reached for comment.

Caldwell said that sheriff's investigators had confirmed that DiMaggio and Hannah Anderson were photographed in his car at 12:10 a.m. on August 4, some 20 hours before the house went up in flames.

Christina and Ethan Anderson were last seen alive on August 3 at their home in the San Diego community of Lakeside, and Hannah Anderson was picked up from a high school cheerleading event at Sweetwater High School in nearby National City that afternoon.

Authorities have not publicly discussed any possible motives for DiMaggio's actions. A family friend has said the suspect developed an apparent infatuation with the high school girl that made Hannah feel uncomfortable.



headline: Reality TV star becomes latest woman to accuse San Diego mayor of groping
byline: By Marty Graham
1:08am EDT

A former star of a reality TV show on Wednesday became the 18th woman to publicly accuse San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of groping or other inappropriate behavior, as settlement talks in a sexual harassment suit against him entered a third day.

Filner, meanwhile, was spotted inside City Hall on Wednesday in what was believed to be the first sighting of him there since he took a brief leave of absence to enter behavioral modification therapy early this month.

But neither his office nor his lawyers have replied to repeated queries this week about whether the 70-year-old Democrat and former U.S. congressman has fully resumed his duties as the top elected official of California's second-largest city.

Filner has come under mounting pressure to resign amid a torrent of sexual harassment allegations leveled at him, starting with his former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, who sued the mayor and the city on July 22.

Negotiations aimed at reaching a settlement of the litigation began on Monday at a downtown office building near City Hall, according to Jackson's attorney, Gloria Allred.

Allred said the sessions were presided over by a retired federal judge, J. Lawrence Irving, a respected mediator, who has asked all parties to refrain from discussing the talks publicly.

At least two City Council members were present for the first two days of the talks, and one of them, Council President Todd Gloria, was there as negotiations resumed for a third day on Wednesday afternoon, his spokesman, Katie Keach, told Reuters.

Officials from the city attorney's office and Filner's lawyers also were believed to be taking part in the sessions, and Filner himself was seen entering that office building on Monday.

There was no word on whether any progress had been made toward resolving the case. Allred declined to comment except to say, "The mediation is ongoing."

'ADDICTED TO BEAUTY'

Since Jackson filed her suit last month, 17 more women have come forward to accuse Filner of making unwanted advances, the latest being Dianne York, 50, who starred in a short-lived reality show about cosmetic surgery on the Oxygen Channel cable network called "Addicted to Beauty."

York, who has acknowledged on the show's website that she has undergone "more than five and less than 10" cosmetic surgical procedures herself, was depicted on the series as launching a business partnership with a prominent plastic surgeon to open a day spa in San Diego.

At a news conference on Wednesday, York said the mayor put his hand on her buttocks when she posed with him for a photo at his office in May following a meeting to discuss what she called an illegal foreclosure on her business, the Spa of La Jolla.

"I was shocked," she said. "It was inappropriate." She gave few other details except to say she reported the incident to the county sheriff's department, which has set up a hot line to field complaints about alleged misconduct by the mayor.

County court records show York has been involved in more than a dozen lawsuits during the past three years, some of them disputes with her own attorneys.

Among the other women who have alleged sexual harassment by Filner were a retired U.S. Navy admiral, a college dean, a licensed vocational nurse, several business women and two military veterans who were victims of unrelated sexual assaults in the armed forces.

Filner has so far refused to step down but has apologized for what he acknowledged was a pattern of disrespectful and intimidating behavior toward women.

On August 5, he entered a treatment at an undisclosed behavioral counseling clinic. His lawyers said he left the clinic after several days but was taking additional time off last week before planning to return to work this week.

On Sunday, volunteers began collecting signatures for a petition seeking to oust Filner through a recall election. Organizers said that as of Tuesday night they had collected 11,000 of the 102,000 signatures needed by September 26 to qualify a recall for the ballot.

sex marriage licenses.

He said the first same-sex couple that walked in to obtain a license said they had waited 31 years to wed.

"Maybe I'm jumping the gun, but so be it," Ellins said, adding he supports gay marriage because he believes "equal protection should apply to everyone."

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage. Unlike in many other states, New Mexico residents have never voted to ban same-sex marriage and state law does not expressly permit or prohibit such unions, said Phil Sisneros, a spokesman for New Mexico Attorney General Gary King.

King, a Democrat, told reporters on Wednesday he would not seek to stop the Do単a Ana county clerk or any other county clerk in the state from issuing same-sex marriage licenses.

In 2004, the county clerk in Sandoval County, New Mexico, began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but stopped doing so after then-Attorney General Patricia Madrid, also a Democrat, issued an interpretation of state law saying gay and lesbian marriage was not legal in New Mexico.

At least two lawsuits by same-sex couples seeking the right to marry are working their way through the New Mexico court system, Sisneros said.

Ellins said he was emboldened to issue same-sex marriage licenses after King in June submitted a friend-of-the-court brief to the New Mexico Supreme Court suggesting the state's long-standing denial of same-sex marriage rights violated the equal protection provisions of the state constitution.

The New Mexico Supreme Court has declined to rule on whether gay marriage is allowed in the state, sending the matter to lower courts, Sisneros said.

The county clerk said he also felt bolstered by a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June that struck down part of the 1996 National Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman and denied benefits to same-sex married couples. "That's a strong signal," Ellins said.

Do単a Ana County, which borders Texas and Mexico, has a population of about 215,000 and its county seat is Las Cruces.

Some same-sex couples who showed up in Las Cruces to obtain marriage licenses came from Texas, where gay marriage is banned, Ellins said.

Maggie Gallagher, an opponent of same-sex marriage and a board member with the American Principles Project, criticized the move by Ellins, saying he should allow the courts to decide whether same-sex marriage should proceed in New Mexico.

"Bypassing that process is lawless and in itself unconstitutional and politically motivated," she said.

strapped municipalities.

The announcement on Wednesday is a warning to around 200 other municipalities in the state that have deferred more than $2 billion in pension payments over the last three years.

"Deferring current operating expenses to (a) future period is inconsistent with our view of strong financial management," Moody's Investors Service said in a statement. "Continued amortization of annual pension payments could result in a downgrade."

Moody's current Aaa rating for Huntington is the highest investment grade, but the negative outlook means the rating could be cut to Aa1, potentially pushing up the town's borrowing costs. The outlook affects $112 million in outstanding debt and a previously unrated $13.4 million of public improvement bonds.

Municipalities pay contributions for their public employees into a $160 billion system that is administered by the state.

Moody's and Huntington did not respond to requests for comment.

Reuters reported earlier this year that public pension system deferrals by New York's municipalities had quadrupled since 2011 and could accelerate under new rules introduced this year that allow municipalities to divert even more pension money.

Public employers deferred $1.1 billion in the fiscal year ended in March 2013, up from $293.2 million in 2011, a near fourfold increase, according to data from the New York state's Comptroller's office.

The number of public employers using deferrals jumped to nearly 200 in the fiscal year just ended from around 50 two years earlier. About 3,000 employers pay into the system.

The Comptroller's office, which signed off on more liberal deferral rules introduced by state Governor Andrew Cuomo for the current fiscal year, declined to comment.

The Moody's report said Huntingdon had deferred about one-third of required contributions last year. The required payments are determined by actuaries who match future pension obligations with current payment needs.

The deferral program, known as amortization, is designed to help municipalities bridge a spike in contribution rates following the financial crisis. Contributions are expected to fall after 2015, following years of strong market performance.

This year the amounts that the state's municipal employers are required to pay by actuarial formulas are 20.5 percent of the annual wage bills for the Employees Retirement System (ERS) and 28.9 percent for the Police and Fire Retirement System (PFRS).

In 2001, the year after the bubble in technology stocks had peaked, the rates were 0.9 percent for the ERS and 1.6 percent for the PFRS.

Critics say deferring payments risks undermining the integrity of public pensions by creating unfunded liabilities in the system while simply pushing the financial burdens faced by municipalities further into the future.

headline: Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout argues conviction appeal
byline: By Nate Raymond
1:08am EDT

Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout urged a U.S. appeals court on Thursday to reverse his 2011 conviction for conspiracy to kill Americans, arguing he was a victim of a "vindictive" prosecution.

Albert Dayan, a lawyer for Bout, said there was no legitimate law enforcement reason for targeting a man he claimed evidence showed was no longer in the arms business.

Bout, 46, is serving a 25-year prison sentence for conspiring to sell arms to people he thought were Colombian rebels who intended to kill U.S. soldiers. His case has strained relations between Washington and Moscow, which has demanded the return of the onetime Soviet air force officer.

Bout, the subject of the book "Merchant of Death" and the inspiration for Nicholas Cage's character in the 2005 movie "Lord of War," supplied military-grade weaponry to conflict zones around the world, according to prosecutors.

He was arrested in Bangkok in 2008 in a sting operation in which U.S. informants posed as representatives of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

Prosecutors said Bout demonstrated an intent to sell a massive arsenal of weaponry to FARC to use against American personnel in Colombia. He was extradited to New York in 2010.

A jury found him guilty in November 2011 on two counts of conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers of the United States, and one count each of conspiracy to sell anti-aircraft missiles and providing material support to a terrorist organization.

In his appeal, Bout contends he was convicted on an "non-crime" in a case initiated by the National Security Agency or White House and carried out by the DEA for political reasons.

"It's seldom the DEA receives orders from the White House to deliver someone's head on a silver platter," Dayan said at a hearing before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday.

Anjan Sahni, a lawyer for the Justice Department, said the U.S. government had targeted Bout, but for legitimate reasons, namely "because of the very clear and present danger he posed."

While Bout's lawyer said his client had given up arms dealing by the time of the sting, Sahni said evidence showed he had at the time been engaged in potential deals in places such as Libya and Tanzania.

"There's not remotely any abuse of discretion in this case," Sahni said.

Members of the three-judge appellate panel posed a series of seemingly skeptical questions to arguments by Dayan.

"Why are these weapons being sold?" Circuit Judge Danny Chin asked. "Isn't it the logical conclusion they're being sold to kill someone?"



headline: Doctors to take stand for U.S. soldier's defense in Afghan massacre case
byline: By Jonathan Kaminsky
1:08am EDT

Attorneys for the U.S. soldier who massacred 16 unarmed Afghan civilians last year will call witnesses on Thursday as they try to show he suffered a breakdown under the pressure of his final deployment to Afghanistan.

The first witnesses to be called by the defense in the sentencing phase of Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales' trial will be a number of medical doctors flown in from across the United States, his attorney John Henry Browne told reporters.

Defense testimony on Wednesday appeared aimed at telling the story of Bales' transformation from a dutiful young man to a soldier who his civilian attorney says broke under the pressure of overseas deployment.

"I don't think anybody with a rational mind could say Bob Bales didn't snap," Browne told reporters on Wednesday after the court-martial session before a military jury.

A decorated veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, Bales pleaded guilty in June in a deal that will spare him the death penalty. The jury will decide if he will spend the rest of his life in prison or if he will be eligible for parole after 20 years.

After Bales' brother testified on his behalf of Wednesday, Browne he planned to call up to 10 more witnesses, including Bales himself and the doctors.

William Bales on Wednesday described his brother as a good-natured young man who felt duty-bound to enlist in the Army in the aftermath of al Qaeda attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.

The prosecution rested its case on Wednesday after calling to the stand a string of witnesses including nine Afghans, among them a man who lost six of his seven children.

They testified to the devastating toll inflicted by Bales on civilians before dawn on March 11, 2012, during two forays from his military base in Kandahar province.

Bales' attorneys have said he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his deployment to Afghanistan.

Browne said on Wednesday that the defense's final witness would be Bales himself, who under military court rules would be exempt from cross-examination.

The killings marked the worst case of civilian deaths blamed on a rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.



headline: San Diego mayor accused of harassment reaches proposed settlement
byline: By Marty Graham
1:08am EDT

San Diego Mayor Bob Filner and the city reached a proposed settlement on Wednesday in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by his former press secretary, the city attorney told reporters.

The disclosure of the settlement on the third day of negotiations came on the same day a former star of a reality television show became the 18th woman to publicly accuse Filner of groping or other inappropriate behavior, in a scandal that has rocked California's second largest city.

Filner has come under mounting pressure to resign amid a torrent of sexual harassment allegations leveled at him, starting with his former press secretary, Irene McCormack Jackson, who sued the mayor and the city on July 22.

The San Diego City Council in July filed a cross-complaint against Filner seeking to recover from him any damages the city might face in the lawsuit.

"We have reached a proposed resolution," City Attorney Jan Goldsmith, who was flanked by two City Council members and attorneys for Filner, told reporters gathered outside the downtown office building where talks were held.

Goldsmith did not disclose the scope of the proposed settlement, but he said that it will be presented to the San Diego City Council in closed session on Friday. "We won't have more to discuss until Friday afternoon," he said.

High-profile attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing the former press secretary, has called for Filner to resign. Goldsmith, who is acting on behalf of the City Council and not the mayor in the case, told local television station KNSD earlier this month that settlement talks would give the mayor a potential "out" to litigation, although Goldsmith stopped short of saying that had to involve the mayor's resignation.

A source close to an individual involved in the talks, when asked whether the proposed settlement would require Filner to resign, said, "I think it's fair to say that looks like it's in the cards."

Filner, meanwhile, was spotted inside City Hall on Wednesday in what was believed to be the first sighting of him there since he took a brief leave of absence to enter behavioral modification therapy early this month.

But neither his office nor his lawyers have replied to repeated queries this week about whether the 70-year-old Democrat and former U.S. congressman has fully resumed his duties as the city's top elected official.

martial on Wednesday without calling any witnesses to testify.

Major Nidal Hasan, acting as his own defense attorney, has remained largely passive in court since telling the jury in opening arguments, "The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter."

Colonel Tara Osborn, a military judge, asked Hasan if anyone had forced him into his decision to dispense with witnesses and rest his case. "No, ma'am," he replied.

On Tuesday, military prosecutors rested their case in the capital murder court-martial of Hasan, an American-born Muslim who said he switched sides in what he considered a U.S. war against Islam.

Hasan spared victims who testified against him from cross-examination and so far has avoided using his court-martial as a platform for his religious beliefs, though he will be given another chance in closing arguments set for Thursday.

Shot by police during the incident, the 42-year-old is paralyzed from the waist down and attends court in a wheelchair.

The shooting rampage on November 5, 2009, came at a time of heightened tensions over the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which strained relations between the United States and countries with predominantly Muslim populations.

Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing, praised Hasan as a hero and "a man of conscience." U.S. intelligence officials say Hasan had sent emails to Awlaki, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011. The judge blocked those emails from being submitted as evidence in the trial.

Prosecutors opted against bringing terrorism charges against Hasan, who could face the death penalty if all 13 officers on the jury find him guilty of premeditated murder.

Hasan faces 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of premeditated attempted murder for the 31 people injured plus one he shot at and missed.

The judge delayed ruling on whether to give the jury the option of considering lesser homicide offenses such as unpremeditated murder or voluntary manslaughter.

When prosecutors argued, with the jury absent, against the option of manslaughter, Hasan interjected. But rather than rebut the prosecution's point, he agreed.

"I would like to agree that it wasn't done under the heat of passion. There was adequate provocation because these were soldiers that were deploying in an illegal war. That was the provocation," Hasan said.

Prosecutors called 89 witnesses in two weeks of testimony, with many describing in horrific detail the bloodbath in and around a medical building at Fort Hood.

Hasan told mental health evaluators he wanted to become a martyr, court documents show. Lawyers assisting him say he is seeking the death penalty, but he has disputed that claim.



headline: Guantanamo guards gave 'Shades of Grey' novel to prisoner, lawyer says

Prison guards gave one of the alleged 9/11 conspirators a copy of the erotic novel "Fifty Shades of Grey," according to a defense lawyer who suggested on Wednesday that the unwanted gift was part of a campaign aimed at discrediting his client.

U.S. Representative Jim Moran of Virginia caused a sensation last month when he returned from a visit to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and quoted guards as saying the soft-porn "Grey" novels were the most-requested reading material among the prison's highest-profile inmates.

It was unclear where the books came from since the detainee library doesn't stock the series, a romance trilogy by British author E.L. James that has topped best-seller lists around the world.

Defense attorney James Connell said his client, Ammar al Baluchi, showed up in court with a copy that he said had been given to him by guards on Monday night.

Baluchi had never heard of the book until he read news accounts of Moran's comments and mistakenly thought it was titled "Thirty Shades of Grey," Connell said.

"You'll never believe what the guards gave to me," Connell quoted Baluchi as saying.

Baluchi didn't want the book and gave it to Connell, who said it would stay locked in his safe until he could turn it over to the legal adviser for Camp 7. That maximum-security facility holds about a dozen captives previously held in CIA custody, including Baluchi and four other defendants charged in the 9/11 attacks.

Connell said giving the book to his client was either a practical joke gone too far or "some kind of disinformation campaign."

The congressman's allegations that the defendants preferred the "Grey" novels to the Koran ran counter to the pious image portrayed when they kneel on the courtroom floor to pray at regular intervals.

Detention camp officials had no comment and have repeatedly said they cannot discuss anything related to Camp 7 and those who live there.

But a lawyer for another 9/11 defendant, Ramzi bin al Shibh, said they had commented quickly enough when his client complained about the lunch service and left court on Tuesday afternoon.

A camp spokesman said bin al Shibh had objected to the absence of olives and honey with his meal. Defense lawyer James Harrington called that an attempt to inaccurately portray bin al Shibh as someone who "blew up over very trivial issues."

He also accused camp officials of "trying to paint a picture of our clients that's clearly not accurate."

Baluchi and bin al Shibh are among five prisoners charged with training and funding the 9/11 hijackers. A weeklong pretrial hearing in the death penalty case is scheduled to continue through Friday.

bound Army man before the attacks, his brother testified at a sentencing hearing on Wednesday.

William Bales spoke warmly of his youngest brother, Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, saying the former high school football player left a carefree bachelor life behind to enlist in the military in the aftermath of al Qaeda attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.

"There's no better father that I've seen," William Bales told a jury of six military personnel tasked with determining his fate. "If you brought the kids in there today they would run right to him."

Bales, a decorated veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, has admitted to gunning down the villagers, mostly women and children, in nighttime attacks on their compounds in Kandahar province in March 2012.

He pleaded guilty in June in a deal that will spare him the death penalty. A military jury will decide if he will spend the rest of his life in prison or if he will be eligible for parole after 20 years.

The killings marked the worst case of civilian deaths blamed on a rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further eroded strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.

The defense testimony on Wednesday appeared aimed at telling the story of Bales' transformation from a dutiful young man to a soldier who his civilian defense attorney says broke under the pressure of his final deployment to Afghanistan.

Defense attorneys for Bales have argued that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his deployment to Afghanistan.

"I don't think anybody with a rational mind could say Bob Bales didn't snap," attorney John Henry Browne told reporters after the session. He said Bales would testify later in the proceedings and apologize for his crimes.

IMPACT OF RAMPAGE

The testimony for the defense was in sharp contrast to that of prosecution witnesses earlier in the day in which Afghan civilians - including a man who lost six of his seven children - testified to the impact of the attacks.

Army prosecutors have said Bales acted alone and with chilling premeditation when, armed with a pistol, a rifle and a grenade launcher, he left his base twice during the night, returning in the middle of his rampage to tell a fellow soldier, "I just shot up some people."

Haji Mohammad Wazir said he had been away when the attack occurred. When he got home he saw the bodies of 11 of his relatives, which had been loaded into a vehicle. Among them were his wife, mother, brother and six of his children.

"If someone loses one child, you can imagine how devastated that person would be," said Wazir, estimated to be in his thirties. His surviving 4-year-old son, who was with him at the time of the killings, "misses everyone" and has not forgotten them, he said.

Bales' brigade commander at the time of the slaughter, Colonel Todd Wood, testified that it would take generations before the United States can regain some of the trust lost in the massacre.

Bales, who has claimed his memories of the killings are spotty, acknowledged the killings upon pleading guilty in June and told the court at the time there was "not a good reason in this world" for his actions.

During a nine-day pre-trial hearing last fall, witnesses testified that Bales had been upset by a bomb blast near his outpost that severed a fellow soldier's leg days before the shootings.

Prosecutors have said they hoped to show Bales had engaged in a pattern of bad behavior that predated his multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Another Afghan witness, 41-year-old Mullah Khamal Adin, Wazir's cousin, testified that he arrived at the scene of one of the attacks to find Wazir's mother shot in the head at the entrance of her home. He found the corpses of other family members inside.

"It was such a devastating incident that I don't think I will ever forget it," Khamal Adin said.

Public schools in Duncan, Oklahoma, were on alert on Wednesday after police received threats against Duncan High School following the arrest of three teenagers in connection with the killing of a university student from Australia.

The school, in a town of 24,000 about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City, was told of the anonymous threats on Tuesday night by police, schools superintendent Sherry Labyer said in a message on the Duncan Public Schools' website. The nature of the threats was not known.

Christopher Lane, 23, of Melbourne, was killed by a gunshot in the back on Friday as he was jogging in Duncan.

Duncan public schools were requiring students to stay on campus until a parent or guardian checked them out, Labyer said. She said children whose parents preferred to keep them home on Wednesday would be excused, Labyer said.

"Please know that we are committed to taking all reasonable action to protect the well-being of our students," said Labyer.

A representative for Duncan High School declined to say if the suspects attended that school, and referred questions to police, who did not immediately return calls for comment.

Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards Jr., 15, have been charged with first degree murder, according to the Stephens County District Attorney's office. Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, has been charged with use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory to murder after the fact, the District Attorney's office said.

All three have been charged as adults, though Jones is considered a youthful offender.

District Attorney Jason Hicks said he intended to pursue adult sentences for all three. In Jones' case that would be 5 years to 45 years for being an accessory after the fact, and 2 years to life for use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon.

"I will be shocked if he is not found to be eligible to be sentenced as an adult," Hicks said of Jones.

off group that didn't seem to care that much."

Cox said the atmosphere "pretty hectic" at his school on Wednesday. "People are either very scared or just not bothered," Cox said. "This is not normal for Duncan ... It's like culture shock."

Lane was jogging during a visit with his girlfriend and her family in Duncan when he was shot, police said. He attended East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma, where he was on a baseball scholarship.

According to police, Jones said the teens decided to kill someone "for the fun of it."

Police said Jones told them on Sunday that the three teenagers saw Lane jogging and decided he would be their target, followed him in their vehicle and then shot him in the back.

If convicted, Luna and Edwards face a possible sentence of life in prison without parole, according to court documents. Under a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, they could not receive the death penalty because of their ages.

The next court hearing for Jones has been scheduled for October 2, and a preliminary hearing for Edwards and Luna has been set for October 16.

headline: Bankruptcy judge considers opening secret Detroit 'data room'

The city of Detroit may have to publicly disclose at least some of the financial information in its digital vault, which includes what the city's fiscal future could look like.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes on Wednesday accepted an offer by Jones Day, the law firm handling the city's July 18 municipal bankruptcy filing, to go through about 7,000 pages of financial information in a digital "data room" in the next few days and identify which documents could be made public.

Rhodes said he will entertain the city's argument to keep some of the data out of the public eye on August 28.

The city, under state-appointed Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr, set up and provided the content for the password-protected data room and allowed access to creditors involved in the historic Detroit bankruptcy filing only if they signed a nondisclosure agreement.

Creditors and Orr's office have not revealed what the data consists of. While it was not intended to be seen by the public, representatives from the city's unions and pension funds as well as corporate creditors have been given the password to it after agreeing to the nondisclosure agreement.

On Wednesday afternoon, Jones Day attorney Gregory Shumaker made the offer to identify documents that should be kept from the public, in a change from insisting that all of them should remain private.

Orr is a former member of Jones Day. He resigned from the firm to take the emergency manager position five months ago.

At a hearing earlier on Wednesday at the federal courthouse in Detroit, Rhodes seemed to take umbrage when Shumaker said some of the financial information in the so-called room was not relevant to the city's Chapter 9 filing.

"This is bankruptcy. What is not relevant?" said Rhodes.

Shumaker seemed taken aback. There are scenarios of what may happen to the city's finances in the future that are best kept private, he said.

"What would be the harm to the city's interest?" countered Rhodes.

In the afternoon session, Shumaker said some personal information of individual pensioners should be kept confidential. He also said that as part of an agreement with the actuarial firm Milliman, which drew up some scenarios for the city's two pension funds, the company insisted that anyone viewing the information sign a nondisclosure agreement.

Rhodes told Shumaker to make sure Milliman representatives were in the court next week to explain why their actuarial research should remain out of the public's view.

On July 10, eight days before Detroit filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, a United Auto Workers attorney, Michael Nicholson, refused to sign the nondisclosure agreement that covered the data as well as discussions held that day in a meeting with Jones Day representatives regarding the city's pensioners.

Nicholson told Rhodes in court Wednesday morning that he was pleased to see a hearing had been set on the potential public release of the information.

Wednesday's hearing had been requested by Syncora Guarantee, the bond insurer that is contesting a creditor agreement Detroit is asking the court to approve. That agreement involves interest-rate swaps related to Detroit pension debt for which Syncora guarantees payment.

Detroit sued Syncora in July after it allegedly told U.S. Bank, which controls the flow of casino funds that were part of a previous agreement with the swap counterparties, not to release up to $11 million a month to Detroit. The hearing did not result in any resolution to the dispute.

Questions regarding information in the data room by Syncora's attorney, Stephen Hackney, led to Rhodes' questioning why the information should be kept confidential.
