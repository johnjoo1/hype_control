VIf you\u2019re an average American and are confused and worried about us getting embroiled in a no-win Syrian civil war, you\u2019re right to be concerned. It means you\u2019re paying attention. But if you\u2019re a member of Congress or a senator who\u2019s still wondering whether to grant President Obama the authority to use force to deter Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from again murdering hundreds of his people with poison gas, it now makes sense to take a timeout. That also means you\u2019re paying attention.\u000a\u000aA new situation has been created in the last two days by the Russian offer \u2014 embraced by Obama, all of our major allies and China, but still only vaguely accepted by Syria \u2014 for Syria to turn over its stockpiles of poison gas to international control. Let\u2019s have no illusion. There\u2019s still a real possibility that the Russians and Syrians are just stalling and will fudge in the end, and even if one or both are serious, there are formidable logistical and political obstacles to securing Syria\u2019s chemical weapons swiftly and completely. Part of me wonders: Has anybody thought this through?\u000a\u000aBut all of me wants to acknowledge that if a Syrian surrender of poison gas were implemented \u2014 still a big if \u2014 it would be a good end to this near-term crisis. The global taboo on poison gas would be upheld, and America would not have to get embroiled in a shooting war in Syria.\u000a\u000aIn that context, I think it is worth Obama and Congress threatening to schedule a vote to endorse Obama\u2019s threat of force \u2014 if the Syrians and Russians don\u2019t act in good faith \u2014 but not schedule a vote right now. (That was essentially the president\u2019s message in his speech Tuesday night.) By \u201cthreatening to threaten,\u201d Obama retains leverage to keep the Syrians and Russians focused on implementing any agreement \u2014 but without having to test Congress\u2019s real willingness to let him fulfill that threat. Because, if it failed to pass, the Russians and Syrians would have no incentive to move.\u000a\u000aIf all of this sounds incredibly messy and confusing, it is. And while Obama and his team have contributed to this mess by way too much loose talk, in fairness, there is also a deep structural reason for it. Obama is dealing with an Arab world that no modern president has had to confront. Until 2010, the Arab Middle East had been relatively stable for 35 years. The combination of the cold war, the rise of oil-funded dictators who built strong security states and the peace between Egypt and Israel imposed order.\u000a\u000aBut the convergence in the 2010s of Arab population explosions, joblessness, environmental degradation, water scarcity, falling oil revenues and the information revolution blew apart regimes that once seemed solid \u2014 Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, Iraq, Libya and Yemen \u2014 forcing us now to confront some new and very uncomfortable questions, not just the use of force.\u000a\u000aOne is this: Are some things true even if George W. Bush believed them? No one, hawk or dove, wants to see American boots on the ground in Syria, under any conditions. Count me among them. The only problem is that it is impossible to imagine a solution to the conflict in Syria without some outside force putting boots on the ground. When you get the degree of state and social breakdown that you have in such a multitribal and multisectarian society as Syria, there is no trust with which to govern and rotate power. Therefore, you need either a midwife or a Mandela or a trusted military (à la Egypt) to referee the transition to a new order. And since Syria has no Mandela and no trusted military, it is going to need an external midwife. I understand why there are no volunteers, but the United Nations Security Council will eventually have to address this reality, otherwise Syria will become Afghanistan on the Mediterranean.\u000a\u000aThere are also some uncomfortable questions we need to pose to our Arab allies. During the cold war, our fear of communism and dependence on oil made us ready to align with anyone who was with us against the Soviets. We never questioned our Arab allies about what values they were promoting at home?\u000a\u000aWell, here is a question we need to start posing: There are reportedly thousands of Arab and Muslim youths who have come from as far away as Australia to join the jihadist militias in Syria fighting to create a Sunni Islamist state there. But how many Arab and Muslim youth have flocked to Syria to fight with the decent elements of the Free Syrian Army for a multisectarian, pluralistic, democratic Syria \u2014 that is, the kind of Syria we hope for and envisage? I have not read of any. Arms purveyors, yes, but not people putting their own lives on the line.\u000a\u000aI am glad that Arab Gulf leaders are supporting us publicly \u2014 most of them are moderates in the Middle East context \u2014 but everyone knows that mosques and charities in those same countries are financing the jihadists. Attention: With the Soviets and the oil lines gone, Americans today are not going to expend blood and treasure to defend people and places in the Arab world that don\u2019t share our values and are also not ready to sacrifice for them. We can\u2019t afford it anymore, and we don\u2019t need to.\u000a\u000aSo give Obama credit for standing up for an important principle in a chaotic region. But also give the American people some credit. They\u2019re telling our leaders something important: It\u2019s hard to keep facing down Middle East Hitlers when there are no Churchills on the other side.
