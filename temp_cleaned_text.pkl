VHidden Obamacare Secret: \u201cRFID Chip Implants\u201d Mandatory for All by March 23, 2013\u000a\u000aAnd now we come to it. On Sunday March 21, 2010 the Senate Healthcare bill HR3200 was passed and signed into law the following Tuesday. Like I said before, there are a legion of horrible and just plain evil aspects to this bill and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard a lot them by now. I don\u2019t want to discount them but what cannot be missed here is this new law now opens a prophetic door on a magnitude not seen since the reformation of Israel.\u000a\u000aThis new law requires an RFID chip implanted in all of us. This chip will not only contain your personal information with tracking capability but it will also be linked to your bank account. And get this, Page 1004 of the new law (dictating the timing of this chip), reads, and I quote: "Not later than 36 months after the date of the enactment". It is now the law of the land that by March 23rd 2013 we will all be required to have an RFID chip underneath our skin and this chip will be link to our bank accounts as well as have our personal records and tracking capability built into it.\u000a\u000aIn just a minute I\u2019m going to show you the black and white of the law itself and you can see it with your own eyes and wonder why an event of this magnitude which is nothing less than seismic in nature is met with little more than silence in the Christian community.\u000a\u000aIs it now starting to dawn on you just where exactly we are in prophecy? I\u2019ll ask that question again in a minute and follow up on it, but now I want to show you the law itself. I\u2019ve downloaded a PDF copy of HR3200 from the government's website so what I\u2019m about to show you is from the bill itself its nothing that I\u2019ve written. You can access it all and see it all for yourself straight from the source itself.\u000a\u000aH.R. 3200 section 2521, Pg. 1001, paragraph 1.\u000a\u000aThe Secretary shall establish a national medical device registry (in this subsection referred to as the \u2018registry\u2019) to facilitate analysis of postmarket safety and outcomes data on each device that\u2014 \u2018\u2018is or has been used in or on a patient; \u2018\u2018and is\u2014 \u2018\u2018a class III device; or \u2018\u2018 , life-supporting, or life-sustaining.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat exactly is a class II device that is implantable? As you saw earlier, it is the device approved by the FDA in 2004.\u000a\u000aA class II implantable device is an "implantable radio frequency transponder system for patient identification and health information." The purpose of a class II device is to collect data in medical patients such as "claims data, patient survey data, standardized analytic files that allow for the pooling and analysis of data from disparate data environments, electronic health records, and any other data deemed appropriate by the Secretary."\u000a\u000aGoing back to what we just looked at, the creation of the national medical device registry in section 2521, page 1002 line 5:\u000a\u000aAnd the law continues on with a laundry list of items that the secretary must do in the process of creating this registry. In this laundry list of items to do, Line 17, subparagraph B: "validating methods for analyzing patient safety and outcomes data from multiple sources and for linking such data with the information included in the registry as described in subparagraph (A) "\u000a\u000aGoing back to subparagraph A [right above subparagraph B], it says: \u201cincluding in the registry, in a manner consistent with subsection (f), appropriate information to identify each device described in paragraph (1) by type, model, and serial number or other unique identifier;\u201d\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t be confused by the intentional obfuscation and skillful wording, This law first creates the national device registry and then immediately list all the task the secretary of health and human services will have do in the process of creating this registry.\u000a\u000aThe very first two items in the list mandates that the secretary first gives a unique identification to each of the items listed in paragraph 1 which is:\u000a\u000aThen, the very next thing the secretary is to do is to create the process by which \u201cpatient safety and outcomes data from multiple sources\u201d, which is electronic medical records, that are linked to these newly and uniquely identified items from paragraph 1 which are the class III and class II implantable devices.\u000a\u000aClass III devises are items such as breast implants, pacemakers, heart valves, etc. A Class II device that is implantable is, as you seen from the FDA, an implantable radio frequency transponder, RFID chip. From breast implants, to pacemakers, to RFID chips which one is the only possible one that can used for the stated purpose in section B which is, \u201cfor linking such data with the information included in the registry\u201d? As we know from subsection A, the information in the registry is the name of a device. In plain speak, we are in a clear way being told that our electronic medical records are going to be linked to a class II implantable device!\u000a\u000aContinuing a few lines down in this same section, section B subsection ii on still on page 1002, the \u201cpatient safety and outcomes data from multiple sources\u201d, that is to be linked is clearly spelled out as electronic medical records. It reads:  \u201clink data obtained under clause (i) with information in the registry\u201d. Information in the registry is, as we know from subparagraph A, the name of the device. So what is the data obtained under clause i? Back up a few lines to clause i\u000a\u000aIt reads: \u201cobtain access to disparate sources of patient safety and outcomes data, including Federal health-related electronic data\u201d. Again, from breast implants, to pacemakers, to RFID chips which one is the only possible one that can used for the stated purpose in section B? That stated purpose is \u201cfor linking such data\u201d and the such data is electronic medical records.\u000a\u000aWhat we already have already seen in just the creation of this registry, is the device that will serve as the link, which is an RFID microchip that is categorized as a Class II implantable device, as well as what it will be the link for which is your electronic medical records.\u000a\u000aIn case the law wasn\u2019t clear enough on that point, still in the laundry list of things to do a few more lines down on the next page, page 1005\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Secretary to protect the public health; shall establish procedures to permit linkage of information submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A, remember subparagraph A is the class 2 implantable device reference) with patient safety and outcomes data obtained under paragraph (3, which is electronic medical records); and to permit analyses of linked data;\u201d\u000a\u000aContinuing on to page 1007, in the STANDARDS, IMPLEMENTATION CRITERIA, AND CERTIFICATION CRITERIA section, the secretary of health and human services is given full power to intact all mandates from the laundry list of to-do items in the creation process of the registry as well as dictate how the devises listed in the National Medical Device Registry are to be used and implemented.\u000a\u000a"The Secretary of the Health Human Services, acting through the head of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, shall adopt standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for the electronic exchange and use in certified electronic health records of a unique device identifier for each device described in paragraph 1 (National Medical Device Registry), if such an identifier is required by section 519(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360i(f)) for the device."\u000a\u000aNow on Page 503, section E Lines 13-17 and I quote: "encourage, as appropriate, the development and use of clinical registries and the development of clinical effectiveness research data networks from electronic health records, post marketing drug and ". Let me say that again, !\u000a\u000aNow lets look at section 163 of HR3200, which gives the government a direct electronic access to your bank account which will work in conjunction with an implanted chip.\u000a\u000aPage 58 Lines 5 through 15 reads:\u000a\u000a(D) enable the real-time (or near real time) determination of an individual\u2019s financial responsibility at the point of service and, to the extent possible, prior to service, including whether the individual is eligible for a specific service with a specific physician at a specific facility, which may include utilization of a machine-readable health plan beneficiary identity detection card; (E) enable, where feasible, near real-time adjudication of claims\u000a\u000aWhat does this mean? It means that the government will give everybody a health ID card that contains a machine readable device (magnetic strip or RFID chip) similar to a credit card. Embedded in this chip or strip is your Health Identification Number. When you visit a medical provider, the medical claims will be processed while you are still in the office. The medical providers will be paid in real time. The portion that you owe will be deducted from your bank account, in real time, according to HR 3200.\u000a\u000aNotice here in this part which is at the beginning of 2000 plus pages of the law, it is carefully worded \u201cwhich may include utilization of a machine-readable health plan beneficiary identity detection card\u201d. Here we are told that it may be a card. As you have already seen, deeper in the law [Sec. 2521 Pg. 1000] what this \u201cmay\u201d utilize is clearly spelled out as a \u201cclass II device that is implantable\u201d.\u000a\u000aWe can only speculate at this point why the law is set up this way. Most likely this section was written to account for the gap in time from when the process of chipping begins to when everyone has received a chip. A means of starting with a card for the sake of expedience while the process of chipping citizenry plays out. One thing is certain, the law mandates that within 3 years we will all have a chip under our skin that will serve this purpose.\u000a\u000aEvidence of this logic is found in the deadline set for the start of the registry on page 1006.\u000a\u000a"EFFECTIVE DATE.\u2014The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish and begin implementation of the registry under section 519(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as added by paragraph (1), by not later than the date that is 36 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, without regard to whether or not final regulations to establish and operate the registry have been promulgated by such date."\u000a\u000aAlso on page 259, this law requires the use of Electronic medical records system in all hospitals by 2012 which will leave a gap of at least a year before the class II implantable device is required.\u000a\u000aRepublican Congressman Ron Paul from Texas, states on his website:\u000a\u000a"Buried deep within the over 1,000 pages of the massive US Health Care Bill (PDF) in a \u201cnon-discussed\u201d section titled: Subtitle C-11 Sec. 2521\u2014 National Medical Device Registry, and which states its purpose as\u2026\u2026.. He quotes that part of the law and then goes on to say: "In \u201creal world speak\u201d, according to this report, this new law, when fully implemented, provides the framework for making the United States the first Nation in the World to require each and every one of its citizens to have implanted in them a radio-frequency identification microchip for the purpose of controlling who is, or isn\u2019t, allowed medical care in their country".\u000a\u000aThat is from a currently serving member of congress. Cutting through all the political ease, the bottom line is that eventually if you want to participate in a government healthcare plan you will have to have this chip implanted in you. This law mandates that you have to have insurance and by virtue of this law guarantees that all private healthcare insurers will be driven out of business with only the government option left. We will be in a single payer system and you will have to have an imbedded chip to be a member of this system and it is mandatory that you be a part of this system.\u000a\u000aThis was published on the Telegraph's website a few months ago in instalments. It depicts terrorist attacks occurring across the western world, and the resulting measures taken by the government/ Illuminati. Some of the things it predicts is another world war (nuclear), a new centralised government, a single currency for the America's, massive loss of freedoms and civil liberties, mandatory ID Cards and RFID chips, Mass censorship of the internet, detention of people in FEMA camps.\u000a\u000aIs this another example of predictive programming in the mainstream media, or is this one of their cryptic warnings? I don't know but this really does send a shiver down your spine. Make up your own mind.\u000a\u000aI would also recommend Eathlasthope's new mini documentary on this.\u000a\u000aThe slide show on the telegraph: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/4220575/Blackjack\u2026.
